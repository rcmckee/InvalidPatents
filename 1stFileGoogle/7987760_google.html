    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application claims priority to and thus the benefit of an earlier filing date from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/678,240 (filed May 3, 2005), the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="p-0004">The invention generally relates to the ignition of explosive devices. More particularly, the invention relates to igniting explosive devices from a defensive perspective (e.g., to explode land mines, improvised explosive devices, roadside bombs, etc.).</p>
    <p num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Attacks by opposing forces (e.g., military enemies, terrorists and/or militant groups) exist in a variety of forms. Such attacks often include more covert aggression in the form of entrapment devices, or booby-traps, such as landmines and IEDs. These entrapment devices are exceptionally hazardous and often result in lost lives of peacekeeping forces and damage to vehicles and other equipment. Moreover, the groups of people using such devices are typically unorganized and rely on unconventional methods of attack. When these devices are not used, they are often forgotten about and remain as a hazard to a non-combatant.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Landmines can be pressure sensitive devices that ignite based on the depression of a triggering mechanism. Such explosive devices may be ignited simply by means of dragging weighted objects across the ground where a landmines lies. For example, during the Vietnam War, helicopters would drag heavy and large metal platforms across the ground to ignite such devices. While this method may still be useful in igniting such devices, it is substantially ineffective at igniting electronically triggered explosive devices, such as IEDs because such devices are not typically designed to ignite upon physical force. Other means for igniting explosive devices also exist such as that illustrated at http://www.eschel.co.il/dui/products/s/souvim.htm.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0008">The invention generally relates to systems and methods for igniting or disabling explosives. More particularly, the invention relates to igniting or disabling explosive devices, such as landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (“IED”; e.g., “roadside bombs”). In one embodiment of the invention, a strong electric field is generated to cause electric current flow to an explosive device. The electric current is used to thereby ignite explosive material therein (e.g., those materials listed at http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/explosives-uno.htm and http://www.atf.gov/pub/fire-explo_pub/listofexp.htm) and/or disable the detonating electronics while personnel and/or equipment are at a safe “standoff” distance. For example, IEDs are often placed underground or roadside by terrorists and are connected to some sort of triggering mechanism (e.g., a switch in communication with a cellular telephone, or wires connected to a remote switch). The triggering mechanism may be used by terrorists to ignite the IED when, for example, a terrorist's target passes by. Ignition of the IED is intended to confuse, disable and/or destroy the terrorist's target. Ignition or disabling of the IED, with the techniques of the present invention, prior to its intended ignition by the terrorist may substantially reduce the effectiveness of such explosive devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In one embodiment of the invention, electrical energy is transmitted (e.g., capacitively, inductively, and/or through direct discharges) proximate to the explosive device or wires connected thereto from a distally positioned probe to ignite the device. For example, electrical energy may be directly discharged from an electrode to the explosive device. The electrical energy may directly ignite the explosive device through heating and/or indirectly trigger the device by means of electrical propagation through the device's circuitry. The probe, therefore, may provide a safer “standoff” distance. Additionally, the probe may be configured from expendable components such that it may be sacrificed if the explosive is ignited.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In one embodiment of the invention, a relatively strong electric field is generated in the vicinity of the explosive device in order to induce electric current that may heat the device. For example, the strong electric field may be such that an induced electric current flows within components of the explosive device (e.g., wires, metal housing and/or the explosive material itself). Additionally, a strong electric field passing in the vicinity of the explosive device may cause electric current to “arc” about metallic edges of the housing and/or current to flow within wires of the device. This electric current may subsequently flow through the trigger, bridgewire, and/or the explosive material of the device to ignite the explosive material. Those skilled in the art are readily familiar with such components. Alternatively, the electric current may damage and/or disable electrical components required to trigger the explosive device (e.g., a discharge across an open switch can close the triggering circuit thereby disabling it). For example, the electrical energy discharge may damage receiver electronics of an explosive device that uses radio triggering. Also, electronic memory of explosive device in may be reset or changed thereby disabling the operations without necessarily causing physical damage to the device. In either case, the explosive device may be rendered inoperable.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">In another embodiment, the electric field is generated using a Tesla coil. Other exemplary embodiments, however, may include high-voltage generators, such as those developed by a North Star Research Corp. Additionally, such high-voltage generators may be used to supply electric charge to the Tesla coil.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">In addition or in the alternative, the strong electric field may create an electrical breakdown in the gas (e.g., air) between the source of the electric field and the explosive device. This breakdown causes electric current to be conducted directly into the device and/or wires connected thereto. This electric current may thereby ignite the explosive material of the device and/or disable the triggering electronics. The electric field may be strong enough to provide an arc of electric current to the device, even if the device is underground. For example, it is well-known that electric current conducted to ground (e.g., earth ground) dissipates within the ground just as lightning dissipates within the ground during a strike. However, a strong enough electric field may create a dielectric breakdown of the air that arcs to ground and penetrates the surface of the ground to some variable depth. This ground penetrating electric current may flow to the explosive device and ignite the explosive material therein. Again, embodiments may include using Tesla coils and/or high-voltage generators such as those described hereinabove to generate the electric field.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In another embodiment, the electromagnetic energy may be created in the microwave range of frequencies. This electromagnetic energy may be used to ignite an explosive device, such as one buried underground. This electromagnetic energy may be received by the device that may heat the explosive's ignition electronics leading to the ignition of the explosive device. For example, the ignition electronics may include a bridgewire, electric fuse, circuitry, power supply, communications, etc. The microwave energy may be propagated through a waveguide instead of broadcast propagation of the energy over a standoff distance. Such directed microwave energy may allow higher radiant intensities to be placed at the explosive device. In another embodiment, electrical energy may be coupled to the explosive device electronics through oscillating magnetic fields. For example, wires attached to the explosive device may inductively receive voltages from the oscillating magnetic flux at causes the explosive device to ignite.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">The above-mentioned embodiments may be deployed in a variety of ways. For example, a high-voltage generator may be mounted to a vehicle (e.g., a “wheeled” vehicle, a helicopter, etc.) that travels ahead of a formation (e.g., a single person, a battalion, a group of vehicles, etc.). The vehicle may have one or more arms or “booms” that extend and/or dangle from the vehicle. These booms may include electrodes that are electrically coupled to the high-voltage generator to provide a strong electric and/or magnetic field in the vicinity of an explosive device to thereby ignite the device as described hereinabove.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">Other manners in which the above embodiments may be deployed may include, for example, a “double headed” Tesla coil coupled to a high-voltage generator. The Tesla coil may step up the voltage from the high-voltage generator through known means of inductance to create strong electric fields in the vicinity of an explosive device. In one embodiment, the double headed Tesla coil oscillates voltage of the two Tesla coil heads between a high positive voltage and a high negative voltage. The strong electric field of each Tesla coil head and the voltage oscillation thereof may produce substantial electric effects which may enhance ignition of an explosive device.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">The double headed Tesla coil embodiment may include collapsible/expandable components which enhance shipping abilities. For example, “arms” in the inductive transformer windings of the double headed Tesla coil may be collapsed into smaller components for shipment and expanded into larger components during deployment.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Once an explosive device is ignited, electrodes and/or Tesla coils coupled to the high-voltage generator may be destroyed because of the close proximity to the ignition. In one embodiment, the electrodes and/or the Tesla coils are configured of inexpensive materials, such as metal foils. Additionally, the electrodes and/or the Tesla coils may be configured in such a way as to allow for rapid deployment. For example, once an electrode is destroyed by ignition of an explosive device, the electrode may be rapidly connected to the high-voltage generator through preconfigured couplings. Similarly, the Tesla coil may be inexpensively designed for rapid replacement in the event of damage during an IED initiation. Such embodiments may prove to be advantageous because, among other reasons, the increasing frequency of IED attacks may make it highly desirable to quickly replace and install new electrodes.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">As used herein, a probe generally refers to a device used to disable an explosive device. For example, a probe may employ electromagnetic radiation and/or electrical discharge to ignite an explosive device or disable triggering mechanisms thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">In one embodiment of the invention, a system used to ignite an explosive includes: a generator that generates transferable energy; one or more electrodes that transfer the energy to the explosive via an electric discharge, wherein the energy is used to ignite the explosive; and a vehicle that transports the generator and the electrode, wherein the vehicle comprises a boom that distally positions the one or more electrodes from the generator. Examples of such an explosive may include a land mine, an improvised explosive device, and a combustible material.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">The transferable energy may be time varying energy, such as Alternating Current electric energy. For example, the generator may be a high-voltage generator configured for generating between about 12 and 16 kilovolts. The system may also include a Tesla coil configured between the generator and the one or more electrodes for providing the transferable energy from the generator to the one or more electrodes.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">The one or more electrodes may be distally positioned from the explosive. Additionally, the one or more electrodes may discharge through a substantially constant point. Alternatively, or in addition to, at least one of the one or more electrodes may include a surface that is substantially horizontal, wherein the surface discharges at one or more points on the surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">The vehicle may include armor to inhibit damage to the vehicle when the explosive ignites. The vehicle may be remotely piloted or piloted by a person.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">In another embodiment of the invention, a system used to ignite an explosive includes: a generator that generates transferable energy; and a waveguide that directionally transmits the energy to the explosive, wherein the energy is used to ignite the explosive; and a vehicle that transports the generator and the waveguide, wherein the vehicle comprises a boom that distally positions the waveguide from the generator. The waveguide may be distally positioned from the explosive. The transferable energy may include time varying energy, such as microwave radio frequency energy.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">In another embodiment of the invention, a system used to ignite an explosive includes: a generator that provides electric current through a conductor; a means for providing an energy field in communication with the generator, wherein the energy field is used to ignite the explosive; and a vehicle that transports the generator and the means for providing an energy field, wherein the vehicle comprises a boom that distally positions the means for providing an energy field from the generator. The energy field may be an electric field and/or a magnetic field.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">In another embodiment invention, a system used to ignite an explosive includes: a generator that provides electric current through a conductor; a means for providing an electric field in communication with the generator, wherein the electric field is used to ignite the explosive; and a vehicle that transports the generator and the means for providing an electric field, wherein the vehicle comprises a boom that distally positions the means for providing an electric field from the generator.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">In another embodiment invention, a system used to ignite an explosive includes: a voltage generator; a transformer electrically coupled to the voltage generator and configured for increasing the voltage therefrom; a discharge unit configured using increased voltage to ignite the explosive; and a vehicle that transports the voltage generator, the transformer, and the discharge unit, wherein the vehicle comprises a boom that distally positions the discharge unit from the voltage generator.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">The discharge unit may be further configured for generating an arc of electric current from the increased voltage to the explosive to thereby ignite the explosive. The discharge unit may also be further configured for generating an electric field to induce electric current with the explosive from the increased voltage to thereby ignite the explosive. The discharge unit may include a Tesla coil. The discharge unit may also be expandable.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">In one embodiment of the invention, a system used to ignite an explosive includes: a generator that generates transferable energy; and an electrode that transfers the energy to the explosive via an electric discharge, wherein the energy is used to ignite the explosive.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading> <p num="p-0051">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that it is not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the claims.</p>
    <p num="p-0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates system <b>100</b> for igniting an explosive device <b>104</b> by conducting (e.g., “arcing”) electric current <b>103</b> to the device, in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The explosive device <b>104</b> may be buried in ground <b>106</b>. For example, an opposing force (e.g., a terrorist, a militant group, and/or a military enemy) may bury an explosive device to covertly create confusion with, damage and/or destroy a peacekeeping force. Examples of such attacks have been seen in Vietnam where landmines were the popular means for covertly attacking United States peacekeeping forces. Other examples include the use of IEDs in postwar Iraq against the United States peacekeeping forces.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">System <b>100</b> includes a high-voltage generator <b>101</b> (i.e., labeled HVG <b>101</b>) configured for generating a substantially high-voltage. For example, HVG <b>101</b> may be a voltage generator capable of generating voltages of 200 kilovolts or higher. HVG <b>101</b> is electrically coupled to electrode <b>102</b>, which subsequently provides electric current in the form of electric current arcs <b>103</b> through region <b>105</b> (e.g., a gas such as air) and possibly through ground <b>106</b> to explosive device <b>104</b>. The electric current provided by electrode <b>102</b> may cause electric current to flow within explosive device <b>101</b>. For example, the electric current may flow through wires, housing components, and/or the explosive material itself of explosive device <b>104</b>. This current flow may directly ignite explosive device <b>104</b> without causing damage to units therebehind (e.g., people, vehicles, other equipment, etc.). Alternatively, electric current may be used to disable explosive device <b>104</b> by either physically damaging circuitry of the explosive device and/or by disabling processing features of the device (e.g., by scrambling or deleting computer memory).</p>
    <p num="p-0054">In one embodiment of the invention, high-voltage generator <b>101</b> includes a Tesla coil configured for delivering the electrical energy. In such an embodiment, the Tesla coil may be configured with elements that provide means for discharging electrical energy from the Tesla coil. For example, a device such as a Tesla coil can obtain very high voltages capable of generating electrical discharge via air breakdown over relatively large distances. Conduction paths leading away from a Tesla coil can be enhanced through elements configured on electrode <b>102</b>, such as ridges or other features that tend to direct the electrical energy in some manner. With a large enough charge delivered to the Tesla coil, the ability of that charge to break down insulative characteristics of region <b>105</b> (e.g., air) is increased to create a conduction path to explosive device <b>104</b>. Those skilled in the art are readily familiar with Tesla coils and their abilities to discharge electrical energy.</p>
    <p num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another system <b>150</b> for igniting an explosive device <b>104</b> by generating a strong electric field <b>107</b> in the vicinity of the explosive device, in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. System <b>150</b> includes HVG <b>101</b> to generate a substantially high-voltage as described hereinabove. System <b>150</b> also includes an electrode <b>108</b> which holds an electric charge from HVG <b>101</b>. For example, electrode <b>108</b> may function as a capacitor plate which creates a strong electric field <b>107</b> in the presence of a dielectric, such as region <b>105</b>. Dielectrics and capacitance are well-known to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">Electric field <b>107</b> may be strong enough to penetrate ground <b>106</b> and introduce electric current flow in explosive device <b>104</b>. For example, the presence of electric field <b>107</b> in the vicinity of explosive device <b>104</b> may create arcs of electric current between conductible components of explosive device <b>104</b> and/or create electric current to flow through the explosive material of the device itself, directly and/or inductively. This electric current may be sufficient to ignite the explosive material of explosive device <b>107</b>. Moreover, the heat generated by the electric field may be sufficient to ignite explosive device <b>107</b>. In one embodiment, electric field <b>107</b> is an alternating or time-varying electric field used to provide sustained heating of the explosive device <b>107</b>. For example, the electric current provided to electrode <b>108</b> may be alternating electric current (“AC”) that is used to generate a corresponding alternating electric field with electrode <b>108</b>. Accordingly, HVG <b>101</b> may be a high voltage AC generator.</p>
    <p num="p-0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates yet another system <b>200</b> for igniting an explosive device <b>104</b> by propagating electromagnetic energy <b>205</b> through region <b>105</b>, in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, system <b>200</b> includes a microwave generator <b>202</b> configured for generating electromagnetic energy in the microwave frequency region. System also <b>200</b> includes a waveguide <b>203</b> for transmitting the microwave energy over a suitable standoff distance to microwave horn <b>204</b>. Microwave horn <b>204</b> transmits the microwave energy over a relatively short distance to explosive device <b>104</b>. The electromagnetic energy <b>205</b> may be sufficient to penetrate ground <b>106</b> and propagate directly to explosive device <b>104</b>. Electromagnetic energy may directly ignite explosive device <b>104</b> through the deposition of electrical energy to the device. Alternatively, or in addition to, electromagnetic energy may indirectly ignite the explosive device <b>104</b> through heat generation or through the induction of currents within the device. For example, as electromagnetic energy <b>205</b> radiates, dielectric losses often translate into the generation of heat. The generated heat may be sufficient to ignite explosive device <b>104</b>. Those skilled in the art should readily recognize that electromagnetic energy of other frequency ranges may be suitable for explosive device ignition.</p>
    <p num="p-0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a ground vehicle <b>301</b> operable with an explosive device ignition system, such as systems <b>100</b> and <b>150</b> shown and described hereinabove, in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, ground vehicle <b>301</b> includes a boom <b>302</b> which operates as an arm to support electrode <b>102</b>/<b>108</b>. Electrode <b>102</b>/<b>108</b> is electrically coupled to HVG <b>101</b> to deliver electric current to explosive device <b>104</b> and thereby ignite the device in accordance with the aspects and features of the invention as described hereinabove. HVG <b>101</b> may be carried on ground vehicle <b>301</b> or by another vehicle. Ground vehicle <b>301</b> may be man-piloted or piloted via remote control. Those skilled in the art are readily familiar with the various manners in which a ground vehicle may be piloted via remote control.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">Boom <b>302</b> is configured to deliver electric current to explosive device <b>104</b> in a manner that distances the ignition from ground vehicle <b>301</b>. Accordingly, damage is typically only sustained to electrode <b>102</b>/<b>108</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, electrodes <b>102</b>/<b>108</b> are configured of inexpensive materials and are connectable in such a way as to allow for rapid replacement. Those skilled in the art are readily familiar with such materials and connections that may be used for electrode <b>102</b>/<b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">While one embodiment has been shown and described, those skilled in the art should readily recognize that the invention is not intended to be limited to the illustrated embodiment. For example, ground vehicle <b>301</b> may be configured in other ways which allow for HVG <b>101</b> to deliver electric current to electrode <b>102</b>/<b>108</b> from a distance to substantially prevent damage to ground vehicle <b>301</b> upon ignition of explosive device <b>104</b>. Additionally, the invention should not be limited to the single boom <b>302</b> and/or electrodes <b>102</b>/<b>108</b>. Other embodiments may include a plurality of electrodes <b>102</b>/<b>108</b> attached to one or more booms <b>302</b>. For example, a plurality of electrodes <b>102</b>/<b>108</b> may be configured in a rake configuration which allows for electrostatic discharge to explosive device <b>104</b> from one or more discharge points.</p>

For example, air vehicle <b>304</b> may be configured to “dangle” electrode <b>102</b> to conduct (e.g., arc) electric current <b>103</b> to explosive device <b>104</b> within ground <b>106</b> and thereby ignite explosive device <b>104</b>. Electrode <b>102</b> may be dangled at a distance from the air vehicle <b>304</b> which would substantially reduce danger from ignition of explosive device <b>104</b>. As with ground vehicle <b>301</b>, air vehicle <b>304</b> may be man-piloted or piloted via remote control.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">In this embodiment, electrode <b>102</b> may include a Tesla coil that is coupled to HVG <b>101</b>. Within this coupling, voltage from HVG <b>101</b> may be “stepped up” to a higher voltage than that generated by HVG <b>101</b> through the use of a Tesla coil <b>305</b>. Tesla Coil <b>305</b> has a primary side coupled to HVG <b>101</b> which induces electric current within a secondary side <b>305</b>.

Tesla Coils and their respective configurations are well-known to those skilled in the art and their implementations are typically a matter of design choice. Air vehicle <b>304</b> may include a cable <b>306</b> that is used as a tether between the air vehicle and nearby ground vehicle <b>301</b>. For example, HVG <b>101</b> may be configured with ground vehicle <b>301</b> such that high-voltage generation is not performed upon air vehicle <b>304</b>; rather it is generated upon ground vehicle <b>301</b> and transferred to electrode <b>102</b> via high-voltage cables <b>307</b>. Such a configuration may reduce the weight of an aircraft. Alternatively, the tethered connection between the ground vehicle <b>301</b> and the air vehicle <b>304</b> may include power and control for the air vehicle as well as the electrical energy from the HVG <b>101</b>.

    <p num="p-0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a circuit diagram of an explosive device ignition system <b>400</b>, in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, explosive device ignition system <b>400</b> includes a high-voltage source <b>401</b> coupled in parallel with high-voltage capacitor <b>405</b>. High-voltage capacitor <b>405</b> is charged by source <b>401</b> and is coupled to primary side <b>402</b> of transformer <b>409</b> via switch <b>404</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, switch <b>404</b> is a high-voltage thyratron capable of conducting current to primary side <b>402</b> until capacitor <b>405</b> is charge-depleted, at which time the switch <b>404</b> opens. Those skilled in the art are readily familiar with thyratrons. The invention, however, is not intended to be limited to thyratrons. Rather, other switches may be used such as those particularly well suited for high voltage coupling (e.g., thyristors).</p>
    <p num="p-0064">Primary side <b>402</b>, secondary side <b>403</b> and capacitor plate <b>406</b> of capacitor <b>412</b> may be representative of a Tesla coil. For example, a Tesla Coil is a resonantly coupled device. A charge on capacitor <b>412</b> may provide an alternating voltage (e.g., AC voltage). As the coil “rings up”, eventually the voltage may exceed the voltage required to discharge through air. The discharge may actually grow over several oscillations of the coil, until it reaches ground and delivers energy in the coupled Tesla Coil system.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">In this regard, capacitor <b>412</b> may be representative of the electrode(s), breakdown region and explosive device described hereinabove. As electric current is conducted through primary side <b>402</b>, electric current is induced through secondary side <b>403</b>. Current induced in secondary side <b>403</b> is used to charge capacitor <b>412</b>. Dielectric region <b>410</b> may be representative of region <b>105</b> and capacitor plate <b>411</b> may be representative of explosive device <b>104</b>, as described hereinabove. The electric current short-circuiting through capacitor <b>412</b> may be sufficient to ignite an explosive device <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">While the invention is generally directed towards Tesla coils, those skilled in the art should readily recognize that other embodiments may include other high voltage devices. Accordingly, invention is not intended be limited to a particular type of high-voltage delivery system.</p>
    <p num="p-0067"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates another ground vehicle <b>500</b> operable with a “double headed” Tesla coil used as an explosive device ignition system, in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. For example, one “head” <b>510</b> <i>a </i>of the Tesla coil may include a charge holding electrode <b>502</b> <i>a </i>that receives charge from a secondary side <b>504</b> <i>a</i>. The secondary side <b>504</b> <i>a </i>may have current induced therein by primary side <b>506</b>. As such, secondary side <b>504</b> <i>a </i>and primary side <b>506</b> may form a transformer which receives voltage from a high-voltage source and steps up that voltage to deliver charge to charge holding electrode <b>502</b> <i>a </i>(e.g., a toroid). The second head <b>510</b> <i>b </i>may be configured in a similar manner.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">In one embodiment of the invention, primary side <b>506</b> is a one or more windings that induces electric current in the windings of secondary sides <b>504</b> <i>a </i>and <b>504</b> <i>b</i>. Primary side <b>506</b> may induce electric current in an Alternating Current (“AC”) fashion. In this embodiment, while head <b>510</b> <i>a </i>experiences a charge of positive high-voltage, head <b>510</b> <i>b </i>experiences a charge of negative high-voltage. AC may enhance electrical ignition of explosive device <b>104</b> through the large swings, or oscillating surges, of current through explosive device <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">Electrical charge builds on the charge holding electrodes <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>which discharges as arcs <b>103</b> of electric current. To enhance discharge, the charge holding electrodes <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>may include discharge elements <b>503</b> <i>a </i>and <b>503</b> <i>b</i>, respectively. For example, discharge elements <b>503</b> <i>a </i>and <b>503</b> <i>b </i>may be elements, such as spikes, ridges, or other protrusions on charge holding electrodes <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b</i>. These features of charge holding electrodes <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>extend from the charge holding electrode's surface so as to focus electric charge to a point and thereby enhance electrostatic discharge. These elements may be spaced apart in a pattern and/or randomly configured randomly so that such that they reduce the distance between ground <b>106</b> and charge holding electrodes <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>in some periodic manner (e.g., as each charge holding electrode rotates). The charge on the charge holding electrodes <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>may be such that arcs <b>103</b> of electric current are strong enough to penetrate ground <b>106</b> and conduct current to and/or through explosive device <b>104</b>. Those skilled in the art are familiar with Tesla coils. One example of a Tesla coil is shown and described below in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">The ground vehicle <b>500</b> used to deploy such a double headed Tesla coil may include wheel <b>507</b> and axle <b>508</b>. Wheel <b>507</b> and axle <b>508</b> may be used to propel ground vehicle <b>500</b>. Additionally, wheel <b>507</b> and axle <b>508</b> may be used to rotate charge holding electrodes <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>as wheel <b>507</b> turns. For example, when electrical discharge to ground does not sufficiently connect to the explosive device, mechanical variation in the electrode may disrupt the electrical discharge connection allowing a new discharge to be established at a new location. Such may lead to an improved probability of the discharge connecting to the explosive device.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">The size of wheel <b>507</b> may be taken into consideration when designing a double headed Tesla coil. For example, design considerations may include the distance in which each charge holding electrode <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>is suspended above ground <b>106</b>. The distance between a charge holding electrode <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>and ground <b>106</b> may determine the amount of charge supplied to each charge holding electrode <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>and/or the size of each charge holding electrode <b>502</b>. Greater distances between a charge holding electrode <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>and ground <b>106</b> may require more charge to be delivered to each charge holding electrode. Additionally, the size of wheel <b>507</b> may dictate the size of each charge holding electrode <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b </i>since the size of wheel <b>507</b> determines axial placement of the charge holding electrodes.</p>
    <p num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the ground vehicle <b>500</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows how the double headed Tesla coil may be configured with a “cart-like” body <b>520</b> supported and movable via wheel <b>507</b> and wheels <b>521</b>. HVG <b>101</b> is used to generate voltage and conduct that voltage to the transformer that is primary side <b>506</b> and secondary side <b>504</b>. In one embodiment, HVG <b>101</b> is mounted to a powered vehicle that follows behind ground vehicle <b>500</b>. For example, components of ground vehicle <b>500</b> may be included partly or entirely of lesser expensive materials such that when an explosive device <b>104</b> is ignited, the ground vehicle <b>500</b> may be rapidly replaced and/or repaired. Additionally, portions of ground vehicle <b>500</b>, such as the secondary sides <b>504</b> <i>a </i>and <b>504</b> <i>b </i>and charge holding electrodes <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and <b>502</b> <i>b</i>, may be collapsible for compact storage. High-voltage generators, such as HVG <b>101</b>, are typically more complex and/or expensive devices. By placing HVG <b>101</b> behind ground vehicle <b>500</b>, damage or destruction to HVG <b>101</b> may be substantially prevented.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">A trade-off between the size of the electric field generated by the electrodes and the magnitude of the field at some distance apart from the electrode may exist. For example, it may be preferable for the radius of a spherical electrode to be proportional to or nearly the same as the distance from the ground. Also, time dependent electric fields may yield repeated, periodic discharges and/or heat an explosive device. In one embodiment, a Marx generator could be used to charge multiple capacitors in series and then place them together in parallel to achieve higher voltages. Additionally, other electrical circuitry could be used to provide more electrical energy once an electrical discharge is established and sensed. Alternatively, ground vehicle <b>500</b> may be configured with a microwave feed that is placed in proximity to ground <b>106</b> such that microwave energy is transmitted by a waveguide to remotely ignite explosive devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">Other embodiments may include a vehicle that tows electrodes/microwave feeds (e.g., either in front of or behind the vehicle) to ignite the explosive device. Such vehicles may be configured with booms or arms that are pivotable or otherwise movable relative to the vehicle. Further, a control mechanism may be configured with the remote vehicle to change the position of the boom. Sufficient standoff distances may vary depending on many factors such as the strength of the explosive device, whether or not it is buried in the ground, the depth to which it is buried, the protection on the humans or equipment, and so forth. Examples as such embodiments are illustrated below in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 17</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">Advantages of a double headed Tesla coil may include better flux coupling (i.e., more efficient coupling from primary side <b>506</b> to secondary sides <b>504</b> <i>a </i>and <b>504</b> <i>b</i>). Additionally, the double headed Tesla coil increases coverage area by providing for provides for electrical energy discharges on both sides of ground vehicle <b>500</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0076"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates probe <b>550</b> for providing electrical discharge <b>551</b> to an explosive device or a wire <b>552</b> thereof, in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. For example, probe <b>550</b> may be electrically coupled to a high-voltage generation device, such as those described hereinabove, to electrically discharge through region <b>105</b> (e.g., air) to a component of an explosive device (e.g., wire <b>552</b>). Probe <b>550</b> may be configured to initiate electrical discharge <b>551</b> such that electrical breakdown of region <b>105</b> will occur and conduct to wire <b>552</b> to ignite an explosive device coupled thereto.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">Such electrical breakdown of region <b>105</b> may occur when electric potential between probe <b>550</b> and wire <b>552</b> reaches a certain level. For example, electric breakdown of air may depend on, among other things, particulates in the air and/or distance between probe <b>550</b> and wire <b>552</b>. Once the electric potential reaches a level high enough to overcome, for example, the insulative features of the air, electrical discharge <b>551</b> may conduct to wire <b>552</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">In some instances, electrical discharge <b>551</b> may be strong enough to penetrate ground <b>106</b> and conduct directly to wire <b>552</b>. Such electrical conduction may also be the result of inductive influences upon wire <b>552</b> as electrical discharge <b>551</b> penetrates ground <b>106</b>. Those skilled in the art should readily recognize, however, that the invention is not intended to be limited to a particular type of conduction within wire <b>552</b> and/or an explosive device coupled thereto.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">Probe <b>550</b> may be useful in providing electrical energy discharges to relatively small areas. For example, tip <b>553</b> of probe <b>550</b> may provide certain features that preferentially direct discharge of the electrical energy. The invention, however, is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown and described herein. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates probe <b>600</b> having certain features that allow for discharge of electrical energy where distance between probe <b>600</b> and an object (e.g., an explosive device and/or circuitry thereof) may vary.</p>
    <p num="p-0080"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates probe <b>550</b> with blower <b>561</b> for providing electrical discharge <b>551</b> to explosive device <b>104</b>, in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, probe <b>550</b> is configured with a boom <b>560</b> to electrically discharge to explosive device <b>104</b> from a distance that offers relative safety from an explosion thereof. Blower <b>561</b> may blow air <b>562</b> to at least partially unearth explosive device <b>104</b>. For example, air <b>562</b> blown across ground <b>106</b> at a sufficient pressure may cause ground <b>106</b> to “stir” and disperse from a buried explosive device, such as a land mine, an IED, etc. Accordingly, explosive device <b>104</b> may be revealed and conduction of electrical discharge <b>551</b> to the explosive device may be improved. A close-up view of such as exemplarily illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">Additionally, particulates <b>564</b> caused by the disruption of ground <b>106</b> may also improve conduction of electrical discharge <b>551</b>. For example, ground <b>106</b> may include materials that are conductive. Furthermore, particulates in the air may enhance local electric field effects that reduce breakdown thresholds. Accordingly, particulates <b>564</b> may cause a conductive path between probe <b>550</b> and explosive device <b>104</b>. The conduction of electrical discharge <b>551</b> may thereby directly ignite explosive device <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">Also configured with probe <b>550</b> is Tesla coil <b>563</b>. Tesla coil <b>563</b> provides electrical energy to probe <b>550</b> such that electrical discharge <b>551</b> may be generated. Tesla coil <b>563</b> may be configured in a variety ways known to those skilled in the art, such as those described hereinabove.</p>
    <p num="p-0083"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates probe/blower <b>570</b> for providing electrical discharge <b>574</b> to explosive device <b>104</b>, in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, probe/blower <b>570</b> configures blower functionality, such as that of blower <b>561</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, with probe functionality, such as that of probe <b>550</b>. For example, probe/blower <b>570</b> may be a vented structure with holes <b>570</b> through which gas (e.g. air) <b>573</b> is forced. Additionally, probe/blower <b>570</b> may be configured from material that is conducive for maintaining electrical energy (e.g., copper, aluminum, or other conductive materials) such that the probe/blower may electrically discharge to explosive device <b>104</b> or wire <b>552</b> connected thereto.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">The gas may also include particulates or aerosols to enhance the electrical discharge, for example, by reducing the voltage required for breakdown through effects such as local electrical field enhancement near the particulates. Particulates that are relatively easy to ionize may be selected to provide electrons to enhance discharge development. For example, an electric field within a particle may be reduced by charge movement or charge polarization. Charge displacement may enhance an electric field outside the particle. Local electric field enhancement around charged particles may enhance ionization and cascading electrical discharges at lower macroscopic electric field strengths.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">The gas may be something other than air and selected to enhance the discharge. For example a gas with a relatively low ionization potential or having less electro-negative components may allow for discharges over longer distances and/or for longer times while typically requiring less energy. One example of a gas that may be used already having particulates therewith is exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine, such as that commonly found in various vehicles. Moreover, electric discharge may be enhanced by heating the blown gas such that the gas and air obtains a lower density. For example, the breakdown potential of a gas is typically lowered at reduced densities, as is known to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0086"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates probe <b>600</b> configured for providing electrical discharge <b>601</b> to an explosive device (e.g., explosive device <b>104</b> described hereinabove) or a wire connected thereto (e.g., wire <b>552</b>), in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Probe <b>600</b> may be configured as a plate having an electrode edge <b>602</b> that advantageously directs electrical discharge <b>601</b> through region <b>105</b> towards an explosive device and/or a wire thereof. Focal edge <b>602</b> may allow for electrical discharge of varying distance between probe <b>600</b> and the explosive device. For example, probe <b>600</b> may discharge electrical energy to objects that protrude from ground <b>106</b>. Since the electric field strength is not focused to a particular point, such as probe <b>550</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, electrical energy may preferentially discharge from probe <b>600</b> to an object at the shortest distance between the object and the probe. This type of discharge may allow for probe <b>600</b> to “find” the object and discharge thereto.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">As described hereinabove, electrical discharge <b>601</b> may cause heating and/or electric current to flow through an explosive device and/or circuitry thereof. Such electric current may ignite the explosive device and/or disable its triggering mechanisms. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the probe of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>

Waveguide <b>625</b> may be configured with horn antenna <b>626</b> which advantageously directs electromagnetic energy <b>627</b> through region <b>105</b>, ground <b>106</b> and to explosive device <b>104</b>. Electromagnetic energy <b>627</b> in the microwave region or e.g. other radio frequency regions may advantageously penetrate through nonconductive material of ground <b>106</b>. As such, electromagnetic energy <b>627</b> may, as described hereinabove, cause heating and/or electrical current to flow in explosive device <b>104</b>.

In this embodiment probe <b>706</b> receives electrical energy from primary side <b>708</b> of Tesla coil <b>705</b> through coupling to secondary side <b>711</b> of the Tesla coil. The electrical energy is generated and controlled by high-voltage generator <b>701</b> and thyratron <b>703</b>. In one embodiment, the electrical energy provided to probe <b>706</b> is between about 12 and 16 kilovolts. High-voltage generator <b>701</b> and thyratron <b>703</b> are configured upon vehicle <b>702</b> and distally positioned from end <b>709</b> of probe <b>706</b>. To provide sufficient ground for high-voltage generator <b>701</b>, a conductive cable <b>711</b> may be affixed to vehicle <b>702</b> that drags upon the ground <b>712</b> and/or road <b>713</b>. For example, conductive cable <b>711</b> may be a chain or metal wire that drags upon ground <b>712</b> and/or road <b>713</b> behind vehicle <b>702</b> as the vehicle moves.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">Probe <b>706</b> may be affixed to boom <b>704</b> so as to position electrical discharge <b>707</b> away from vehicle <b>702</b>. By positioning electrical discharge <b>707</b> away from vehicle <b>702</b>, vehicle <b>702</b>, high-voltage generator <b>701</b> and other components may be located in a safe standoff position during ignition of explosive device <b>104</b>. Distance of boom <b>704</b> may depend on one or more of a plurality of factors. Such factors may include, for example, location of explosive device <b>104</b>, amount and type of explosive material of explosive device <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">In one embodiment of the invention, the Tesla coil is a 100 kHz Tesla coil having a primary side <b>402</b> constructed of copper tubing having a diameter of about 0.37 inches and wrapped 3 to 4 times around the outer PVC tubing. The spacing between each turn in the primary may be about 0.37 inches. The primary side <b>402</b> may be attached to high-voltage capacitors having a capacitance of about 0.4 μH. The capacitors may be charged to a voltage between 12 kV and 16 kV before current is switched through primary side <b>402</b> (e.g., using a thyratron).</p>

About 2464 feet of 0.0253 inch diameter copper wire is wound around the PVC tubing approximately 1176 times over the length of the coil. The secondary side <b>403</b> and may be inserted and centered into an outer PVC tubing having an outer diameter of about 13 inches. The outer PVC tubing may be filled with either transformer oil or a gas combination (e.g., SF6) to inhibit discharges. The outer PVC tubing is sealed to retain the fill.

For example, the electrical energy may be discharged at a particular repetition frequency. The repetition frequency of the discharge may be chosen in such a way as to deposit electrical energy multiple times within a thermal diffusion time of the explosive triggering device (e.g., 200 Hz).</p>

    <p num="p-0096">In this embodiment, vehicle <b>702</b> is configured with microwave RF generator <b>725</b> to generate electromagnetic energy <b>729</b> in the microwave or e.g. other radio frequency regions region.

    <p num="p-0098">While vehicle <b>702</b> is configured with a single probe (e.g., probe <b>706</b> or probe <b>747</b>), those skilled in the art should readily recognize that the invention is not intended to be limited to a single probe of the illustrate embodiments. Rather, vehicle <b>702</b> may be configured with a plurality of probes. Additionally, each probe may be configured according to one or more of the embodiments described hereinabove to ignite or otherwise disable explosive device <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, such illustration and description is to be considered as exemplary and not restrictive in character. For example, certain embodiments described hereinabove may be combinable with other described embodiments. Accordingly, it should be understood that only the preferred embodiment and minor variants thereof have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected.</p>
