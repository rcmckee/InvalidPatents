<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a continuing application which claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/272,851, which was filed Oct. 17, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,991,402, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention generally relates to the retention or detention of fluids, typically storm water, but may have other applications. Storm water retention and detention systems accommodate runoff at a given site by diverting or storing storm water and preventing pooling of water at the ground surface.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">An underground storm water retention or detention system is generally utilized when the surface area on a building site is not available to accommodate other types of systems such as open reservoirs, basins or ponds. The underground systems do not utilize valuable surface areas as compared to reservoirs, basins or ponds. Underground systems are also advantageous in that they present fewer public hazards than other systems. Another advantage is that underground systems avoid having open, standing water which would be conducive to mosquito breeding. Underground systems also avoid the aesthetic problems of other systems such as algae growth and weed growth which can occur in other systems. Thus it is beneficial to have an underground system to manage storm water effectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">One disadvantage of current underground systems is that they must accommodate existing or planned underground facilities such as utilities and other buried conduits. At the same time, the underground storm water retention or detention system must be effective in diverting storm water from the ground surface to another location. Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a modular underground system which has great versatility in the plan area form it can assume.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Another disadvantage of current underground systems is that they do not provide unrestricted storm water flow throughout the system. So it is desirous to provide a system which can permit relatively unconstrained flow throughout the system.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Underground systems must be able to withstand the traffic and earth loads which are applied to it without being prone to failure. So it is advantageous to provide an underground system which accommodates virtually any application of a load applied at the ground surface in addition to the weight of the earth surrounding the system.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">The present invention therefore relates to the configuration, production and use of modular sections, which are preferably precast concrete and are usually installed in a longitudinally and laterally aligned configuration to form underground channels for the retention and/or detention of storm water.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Different forms of underground storm water detention and/or retention structures have been either proposed or made, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,890,838 to Infiltrator Systems, Inc. of Old Saybrook, Conn. and marketed under the trade name the “Maximizer Chamber System.” Furthermore, other underground water conveyance structures such as pipe, box culvert, and bridge culvert made of various materials have been proposed or constructed for underground storm water detention and/or retention purposes. However, the underground structures that have been previously proposed or constructed are designed for other applications and fail to provide one or more of the above advantages, as apparent after studying and analyzing their form.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0010">The present invention is directed, in some of its several aspects, to a method and a module for use in a modular assembly for retaining or detaining storm water beneath a ground surface.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">In one embodiment of the invention, a module comprises a substantially horizontally disposed deck portion and at least one substantially vertically disposed side portion extending therefrom. The deck portion and side portion have respective end edges, and the side portion has bottom edges. The side portion and the deck portion define a longitudinal channel which is open at least at one end of the module. The side portion has at least one opening therein which defines a lateral channel in the module. The longitudinal and lateral channels are in fluid communication with one another. Preferably, each channel has about the same cross section and extends upwardly from the bottom edges to allow relatively unconstrained fluid flow in the longitudinal and lateral directions.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">The preferred module according to the present invention may be disposed in a single depth or level configuration, although other configurations are also possible and will be discussed. The module may be in the form of an inverted elongated U-shaped module or an inverted L-shaped module. A support member may be utilized in connection with the L-shaped modules to provide support to the assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">A plurality of modules may be assembled in any plan area configuration. The plurality of modules may define interior modules and side modules placed peripherally of the interior modules. Preferably, the modules are laterally and longitudinally aligned to form continuous channels which allow relatively unconstrained water flow within the assembly. One or more inlet ports allow influent into the assembly. If necessary, outlet ports, a perforated floor or a combination of both provide for fluid flow out of the assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In another aspect of the invention, the modules may be assembled so that at least some of the modules are rotated relative to others. In one aspect, the modules may be assembled into a double depth configuration where the U-shaped modules are placed within the ground in an upright manner with the deck portion forming a floor to the assembly. Inverted U-shaped modules may then be placed in vertical alignment above the inverted modules. This assembly forms upper and lower levels of modules with each level of modules having longitudinally and laterally aligned channels. The lower modules are preferably rotated 180° relative to the upper modules so that one level of modules is inverted relative to the other level.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">A method of retaining or detaining storm water includes the steps of connecting the longitudinal and lateral channels such that the channels are aligned and in fluid communication with one another and placing an outer boundary around the channels.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0044">The present invention generally provides a module for an underground assembly for storm water retention as well as storm water detention. In one aspect of the invention, these modules provide great versatility in the configuration of a modular assembly. The modules may be assembled in any customized orientation to suit any plan area or footprint as desired by the particular application involved and its side boundaries. The modular assembly may be configured to avoid existing underground obstructions such as utilities, pipelines, storage tanks, wells, and any other formations as desired. The modules for use in the present invention are sold by Utility Concrete Products, LLC of Plainfield, Ill. or by its related company, StormTrap LLC of Morris, Ill., under the trademark StormTrap™.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">The modules are positioned in the ground at any desired depth. For example, the topmost portion of the modules may be positioned so as to form a traffic surface such as, for example, a parking lot, airport runway or tarmac. Alternatively, the modules may be positioned within the ground underneath one or more earth layers. In either case, the modules are sufficient to withstand earth, wheel, or object loads. The modules are suitable for numerous applications, and, by way of example but not limitation, may be located under lawns, parkways, parking lots, roadways, airports, railroads, or building floor areas. So it can be seen that the preferred modules give ample versatility for virtually any application while still permitting storm water retention or detention.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">In another aspect of the invention, the module permits storm water to be stored within its interior volume which is defined by longitudinal and lateral channels that will be described in detail below. The channels are generally defined by a deck portion and at least one side portion. Both the longitudinal and lateral channels extend upwardly from the bottom edge of the module so as to allow relatively unconstrained storm water flow in both the longitudinal and lateral directions of the modules of the preferred embodiment. Preferably, these channels occupy a relatively large proportion of the area of the module. The module design permits a large amount of internal storm water storage while minimizing the excavation required during site installation and minimizing the plan area or footprint occupied by each module.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">In addition, the modules may be further configured either in a single level or single depth, or alternatively, they may be configured in what is called a double depth whereby at least two modules are combined, preferably in vertical alignment relative to each other. In a double depth configuration, a lower module preferably has an upright U-shape so that the deck portion now forms a floor. An upper module which preferably has an inverted U-shape is stacked upright on the lower module. In other words, one of the upper and lower modules is preferably inverted approximately 180° relative to the other of the upper and lower modules. The side portions of the upper module are vertically aligned with the side portions of the lower module. The individual longitudinal and lateral channels formed by each of the upper and lower modules thereafter form portions of larger channels which have an increased depth. So it can be seen therefore that the double depth configuration further increases the interior volume of the assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Assembly inlet ports permit storm water into the modules from areas outside of the assembly such as, for example, water accumulating at the ground level or other water storage areas located either at ground level or other levels. These inlet ports can be located at any elevation in order to permit fluid communication with existing storm water drains and conduits. The water can either be stored within the assembly or be permitted to exit the assembly using one or more passageways. Assembly outlet ports may be used to direct the storm water to one or more of the following offsite locations: a waterway, water treatment plants, another municipal treatment facility or other locations which are capable of receiving storm water. Another way that storm water may exit the assembly is through the process of water percolation through a perforate assembly floor. Other ways will be apparent to one skilled in the art.</p>
  <p num="p-0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a first embodiment of an underground assembly for storm water retention and/or detention. The assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is composed of a plurality of modules, such as interior modules, generally indicated at <b>1</b>, and perimeter or side modules, generally indicated at <b>2</b>. Each module will be described in more detail below. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> assemblies of modules are preferably placed in side-by-side and end-to-end configuration beneath a ground surface although the modules may also be spaced apart, as described below. Joints <b>3</b> between the modules are typically sealed with a sealant or tape such as, for example, bitmastic tape, wraps, filter fabric or the like. The length or width of the assembly of modules forming the channel is unlimited and may form irregular shapes such as the assembly illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which will also be described in detail.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the modules are preferably placed on footings or pads <b>4</b> which are positioned in a parallel and spaced orientation. The footings <b>4</b> may be precast or formed in-situ and are preferably made of concrete. The gap between the footings is preferably filled with aggregate material or filter fabric material <b>5</b> allowing all or a portion of the storm water to be absorbed by the soil. The aggregate or fabric material <b>5</b> is preferably placed between the footings <b>4</b> and extends approximately to the top surface of the footings so that it forms a flat layer for the channel bottom surfaces. The aggregate material may comprise any conventional material having a suitable particle size which allows the storm water to percolate into the earth layers beneath the assembly at whatever flow rate is desired. Various filter fabrics may also be used. Alternatively, the area between the footings may be filled with continuous in-situ concrete or a membrane forming a floor. The floor may be impervious except for an assembly outlet port, which will be described below.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the assembled modules are covered with compacted soil <b>6</b> and/or road materials <b>7</b> to support a non-traffic area, traffic area, building floor or other areas. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> generally illustrates a single depth configuration. Inflow of storm water to the assembly illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may occur via one or multiple assembly inlet ports <b>8</b>. Each port is fluidly connected to a ground level drain and its associated conduit. While the inlet ports <b>8</b> are shown in the given orientation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, these inlet ports are not limited to particular locations. Rather, they may be specifically customized as required by the preferred site requirements to allow for the direct inlet of the storm water into the assembly. For example, the location of these ports may be preformed during the formation of the module if the preferred location is known, or, on the other hand, the ports may be formed during installation using appropriate tools.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">Another inflow source that may be used, either alone or in combination with the inlet ports, are one or more side inlet ports <b>9</b>. These may be placed in customized locations and elevations in the perimeter walls to receive storm water via pipes <b>10</b> from remote locations of the site. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one side inlet port <b>9</b>, but multiple such ports may be provided. Assembly outlet ports <b>11</b> may be placed in various locations and at various elevations in the perimeter walls of the channel for outlets of the storm water. By way of example, but not limitation, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one outlet port <b>11</b> preferably is used and is sized generally smaller than the inlet ports to restrict the flow of storm water exiting the assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0053"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref> illustrate a first embodiment of a module and, in particular, show the interior module <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in greater detail. The interior module <b>1</b> includes a substantially horizontally disposed deck portion <b>12</b> located overhead (in this figure) and two substantially vertically disposed side portions <b>13</b>. The side portions <b>13</b> extend downwardly from longitudinal side edges <b>13</b>A of the deck portion <b>12</b> and provide support to the deck portion. The side portion <b>13</b> includes bottom edges <b>13</b>B which preferably rest on the footing <b>4</b> at the bottom of the assembly. Although not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the gap between the footings <b>4</b> is preferably filled with an aggregate material <b>5</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which extends to the top surface of the footings. Instead of footings, the bottom edges <b>13</b>B of the side portion <b>13</b> may rest on a floor which extends between the bottom edges. The floor may be imperforate, or it may have one or more openings, as later shown and described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in order to allow controlled access of storm water out of the module.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">The preferred module has a longitudinal channel and at least one lateral channel. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, in the interior module <b>1</b>, the deck portion <b>12</b> and the side portions <b>13</b> define a longitudinal channel <b>13</b>C which is open at the ends of the module. The longitudinal channel extends upwardly from the bottom edges <b>13</b>B of the side portions <b>13</b>. The longitudinal channel <b>13</b>C extends in the longitudinal direction of the module to permit storm water flow in that direction. In the embodiment illustrated, each side portion <b>13</b> has two openings which are disposed in a side-by-side orientation, and these openings define two lateral channels <b>13</b>D. The lateral channels <b>13</b>D also extend upwardly from the bottom edges <b>13</b>B and permit storm water flow in a lateral direction of the module.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Both the longitudinal channel <b>13</b>C and the lateral channels <b>13</b>D are in fluid communication with one another so as to permit storm water flow in the longitudinal and lateral directions. It is noted that the flow between the longitudinal and lateral channel occurs relatively unconstrained within the module due to the size and location of the channels. Each of the channels extends to the bottom edge <b>13</b>B of the side portion <b>13</b> and thus to the bottom surface or floor of the module. As best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the channel bottom surfaces for both the longitudinal channel and the lateral channels are formed by the footings <b>4</b> and the aggregate material <b>5</b>. So even very low water levels are permitted to flow between channels.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Both longitudinal and lateral channels are quite large so as to allow such unrestricted flow. They range in height from approximately one foot to five feet or more. The channel sizes also prevent clogging due to roadside debris which may enter the modules. While it is preferred that the longitudinal and lateral channels have approximately the same cross-sectional size, other configurations are also possible. The preferred configuration of the longitudinal channel is for it to occupy substantially all of the end of the module. Similarly, it is preferred that the lateral channels occupy substantially all of the total area of the sides of the module, and this may be in form of one or more lateral openings. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the preferred shape of the longitudinal and lateral channels forms an inverted U-shape although other shapes are also possible.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the overall configuration of the module <b>1</b> has an inverted U-shape which is elongated in the longitudinal direction. The length L of each module may range between two feet and twenty feet or more and is preferably about fourteen feet. The span or width W of each module may be two feet to ten feet or more and is preferably about seven feet. So it can be seen that the opposing interior surfaces of the side portions <b>13</b> generally define a span which is less than the length of the deck portion and side portions. The thickness T of the deck portion and side portions is in the range of six inches to twelve inches or more. By way of example, but not limitation, a thickness of eight inches has been found suitable for widths of six feet. The height of the module has an approximate range of two feet to twelve feet, and is preferably about five or six feet. It is preferred that the longitudinal and lateral channels have approximately the same cross-sectional size. The height of the channels ranges approximately between one foot to five feet. The width of the channels can range approximately between one foot and ten feet, preferably approximately between four feet and seven feet, and with the preferred width ranging approximately between five feet and six feet.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a second embodiment of a module is illustrated in the form of a side module <b>2</b>, which was previously identified in the assembly <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The side module <b>2</b> is disposed peripherally of the interior module <b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and has some of the same parts such that the same numbers will be used to designate like parts. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the side module <b>2</b> includes a corresponding substantially horizontally disposed deck portion <b>12</b> and two substantially vertically disposed side portions <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> which extend from opposite longitudinal sides <b>13</b>A of the side module deck portion. The side portions <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> are preferably integrally connected to the deck portion. Together, the deck portion and side portions define a corresponding longitudinal channel <b>13</b>E. The side portion <b>13</b> includes openings defined therein which defines lateral channels <b>13</b>F, while another side portion <b>14</b> is without openings. The longitudinal and lateral channels <b>13</b>E, <b>13</b>F of the module <b>2</b> fluidly communicate with one another to allow relatively unconstrained fluid flow in the longitudinal and lateral directions in a similar manner as described for the module <b>1</b>. The construction and dimension of the side module is preferably the same as that described for the interior module <b>1</b> although other modifications are possible and will be discussed below. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, while the side portion <b>14</b> is shown as a substantially vertical wall which is imperforate, it is also possible for the side portion <b>14</b> to include one or more assembly inlet or outlet ports as necessary in order to allow inflow and outflow of storm water as well as other fluids.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in addition to the side modules <b>2</b>, other embodiments of modules are also possible at the periphery of the assembly. A third embodiment includes rear corner modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B. A fourth embodiment includes front corner modules <b>15</b>C, one front corner module being shown by way of example. Each corner module <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B, <b>15</b>C has a substantially vertical wall extending from the deck portion at one of the front or rear longitudinal ends of the deck portion. The vertical wall defines an outer boundary of the assembly. In this way, the modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B, <b>15</b>C have one closed longitudinal end and one closed lateral side which intersect one another at one of the corners of the module. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the corner modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B, <b>15</b>C are preferably placed at the front and rear corner locations of the assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">The dimensions of the corner modules may be similar to those described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> although the actual dimensions will vary on the requirements of the plan site. For example, in the assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the front corner module <b>15</b>C has dimension similar to module <b>1</b> or module <b>2</b>. The rear corner modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B have a shorter length due to the preferred plan area of the parking lot under which the assembly is placed. The rear corner modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B have a length approximate to half of the length of the modules <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> or a length which defines one of the lateral channels (not shown) that was previously shown and described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Each rear corner module <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B preferably defines one longitudinal channel and one lateral channel, similar to those channels previously described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, to allow relatively unconstrained fluid flow between the channels.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fifth embodiment of a module is illustrated in the form of front end modules <b>15</b>D which are placed between the front corner modules, only one front corner module <b>15</b>C being shown. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each end module <b>15</b>D defines one longitudinal channel along its length and two lateral channels defined by its two side portions, similar to the previously described module <b>1</b>, except that the front end module <b>15</b>D further has a substantially vertically disposed end wall <b>14</b>A which is preferably used to define an assembly outer boundary.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a sixth embodiment of a module shows rear end modules <b>15</b>E extending between the rear corner modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B. The rear end modules <b>15</b>E preferably have a similar length to the rear corner modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B and define one longitudinal channel and one lateral channel (not shown). It will be understood that a substantially vertical end wall (not shown) extends from one longitudinal end of the deck portion in a similar manner as shown for the front end modules <b>15</b>D so as to define an outer boundary for the assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">Turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the side portions and deck portion of the module are preferably formed as one integral piece. The module <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the module <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the other side, end and corner modules are preferably made of precast concrete having a high strength. Preferably, the modules are formed with embedded reinforcements <b>16</b> which may be steel reinforcing rods, prefabricated steel mesh or other similar reinforcements. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a grid of reinforcements <b>16</b> such as crossing steel reinforcing rods or prefabricated steel mesh is embedded within deck and side portions of the module <b>1</b>. The requirements for the size and location of such reinforcement are well known in the trade. The reinforcement is customarily designed by a licensed structural engineer who designs the reinforcement to work with the concrete to provide sufficient load carrying strength to support earth and/or traffic loads placed upon the modules. In place of the reinforcing bars or mesh, other forms of reinforcement may be used such as pre-tensioned or post-tensioned steel strands or metal or plastic fibers or ribbons. Alternatively, the modules may be comprised of hollow core material which is a precast, prestressed concrete having reinforcing, prestressed strands. Hollow core material has a number of continuous voids along its length and is well known in the industry for its strength. Where the modules are located at or beneath a traffic surface such as, for example, a parking lot, street, highway, other roadways or airport traffic surfaces, the module construction will meet American Association of State Transportation and Highway Officials (AASTHO) standards. Preferably, the construction will be sufficient to withstand an HS20 loading, a known load standard in the industry, although other load standards may also be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0064"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>a </i>illustrates a modified module <b>2</b>A which is similar to the module <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which like parts shown with like number, except that the module <b>2</b>A includes a floor F which extends between the bottom edges <b>13</b>B of the side portions <b>13</b>. The floor may be integrally formed with the side portions <b>13</b> and may be perforate or imperforate, as desired by the site requirements. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>a </i>the longitudinal channel <b>13</b>C defined by the deck portion <b>12</b> and the side portions <b>13</b> extends upwardly from the bottom edges <b>13</b>B of the side portions <b>13</b>. The lateral channel <b>13</b>F likewise extends upwardly from the bottom edges <b>13</b>B. It is understood that both the longitudinal and lateral channels extends from the top surface of the floor F to allow flow in the longitudinal and lateral directions.</p>
  <p num="p-0065"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a series of interior modules <b>1</b>, which are similar to the module described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and placed in end-to-end series configuration. Each module has side portions <b>13</b> with side-by-side openings defining lateral channels <b>13</b>D. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the interior modules are placed so that the longitudinal ends of each channel are in alignment. The series of modules form a continuous longitudinal channel, which is made of the individual longitudinal channel <b>13</b>C (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of each of the modules <b>1</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the side portions <b>13</b> of each module include up to three legs <b>17</b> or more which support along the length of the deck. End legs E are preferably smaller and than intermediate legs M. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the intermediate legs are twice are wide as the end legs although other configurations are possible. The preferred cross-sectional dimensions of the leg are in the range of five inches by five inches to twenty-four inches by twenty-four inches with a cross sectional dimension of five inches by twelve to twenty-four inches found suitable for leg lengths up to twelve feet. By way of example, but not limitation, the end legs may be twelve inches wide by five inches thick and the intermediate legs M are typically twenty-four inches wide by five inches thick. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the legs are supported on top of a footing <b>4</b> although they may instead be supported by a floor, as previously described.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">Turning briefly back to the assembly of modules illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it will be seen that the modules may be arranged in what can be described as rows and columns. That is, one way of combining the modules is in a reticulated configuration. The series of interior modules <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is placed within the assembly in an end-to-end configuration to form what shall be referred to as columns. The columns are disposed along the longitudinal direction A of the assembly. A second column of interior modules is placed adjacent to the first column and is aligned (an in abutment) therewith to form an array of columns and rows. The rows are disposed along the lateral direction of the assembly. The adjacent lateral channels are aligned with each other. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of interior modules preferably are placed within the assembly to form several columns and rows in end-to-end and side-by-side configuration. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of continuous longitudinal channels are generally disposed in parallel with one another and intersect a plurality of continuous lateral channels which also are generally parallel with each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, side modules <b>2</b> are disposed at the periphery of the outermost interior modules. Preferably, the side modules are longitudinally and laterally aligned in relation to the interior modules so as to form a portion of the continuous longitudinal and lateral channels. Both interior and side modules provide a portion of the total storage volume of the assembly. Preferably, one would use side modules <b>2</b> to form two columns, one column at each outside location of the plurality of interior modules <b>1</b>, so as to define outer side boundaries to the assembly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each side module <b>2</b> provides a portion of a respective continuous longitudinal channel along the longitudinal direction A and provides a portion of (preferably) two continuous lateral channels which are disposed in the lateral direction B. The rear corner modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B and rear end modules <b>15</b>E provide an outer boundary at the rear end of the assembly. Each of these rear modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B, <b>15</b>E also forms a portion of a continuous longitudinal and lateral channel. Similarly, the front corner module <b>15</b>C and front end modules <b>15</b>D form portions of the continuous channels at the front boundary of the assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the continuous longitudinal and lateral channels provide for relatively unconstrained storm water flow between the modules in both the longitudinal direction A and the lateral direction B of the assembly. The side modules <b>2</b>, corner modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B, <b>15</b>C and end modules <b>15</b>D, <b>15</b>E provide an outer boundary to the assembly. As previously discussed, any one (or more) of the modules may permit controlled access to the assembly in the form of assembly inlet and outlet ports <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>. The inlet ports <b>8</b> may be defined in the interior modules <b>1</b>, in the side modules <b>2</b> or in combination thereof to permit influent into the assembly. The inlet and outlet ports may be customized into virtually unlimited locations and elevations as desired by the plan area requirements.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">Alternately, it is also possible to place adjacent columns in an offset or staggered orientation, such as, for example, an orientation commonly used for laying bricks, while still providing aligned lateral channels. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>a</i>, a second assembly embodiment illustrates such an orientation. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>a</i>, an interior module <b>1</b> is offset from corner modules <b>15</b>C, <b>15</b>F. The corner modules <b>15</b>C, <b>15</b>F together with end modules <b>15</b>E define an outer boundary. It will be realized that corner module <b>15</b>F is a mirror view of corner module <b>15</b>C along a longitudinal line of symmetry. Even though the ends of an individual interior modules are not aligned with both ends of a module in an adjacent column, but is offset therefrom, the longitudinal and lateral channels of each module are aligned to form continuous channels. For example, one lateral channel of the interior module <b>1</b> is aligned in a row with one lateral channel defined in each pair of laterally aligned corner modules <b>15</b>C, <b>15</b>F. Another lateral channel of the interior module <b>1</b> is aligned in a row with one lateral channel defined in each second pair of laterally aligned corner modules <b>15</b>C, <b>15</b>F. End modules <b>15</b>E are placed between each pair of corner modules and also form a portion of the continuous channels. The modular assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>a </i>is shown by way of example but not limitation, as other assembly configurations are possible and may depend on the plan area requirements.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the side module <b>2</b> is illustrated rotated 180° about a vertical axis relative to the view shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the side modules are required to support lateral loads that exceed the structural capacity of the cantilever beam configuration of the side modules, one or more integral structural braces <b>18</b> may be added. This variation is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a seventh embodiment of a module <b>19</b> is illustrated which is similar to the module of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with like parts shown with like numbers, except that this module <b>19</b> may be configured to include an upper traffic surface <b>20</b> to be used at grade level, illustratively. This offers the economics of additional pavement not being required in the area of the storm water retention/detention channel. To enhance the visual attractiveness of the upper traffic surface of the deck of the modules, the upper surface <b>20</b> may include architectural finishes which are either added to the top surface of the deck portion <b>12</b> or which may be embossed into the deck portion when it is manufactured using molds or other tooling. These embossed surfaces may include but not be limited to simulated brick in various patterns, simulated stone pavers, and graphic illustrations. Also actual brick or stone pavers or cut stone may be inset into the top surface of the deck portion as a further architectural enhancement. For example, each of the modules in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be provided with an upper surface <b>20</b> with the assembly being installed at an elevation which allows the upper surface of the assembly to form the traffic surface of the illustrated parking lot.</p>
  <p num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> illustrate another aspect of the invention that will be generally described herein as a double depth or double level configuration. When site specific inlet and outlet elevations allow increased depths up to 10 feet and more, the storm water detention and/or retention system may be assembled with two levels of modules disposed one above the other. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an arrangement of the modules which is similar to the view shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> except that it includes a plurality of lower modules <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B, <b>21</b>C, <b>21</b>D and a plurality of upper modules <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>C, <b>22</b>D.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">In particular, the layer of lower modules is comprised of interior modules <b>21</b>A and side modules <b>21</b>B which are similar to the interior modules <b>1</b> and side modules <b>2</b> already described relative to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> except that the lower modules are placed within the ground with their respective deck portions being at the bottom and the side portions extending upward therefrom. The lower modules are preferably rotated 180° along a horizontal axis relative to the orientation described for the single depth configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Corner modules <b>21</b>C are disposed at the lower corner modules of the assembly. End modules <b>21</b>D are disposed between the lower corner modules <b>21</b>C. Both the corner and end modules <b>21</b>C, <b>21</b>D are placed upright within the assembly. The layer of upper modules comprises interior modules <b>22</b>A, side modules <b>22</b>B, corner modules <b>22</b>C and end modules <b>22</b>D, similar to those described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and like numbers will be used to identify like parts. Each of the upper and lower modules includes longitudinal and lateral channels, as described relative to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the longitudinal channels are aligned along the longitudinal direction A, and the lateral channels are aligned along the lateral direction B of the assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each of the lower modules <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B, <b>21</b>C, <b>21</b>D preferably have a U-shape, and the upper modules <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>C, <b>22</b>D have an inverted U-shape. Each lower module includes a deck portion <b>24</b> which forms a portion of a floor of the assembly. The floor may be perforate or imperforate. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the assembly has some deck portions which have no openings, and other deck portions which have openings. For example, one or more of the deck portions <b>24</b> may have one or more openings <b>23</b> defined therein to permit fluid to exit the assembly through these openings. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> the opening <b>23</b> is shown spaced from the longitudinally disposed ends and laterally disposed sides of the modules although other orientations are also possible.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">Turning first to the lower interior modules <b>21</b>A, each lower interior module <b>21</b>A includes side portions <b>24</b>A which define two lateral channels, similar to those channels previously described for the single depth configuration, except that the side portions extend upwardly from each longitudinal side edge of the deck portion to define an upright U-shape. The side portions of the lower interior modules <b>21</b>A support corresponding side portions <b>13</b> of the upper interior modules <b>22</b>A.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">Each lower interior module further has at least one passageway <b>23</b>A which is formed in at least one of the side portions. The passageways <b>23</b>A extends upwardly from the deck portion <b>24</b>, and each one is preferably located below- and sized smaller than the corresponding lateral channel defined in the side portion. Although the passageway <b>23</b>A is shown as a separate opening than the lateral channels, it is also possible that the passageway <b>23</b>A may be formed as part of the lateral channel thus extending the lateral channel to the deck portion or floor of the assembly. By way of example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it can be seen that the lower interior modules <b>21</b>A have passageways <b>23</b>A formed in each side portion <b>24</b>A. The passageway <b>23</b>A of the module <b>21</b>A preferably is aligned with a corresponding passageway <b>23</b>A formed in an adjacent lower module <b>21</b>A. The passageways <b>23</b>A provide for unrestricted flow of the storm water between the lower modules. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, passageways <b>23</b>A are also defined in side modules <b>21</b>B, corner modules <b>21</b>C and end modules <b>21</b>D of the lower modules.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each of the lower side modules <b>21</b>B includes one side portion <b>24</b>B which defines two lateral channels and another side portion <b>24</b>C which provides a section of an outer boundary to the assembly. Some of the side portions <b>24</b>C are illustrated without openings or imperforate, and other side portions are illustrated as perforate with one or more inlet ports <b>9</b> or outlet ports <b>11</b> defined therein. As previously described relative to the single depth modular assembly, other combinations of inlets and outlets to the assembly are possible. Each of the lower corner modules <b>21</b>C and lower end modules <b>21</b>D also includes corresponding side portions, one side portion <b>24</b>D of the end module <b>21</b>D being shown by way of example and defining one lateral channel. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> when the upper and lower modules are combined, the individual longitudinal and lateral channels of the upper and lower modules are vertically aligned to define corresponding continuous longitudinal channels <b>24</b>E and corresponding continuous lateral channels <b>24</b>F. The upper modules are oriented in an inverted U-shaped with the side portions of the upper modules being supported on the side portions of the upright lower modules.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Placement of the double depth configuration preferably involves placing one or several adjacent lower modules in an excavated site and then placing the corresponding upper modules on top of the lower modules. These steps are preferably repeated until the entire assembly is completed, although other configurations are possible. For example, one or more rows or columns, or even all the lower modules in the entire reticulated assembly, may be placed in the site before placing the upper modules on top of their respective lower modules. If desired, the upper and lower modules may be secured or fastened to each other using any conventional methods. By way of example, but not limitation, the upper and lower modules may be secured by an interlocking structure where each bottom edge of their respective side portions has a beveled shape, as illustrated in the alternate embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref> <i>f</i>–<b>13</b> <i>h</i>. Other variations are also possible.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">The double depth configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has the advantage that the deck portion of the lower module provides a floor which assists in structurally supporting the assembly on the underlying soil relative to vertical loads applied to the assembly. Thus no secondary in-situ or precast concrete footings are necessary. The ranges of overall dimensions of each upper and lower module are similar to those previously described for the single depth module. The overall height dimension of the assembly is additive of the heights of both the upper and lower modules to provide a greater storm water storage capacity. The heights of the upper and lower module layers need not be the same and may vary in relation to each other. This double depth configuration includes all the features, advantages, and embodiments detailed for the single depth configuration.</p>
  <p num="p-0080"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> demonstrates a further embodiment of the modular assembly. The assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the versatility and easy connectability of the modules and how the modules can be assembled in configurations that are adaptable to a specific site's physical area constraints and underground obstacles such as plant root systems <b>25</b> or underground utilities <b>26</b>. Due to the modular design, the plan area is not constrained to simple rectangular shapes, but the modules may be combined in any free form plan area shape available within the constraints of the site. In accordance with features already described, the modules form corresponding longitudinal channels in the longitudinal direction A of the assembly and corresponding lateral channels in the lateral direction B.</p>
  <p num="p-0081"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an assembly configuration which includes a combination of lower interior modules (not shown), lower side modules <b>21</b>B, lower corner modules <b>21</b>C, lower end modules <b>21</b>D, upper interior modules <b>22</b>A, upper side modules <b>22</b>B, upper corner modules <b>22</b>C, and upper end modules <b>22</b>D. The assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> furthers includes lower double-sided modules <b>21</b>E having closed lateral side portions on both sides of the module. Upper double-side modules <b>22</b>E are supported by the lower modules <b>21</b>E in some areas, and, in other areas, a single depth module <b>22</b>F may be used without a supporting lower module. The single depth module <b>22</b>F preferably includes an imperforate floor to avoid interfering with the utilities <b>26</b> or other underground obstacles and is raised above the level of lower modules using earth or other fill materials. So it can be seen that the assembly may include both single and double depth configurations as is required by the specific site conditions. Illustratively, this assembly supports the loads associated with a parking lot and forms a traffic surface for the parking lot.</p>
  <p num="p-0082"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> <i>a </i>is a cross-sectional end view, similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which illustrates a group of interior modules <b>1</b> in another aspect of the invention. The interior modules <b>1</b> are laterally spaced apart from one another. A connecting portion <b>27</b> having two ends <b>27</b>A and <b>27</b>B is placed between the interior modules. The connecting portion is preferably made of a flat, precast concrete slab or hollow-core panel and has approximately the same thickness, width and length of the deck portion <b>12</b> of the module <b>1</b>. The connecting portion preferably is six feet wide and fourteen feet long although the connecting portion may have other lengths and widths. Other orientations of the connecting portion are also possible. By way of example but not limitation, the interior modules could be spaced further apart, and several connecting portions may be placed lengthwise between the modules.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> <i>a</i>, at least one side portion of each module has a longitudinally extending recess <b>28</b> to support one end of the connecting portion and transfer lateral loads. An intermediate longitudinal channel <b>28</b>A is defined between the side portions <b>13</b> of the spaced apart modules and the connecting portion <b>27</b>. This longitudinal channel <b>28</b>A extends upwardly from the bottom edge <b>13</b>B of the side portions and is in fluid communication with the lateral channels <b>13</b>D defined by the side portions <b>13</b>. Both the lateral and longitudinal channels allow for relatively unconstrained flow of storm water throughout the assembly. It is realized that the modules will be provided with an imperforate or perforate floor which is relatively level with the top elevation of the footings <b>4</b> so that the channels extend completely to the floor of the modules.</p>
  <p num="p-0084"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> <i>b </i>shows a modified configuration of spaced apart modules where each of the modules includes a longitudinally extending ledge <b>29</b>. The ledge <b>29</b> is spaced from the top surface of the deck portion at distance which is approximate to the thickness of the connecting portion <b>27</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> <i>c</i>, a modified connecting portion <b>30</b> has a lower surface which includes longitudinal located depressions <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B located adjacent the respective longitudinal ends <b>27</b>A, <b>27</b>B of the connecting portion. An upper surface of the connecting portion <b>30</b> is slightly elevated relative to the deck portions <b>12</b> of the modules. The depressions <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B facilitate the transfer of lateral loads to the assembly. The spaced apart configuration of modules with a connecting portion spanning between the modules may be utilized with any of the aspects discussed herein. Other locations for the depressions may be utilized where, for example, a different orientation is desired for the connecting portion <b>30</b> relative to the modules.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">In another aspect of the invention, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b </i>illustrate an eighth embodiment of a module. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b </i>show a module <b>31</b> which has a substantially horizontally disposed deck portion <b>31</b>A and one substantially vertically disposed side portion <b>31</b>B, which are like those previously described relative to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, except that the module <b>31</b> has one side portion. The side portion <b>31</b>B extends integrally from one longitudinally disposed side of the deck portion opposite a longitudinally disposed free side <b>31</b>C. The module <b>31</b> has an inverted L-shape which is elongated in the longitudinal direction. The module <b>31</b> has overall dimensions similar to those previously described and is also supported by a footing <b>4</b> or a floor and aggregate material <b>5</b> (not shown). A first longitudinal channel <b>31</b>D is formed by the interior surfaces of the deck portion <b>31</b>A and side portion <b>31</b>B of the L-shaped module <b>31</b> and extends upwardly from the bottom edges <b>31</b>E. Lateral channels <b>13</b>F are formed in the side portion <b>31</b>B preferably in a side-by-side parallel orientation. The first longitudinal channel <b>31</b>D fluidly communicates with the lateral channels <b>31</b>F.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">The configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b </i>further includes a support module <b>32</b> which supports the free side <b>31</b>C of the inverted L-shaped module <b>31</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b</i>, the support module <b>32</b> preferably has an inverted U-shape similar to the module <b>2</b> described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, a variety of support members rather than the illustrated support module may be used to provide a support to the module <b>31</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> <i>a</i>, the support module <b>32</b> includes a corresponding horizontally disposed deck portion <b>32</b>A, two corresponding side portions <b>32</b>B, <b>32</b>C, and corresponding bottom edges <b>32</b>E. The support module <b>32</b> further defines corresponding longitudinal and lateral channels <b>32</b>D, <b>32</b>F, respectively. A longitudinally extending recess <b>32</b>G is formed in the support module <b>32</b> at a location where the side portion <b>32</b>B extends from the deck portion <b>32</b>A.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b</i>, the free side <b>31</b>C of the inverted L-shaped module <b>31</b> is received within the longitudinally extending recess <b>32</b>G of the support module <b>32</b>. In addition to the first longitudinal channel <b>31</b>D already defined by the module <b>31</b>, the longitudinal channel <b>32</b>D formed by the support module <b>32</b> forms a second longitudinal channel. The lateral channels <b>32</b>F of the support module <b>32</b> permit fluid communication between the first and second longitudinal channels <b>31</b>D, <b>32</b>D. The other side portion <b>32</b>C of the support module <b>32</b> defines an outer boundary to the assembly and may either be imperforate, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or define one or more assembly access inlet or outlet ports, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b</i>, the configuration may include two or more modules <b>31</b>.

The lateral channels <b>31</b>F permit fluid communication between the longitudinal channels <b>31</b>D of adjacent modules <b>31</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">Relative to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a</i>–<b>11</b> <i>c</i>, any number of modules <b>31</b> may be laid side-by-side in a row of any length as determined by the site requirements. Other rows may be placed adjacent to the rows illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>c </i>thus forming columns and rows which are aligned longitudinally and laterally. Preferably, the outermost inverted L-shaped module is formed with a side portion which is either imperforate or has one or more assembly access ports to define an outer boundary.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">Numerous variations are possible using the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b</i>. For example, where the site requirements desire that the row of modules include only one inverted L-shaped module <b>31</b> and one support module <b>32</b>, then the side portion <b>31</b>B of the module <b>31</b> preferably defines an assembly boundary. Alternatively, where the row is formed from a plurality of inverted L-shaped modules <b>31</b> placed in series, each module <b>31</b> defines at least one lateral channel <b>31</b>F for fluid communication between adjacent longitudinal channels, except that the outermost module (not shown) located at the periphery of the assembly which has a side portion that is formed without a lateral channel.</p>

  <p num="p-0101">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> <i>f</i>, a support module, generally indicated at <b>50</b> and comprised of upper and lower modules <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, supports a free end <b>48</b>C of the deck portion <b>48</b>A in a longitudinal recess <b>52</b>G.

As noted previously, each upper side portion has a beveled bottom edge, as shown, which fits with a mating beveled edge of a corresponding lower side portion when the upper and lower modules are placed in vertical alignment with one another. The interior surfaces of the deck portion and side portions of both upper and lower modules <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> define a second longitudinal channel <b>60</b>. The side portions <b>52</b>B, <b>54</b>B of the upper and lower modules <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> together define two lateral channels <b>62</b> disposed in a side-by-side orientation.

The lateral channels <b>62</b> of the upper and lower modules <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are aligned with the first named lateral channels <b>48</b>F of the Z-shaped module <b>48</b> to provide fluid communication between the second longitudinal channel <b>60</b> and the first named longitudinal channel <b>48</b>D.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> <i>f</i>, a substantially horizontal platform <b>63</b> is positioned between the side portion <b>54</b>B of the lower module <b>54</b> and the side portion <b>48</b>B of the Z-shaped module <b>48</b>.

  <p num="p-0105">It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that a method and apparatus are provided for retaining or detaining storm water beneath a ground surface. In various aspects, one practices the method preferably by connecting a plurality of longitudinal channels and connecting a plurality of lateral channels. The longitudinal channels preferably are each defined by at least one substantially horizontal deck and at least one substantially vertical side wall. The lateral channels are each defined preferably by a portion of a corresponding deck and a portion of a corresponding side wall. Preferably, both the longitudinal and lateral channels have relatively the same cross-section and are in longitudinal and lateral alignment to form continuous longitudinal and lateral channels. The respective longitudinal and lateral channels are preferably adjacent one another although they may be disposed in other configurations as desired by the existing or planned underground obstacles. Preferably, the side wall has a bottom edge, and both the channels extend upwardly from a corresponding bottom edge of the side wall to allow relatively unconstrained water flow in the longitudinal and lateral directions.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">The method further includes creating an outer boundary for the longitudinal and lateral channels and placing the peripheral walls around the channels. Portions of the peripheral walls include an assembly access port such as inlet or outlet ports to receive storm water within the assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">In one aspect, the method includes connecting longitudinal and lateral channels which are defined by at least one interior module having a corresponding deck portion and at least one side portion. For example, the assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes connecting a plurality of interior modules <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which are placed within an excavation site. The step of connecting preferably includes aligning the ends of adjacent modules so that the individual longitudinal channels <b>13</b>C of each interior module form a continuous longitudinal channel through the entire assembly. Preferably, the step of connecting further includes aligning the sides of adjacent modules so that the individual lateral channels <b>13</b>D of each interior module form a continuous lateral channel through the entire assembly. Side modules <b>2</b>, corner modules <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B, <b>15</b>C and end modules <b>15</b>D, <b>15</b>E are placed peripherally around the interior modules in an aligned configuration so that their corresponding longitudinal and lateral channels form a portion of the continuous channels. The vertical walls of the side, corner and end modules are located at the periphery of the assembly and have either an imperforate or perforate surface and may define inlet and outlet ports.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">After the particular site has been excavated and the underground obstructions accounted for, a first module is placed into the ground. The first module may be any one of an interior module, a side module, a corner module or an end module. Adjacent modules may be placed in longitudinal and lateral alignment with the first modules to form continuous longitudinal and lateral channels. Interior modules are placed towards the interior of the assembly while side modules, corner modules and end modules are placed at the periphery of the assembly. So it can be seen that the modules may be placed in any order within the ground to connect the channels.</p>
  <p num="p-0109">Although each module in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown as placed in end-to-end, side-by-side and adjacent alignment, it is also possible to place the modules in a spaced apart configuration with connecting portions spanning between the spaced apart modules. The assembly access inlet and outlet ports can be located in predetermined locations or formed in the side portions during installation in order to ensure that the inlet and outlet ports are aligned with existing underground drains and conduits. Alternatively, an outlet port may not be required where the floor of the assembly is perforate such as, for example, where the floor includes one or more openings or is formed of a porous or aggregate material which allows for percolation of the storm water into the ground.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">Storm water flows into the assembly through one or more of the inlet ports, is stored for a certain interval of time and then flows out of the assembly either through one or more outlet ports, through a porous or perforate floor, or a combination of both. During entry and storage of the storm water within the assembly, the laterally and longitudinal aligned channels allow relatively unconstrained water flow in the lateral and longitudinal directions. The assembly may be sloped such that the portion of the assembly having an inlet port is located at a slightly higher elevation while the portion of the assembly having an outlet port has a lower elevation to ensure that the storm water flows under the influence of gravity.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">In another aspect of the invention, the method may comprise the step of placing a support module beneath the ground surface prior to the steps of connecting the longitudinal and lateral channels. For example, the L-shaped modules of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref> <i>a</i>–<b>11</b> <i>b </i>preferably require the support module <b>32</b> to be placed in the ground to facilitate placement of the L-shaped modules <b>31</b>. Thereafter, one or more L-shaped modules are placed in the ground and longitudinal and lateral channels defined by the modules are connected to one another. The final L-shaped module which defines a peripheral wall of the assembly is then placed within the ground to define an outer boundary to the assembly. Similar steps may be used to assemble the configurations shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref> <i>a</i>–<b>13</b> <i>h </i>although the assemblies of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref> <i>f</i>–<b>13</b> <i>h </i>further include the step of placing a platform <b>63</b> prior to the steps of connecting the longitudinal and lateral channels.</p>
  <p num="p-0112">In a yet further aspect of the invention, the method may include the step of installing a plurality of U-shaped modules within the ground in an upright configuration at a predetermined depth. Lateral and longitudinal aligning corresponding ends and sides of the modules fluidly connect the channels defined by the modules. This method may include placing a top deck <b>40</b> over the upright modules, as shown in either the side-by-side configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> <i>a </i>or the spaced apart configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> <i>b</i>. Alternatively, the upright U-shaped modules form a first or lower level of modules which supports a second or upper level of inverted U-shaped modules placed upright on top of the lower level in vertical alignment.</p>
