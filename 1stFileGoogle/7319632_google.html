<heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field</p>
  <p num="p-0003">The disclosed embodiments relate generally to pseudo-dual port memories.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">2. Background</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Dual port memories typically have two ports and an array of memory cells. The memory array can be simultaneously accessed from both of the ports provided that the memory cells being accessed from one port are not the same memory cells that are being accessed from the other port. A common type of memory cell used in such dual port memories involves eight field effect transistors (FETs). Four of the transistors are interconnected to form two cross-coupled inverters. A first data node D of the memory cell is the node at the output lead of a first of the inverters and the input lead of the second of the inverters. A second data node DN of the memory cell is the node at the output lead of the second of the inverters and the input lead of the first of the inverters. There are two access transistors coupled to the first data node D. The first access transistor is provided so that a first bit line B<b>1</b> can selectively be coupled to the first data node D. The second access transistor is provided so that a second bit line B<b>2</b> can selectively be coupled to the first data node D. Similarly, there are two access transistors coupled to the second data node DN. The first access transistor is provided so that a first bit line bar B<b>1</b>N can be coupled to the second node DN. The second access transistor is provided so that a second bit line bar B<b>2</b>N can be coupled to the second node DN. The first bit line B<b>1</b> and first bit line bar B<b>1</b>N constitute a bit line pair and a for coupling an addressed memory cell to a first of the two ports of the dual port memory. The second bit line B<b>2</b> and second bit line bar B<b>2</b>N constitute a bit line pair and are for coupling an addressed memory cell to a second of the two ports of the dual port memory.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">The memory cells in a single port memory typically only include six transistors. As in the case of the eight-transistor cell, four of the transistors form a cross-coupled inverter structure. Rather than there being two pairs of access transistors as in the eight transistor cell, however, the six transistor cell has only one pair of access transistors. A first access transistor is provided for selectively coupling the first data node D of the cross-coupled inverters to a bit line B. A second access transistor is provided for coupling a second data node DN of the cross-coupled inverters to a bit line bar BN. The six-transistor memory cell typically consumes only about half as much integrated circuit area than the eight-transistor cell when the two types of memory cells are fabricated using the same process.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">In order to take advantage of the smaller size of the six-transistor memory cell, a memory device called a pseudo-dual port memory is often used. In one example, a pseudo-dual port memory has a single memory array where each memory cell of the array is a six-transistor memory cell that can be selectively coupled to a single pair of bit lines (for example, bit line B and bit line bar BN). The memory array operates as a single port memory in that only one memory access is performed at one time.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">The pseudo-dual port memory, however, mimics a dual port memory in that it has two ports. In one example, the pseudo-dual port memory has circuitry sometimes called a Time Delayed Multiplexer (TDM). A single input clock signal is received onto the pseudo-dual port memory and this single input clock signal is used to latch an input read address, an input write address, and an input data value. The rising edge of the input clock signal is used to initiate a read operation using the input read address. The read operation is completed. Thereafter, the falling edge of the input clock signal occurs. The TDM uses the falling edge of the input clock signal to initiate a write operation. The input write address is used to address the memory array during the write operation and the data written into the memory array is the input data value. Although two memory operations are performed in a single cycle of the input clock signal, the two memory operations are in reality performed one after the other. From outside the pseudo-dual port memory, however, the pseudo-dual port memory appears to allow two accesses of the memory array at the same time or substantially at the same time.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">The inventor has recognized that the amount of time required to perform the first read memory operation may not be equal to the amount of time required to perform the second write memory operation. Using a conventional TDM approach slows overall memory access times because the relative amounts of time available for the two operations is determined by the time when the rising edge of the clock cycle occurs and the time when the falling edge of the clock cycle occurs. If, for example, the clock signal is low for as long as it is high in a clock cycle (i.e., the clock signal has a 50/50 duty cycle), then the same amount of time must be allowed for performing both the faster read operation and the slower write operation. The result is an amount of wasted time that starts after the read operation has been completed and ends upon the falling edge of the clock signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Not only does the conventional TDM approach sometimes slow overall memory access times in situations where the relative amounts of time required to perform the two memory access does not match the duty cycle of the clock signal, but the conventional TDM approach also can cause overall memory access times to be slower than they otherwise would have to be due to the use of the falling edge of the clock signal to initiate operations. There may be jitter in the duty cycle of the clock signal such that the timing of the falling edge of the clock signal changes from clock cycle to clock cycle. If the circuitry is optimized for operation under one clock signal duty cycle condition, then it typically is not optimized for operation under another clock signal duty cycle condition. A time margin is typically built into the circuitry so that the circuitry of the pseudo-dual port memory will operate correctly under all clock signal duty cycle conditions. This time margin translates into wasted time under certain operating conditions where the time margin is not required for proper operation. The maximum clock frequency of the pseudo-dual port memory is therefore specified to be lower than it could be were there no such time margin.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Whereas the pseudo-dual port memory described above has a single input clock signal, it would be desirable in some applications for a pseudo-dual port memory to have a first port that was clocked with a first input clock signal and a second port that was clocked with a second input clock signal. By providing two separate input clocks, the use of one port could be made largely independent of the use of the other port. By making the two ports more independent, use of the pseudo-dual port memory could be simplified.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">In view of the above, an improved pseudo-dual port memory is desired that does not use both the rising and falling edges of the same input clock signal to control the ordering of two memory operations that also has two separate ports where each port has its own input clock.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY INFORMATION</heading> <p num="p-0013">A pseudo-dual port memory has a first port, a second port, and an array of six-transistor memory cells. The first port (for example, a read only port) includes a clock input lead for receiving a first clock signal. The second port (for example, a write only port) includes a clock input lead for receiving a second clock signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">A first memory access (for example, a read memory access operation) of the array is initiated by a rising edge of a first clock signal received onto the clock input lead of the first port. A second memory access (for example, a write memory access operation) of the array is initiated in response to a rising edge of a second clock signal received onto the clock input lead of the second port. If the rising edge of the second clock signal occurs within a first period of time (for example, when the first clock signal transitions high or during the following amount of time that the first clock signal is high), then the second memory access is initiated substantially immediately following completion of the first memory access. If, on the other hand, the rising edge of the second clock signal occurs later within a second period of time (for example, during the later period of time when the first clock signal is low), then initiation of the second memory access does not immediately follow completion of the first memory access but rather is delayed until after a second rising edge of the first clock signal. Where the second rising edge of the first clock signal initiates a third memory access operation through the first port, the second memory access operation occurs after the third memory access operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">One example of circuitry that detects when the rising edge of the second clock signal occurs relative to the first clock signal and that causes initiation of the second memory access to be delayed, if such delay is appropriate, is described in the detailed description section below. The circuitry involves a time delayed multiplexer that receives a read clock signal for the first memory access (a read operation) and a write clock signal for the second memory access (a write operation). The time delayed multiplexer outputs a control signal that determines whether the array of memory cells is addressed for the first memory access or is addressed for the second memory access. The circuitry further includes a write clock suppressor circuit. If the rising edge of the second clock signal occurs too late (when the first clock signal is low) for the time delayed multiplexer to work properly in initiating the second memory access operation immediately following the already initiated first memory access operation, then the write clock suppressor circuit suppresses the write clock signal supplied to the time delayed multiplexer, thereby delaying initiation of the second memory access operation until after the second rising edge of the first clock signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">In contrast to a conventional pseudo-dual port memory where the falling edge of an input clock is used to time when a second memory access starts, the durations of the first and second memory accesses in the novel pseudo-dual port memory disclosed in this patent document do not depend on when the falling edge of a clock signal occurs. Rather, the duration of the first memory access is largely dependent upon a propagation delay (for example, the delay introduced by a one shot circuit). The duration of the second memory access is largely dependent upon a propagation delay (for example, a propagation delay through random logic and/or the delay introduced by the one shot circuit). The ratio of the amount of time allotted to the first memory access versus the amount of time allotted to the second memory access can be adjusted during the design phase of the pseudo-dual port memory by adjusting the ratios and magnitudes of the propagation delays. The ratio of the amount of time allotted to the first memory access versus the amount of time allotted to the second memory access is substantially independent of the duty cycle of either the first clock signal or the second clock signal.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a high-level block diagram of a pseudo-dual port memory device <b>1</b> in accordance with one embodiment. Memory device <b>1</b> includes an array <b>2</b> of static random access memory cells. In the illustrated example, array <b>2</b> includes two rows of memory cells, where each row includes sixteen memory cells. In addition to array <b>2</b>, memory device <b>1</b> includes a set of eight column multiplexer/demultiplexers <b>3</b>-<b>10</b>. Only the first and eighth column multiplexer/demultiplexers <b>3</b> and <b>10</b> are illustrated. Memory device <b>1</b> also includes an address input latch, read/write multiplexer, and data input latch circuit <b>11</b>, a read clock generator circuit <b>12</b>, a write clock generator circuit <b>13</b>, a time delayed multiplexer circuit <b>14</b>, a one shot circuit <b>15</b>, and a write clock suppressor circuit <b>16</b>. Write clock suppressor circuit <b>16</b> includes an suppressor clock generator circuit <b>17</b> and a suppressor circuit <b>18</b>. The circuitry in blocks <b>3</b>-<b>15</b> is control circuitry that controls access to array <b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a more detailed diagram of memory array <b>2</b>. Each of the memory cells is a six-transistor memory cell. Reference numeral <b>19</b> identifies the memory cell in the upper left hand corner of the array. Four of the transistors of memory cell <b>19</b> are interconnected to form a pair of cross-coupled inverters <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>. A first data node D of memory cell <b>19</b> is coupled to the output lead of inverter <b>20</b> and is coupled to the input lead of inverter <b>21</b>. A second data node DN of memory cell <b>19</b> is coupled to the output lead of inverter <b>21</b> and is coupled to the input lead of inverter <b>20</b>. A first access transistor <b>22</b> is provided so that data node D can be selectively coupled to a vertically extending bit line B<b>0</b>. A second access transistor <b>23</b> is provided so that data node DN can be selectively coupled to a vertically extending bit line B<b>0</b>N. As illustrated, pairs of bit lines B<b>0</b> and B<b>0</b>N, B<b>1</b> and B<b>1</b>N . . . B<b>15</b> and B<b>15</b>N extend through the array in the vertical dimension. For example, the pair of bit lines B<b>0</b> and B<b>0</b>N extends vertically up through the leftmost column of memory cells. The “N” suffix in this notation indicates “not”, or the complement of the signal having the same signal name without the “N” suffix. A pair of word lines WL<b>0</b> and WL<b>1</b> extends through the array in the horizontal dimension. Word line WL<b>0</b> is coupled to the gates of the access transistors of the various memory cells of the upper row of memory cells of the array. Word line WL<b>1</b> is coupled to the gates of the access transistors of the various memory cells of the lower row of memory cells of the array.</p>
  <p num="p-0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a more detailed diagram of the eight column multiplexer/demultiplexers <b>3</b>-<b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each column multiplexer/demultiplexer has two pairs of bit line leads. Column multiplexer/demultiplexer <b>3</b>, for example, has leads that are coupled to a first pair of bit lines B<b>0</b> and B<b>0</b>N and also has leads that are coupled to a second pair of bit lines B<b>1</b> and B<b>1</b>N. The two pairs of bit lines are illustrated extending down from the top into the column multiplexer/demultiplexer <b>3</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">Each column multiplexer/demultiplexer receives a read column address RCA<b>0</b> and its complement RCA<b>0</b>N. During a read operation, one of the two pairs of bit lines is multiplexed by multiplexer <b>24</b> onto a differential pair of input leads of a sense amplifier <b>25</b>. Which one of the two pairs of bit lines is determined by the values RCA<b>0</b> and RCA<b>0</b>N. Sense amplifier <b>25</b> includes a latch that latches the value being output onto the data output lead of the column multiplexer/demultiplexer. The latch is transparent when an input signal SENS is low and the latch latches on a low-to-high transition of the signal SENS. The data output leads DOUT[<b>0</b>:<b>7</b>] of memory device <b>1</b> are the data output leads of the eight column multiplexers/demultiplexers <b>3</b>-<b>10</b>, respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">Each column multiplexer/demultiplexer also receives an internal clock signal ICLK. The signal ICLK is a precharge signal that causes the bits lines to be precharged when ICLK is low. The ICLK signal is described in further detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">Each column multiplexer/demultiplexer also receives a write column address WCA<b>0</b> and its complement WCA<b>0</b>N. Each column multiplexer/demultiplexer also receives a latched data input value and its complement. The first column multiplexer/demultiplexer <b>3</b>, for example, receives latches input data value DIN[<b>0</b>] and its complement DINN[<b>0</b>]. During a write operation, the input data values DIN[<b>0</b>] and DINN[<b>0</b>] are demultiplexed by demultiplexer <b>26</b> onto one of the two pairs of bit lines that are coupled to the column multiplexer/demultiplexer <b>3</b>. The particular pair of bit lines is determined by the write column address WCA<b>0</b> and its complement WCA<b>0</b>N. Accordingly, during a read operation data passes from a selected pair of the bit lines, through multiplexer <b>24</b>, through the sense amplifier <b>25</b>, and onto the data output lead DOUT[<b>0</b>] of the column multiplexer/demultiplexer <b>3</b>. During a write operation, data passes from the data input leads DIN[<b>0</b>] and DINN[<b>0</b>], through demultiplexer <b>26</b>, and onto a selected pair of the bit lines B<b>0</b> and B<b>0</b>N or B<b>1</b> and B<b>1</b>N.</p>
  <p num="p-0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a more detailed diagram of the address input latch and read/write multiplexer portion of block <b>11</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The circuit of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> latches an incoming two-bit read address RADR[<b>1</b>:<b>0</b>] and also latches an incoming two-bit write address WADR[<b>1</b>:O]. The circuit of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> outputs word line values WL<b>1</b> and WL<b>0</b>, read column address values RCA<b>0</b> and RCA<b>0</b>N, and write column address values WCA<b>0</b> and WCA<b>0</b>N.</p>
  <p num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a more detailed diagram of the data input latch portion of block <b>11</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As illustrated, there are eight identical data input latches <b>27</b>-<b>34</b> that are organized in parallel so that they latch an eight-bit input data value DATAIN[<b>7</b>:<b>0</b>] and output an eight-bit latched data value DIN[<b>7</b>:<b>0</b>] and its complement DINN[<b>7</b>:<b>0</b>]. A write clock signal WCLK is used to latch the incoming input data value DATAIN[<b>7</b>:<b>0</b>] into the eight data input latches. Each data input latch is transparent when the write clock signal WCLK is low, and latches when the write clock signal WCLK transitions low-to-high. In data input latch <b>27</b>, the transistors making up the pass gate <b>35</b> and the cross-coupled inverters <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> together form a transparent latch <b>38</b>. The digital value stored in the data input latch as well as the complement of the digital value stored are supplied onto the data leads DIN[<b>0</b>] and DINN[<b>0</b>] of the data input latch when the read/write decoding clock signal RWDCLK is asserted high. If, on the other hand, the signal RWDCLK is low, then both the signal on both the DIN[<b>0</b>] and DINN[<b>0</b>] output leads are forced high.</p>
  <p num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a more detailed diagram of the read clock generator circuit <b>12</b>, the write clock generator circuit <b>13</b>, the time delayed multiplexer circuit <b>14</b>, the one shot circuit <b>15</b>, and the write clock suppressor circuit <b>16</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The circuitry of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> outputs a read clock signal RCLK, a write clock signal WCLK, the internal clock signal ICLK, and the read/write decoding clock signal RWDCLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Operation of pseudo-dual port memory device <b>1</b> is described below in connection with the waveforms diagrams of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a waveform diagram of a first scenario (Case #<b>1</b>) in which the rising edges of the input clock signal ACLK for the first port and the input clock signal BCLK for the second port occur simultaneously. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a waveform diagram of a second scenario (Case #<b>2</b>) in which the rising edge of the input clock signal ACLK for the first port precedes the rising edge of the input clock signal BCLK for the second port. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a waveform diagram of a third scenario (Case #<b>3</b>) in which the rising edge of the input clock signal BCLK for the second port precedes the input clock signal ACLK for the first port.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">Signals names preceded in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> with an asterisk are externally supplied input signals that are supplied to the pseudo-dual port memory device <b>1</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Initially, the clock signal ICLK is low as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. ICLK is supplied to the column multiplexer/demultiplexers <b>3</b>-<b>10</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When ICLK is low, the P-channel transistors <b>39</b>-<b>41</b> and <b>42</b>-<b>44</b> in each of the column multiplexer/demultiplexers are conductive. All the pairs of bit lines are therefore precharged to supply voltage VCC. This precharging of the bit lines is an initial condition.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">Because a read operation is to be performed, a two-bit read address RADR[<b>1</b>:<b>0</b>] is placed on the two read address input leads <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> of pseudo-dual port memory <b>1</b>, and the read select signal CSAN is asserted on input lead <b>47</b> of pseudo-dual port memory <b>1</b>. Because a write operation is also to be performed, a two-bit write address WADR[<b>1</b>:<b>0</b>] is placed on the two write address input leads <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> of pseudo-dual port memory <b>1</b>, and the write select signal CSBN is asserted on input lead <b>50</b> of pseudo-dual port memory <b>1</b>. The eight-bit data value DATAIN[<b>7</b>:<b>0</b>] that is to be written during the write operation is supplied onto the eight data input leads <b>51</b>-<b>58</b> of the pseudo-dual port memory <b>1</b>. The read address input leads <b>45</b> and <b>46</b>, a read clock input lead <b>59</b>, and the data output leads <b>60</b>-<b>67</b> constitute a first port (a read only port) of the pseudo-dual port memory device <b>1</b>. The write address input leads <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>, a write clock input lead <b>68</b>, and the data input leads <b>51</b>-<b>58</b> constitute a second port (a write only port) of the pseudo-dual port memory device <b>1</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">After the information on input leads <b>45</b>-<b>58</b> and <b>68</b> has been set up for a period of time, the first input clock signal ACLK on input lead <b>47</b> and the second input clock signal BCLK on input lead <b>50</b> transition high simultaneously at time T<b>1</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). When the first input clock signal ACLK transitions high, the value of the read select signal CSAN is latched into the latch of the RCLK generator circuit <b>12</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. If CSAN is low, then the voltage on latch node <b>69</b> is pulled to ground and is latched by cross-coupled inverters <b>70</b>-<b>71</b>. If CSAN is high, then the voltage on node <b>69</b> would have remained in its previously latched state. As the waveform diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, CSAN is low in the presently described operational example. A digital low is therefore latched onto node <b>69</b>. A digital high is therefore latched onto node <b>72</b>. The digital value on node <b>72</b> is the value of the read clock signal RCLK. The read clock signal RCLK therefore transitions high as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">In a similar fashion, the write clock select signal CSBN is latched into the latch of the write clock generator <b>13</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. If CSBN is low, then the voltage on node <b>73</b> is pulled to ground and is latched by cross-coupled inverters <b>74</b>-<b>75</b>. If CSBN is high, then the voltage on node <b>73</b> remains in its previously latched state. As the waveform diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, CSBN is low in the presently described operational example. A digital low is therefore latched onto node <b>73</b>, and a digital high is latched onto node <b>76</b>. The digital value on node <b>76</b> is the value of the write clock signal WCLK. The write clock signal WCLK therefore transitions high as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">In the waveform of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, both ACLK and BCLK were initially digital lows. Because ACLK was low, a digital high was present on node <b>200</b> in the suppression clock generator <b>17</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. P-channel transistor <b>201</b> was therefore non-conductive. Because BCLK was low, a digital low was present on node <b>202</b> in the suppression clock generator <b>17</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. N-channel transistor <b>203</b> was therefore non-conductive. Node <b>204</b> therefore remained latched to hold it previous digital value. When ACLK transitions high as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, inverter <b>205</b> asserts a digital low onto node <b>200</b>, thereby causing P-channel transistor <b>201</b> to be conductive and causing N-channel transistor <b>206</b> to be nonconductive. Node <b>204</b> is therefore pulled up to a digital high. Cross-coupled inverters <b>207</b> and <b>208</b> are latched so that the voltage on node <b>209</b> is a digital low. The voltage on node <b>209</b> is the suppression clock signal SCLK. As long as ACLK is a digital high, the latch of the suppression clock generator <b>17</b> is held in this state, regardless of the value of BCLK. Note in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that the signal SCLK is a digital low at time T<b>1</b> and remains a digital low thereafter.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The address input latch of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a pair of latches <b>77</b> and <b>78</b> for latching the two read address bit values RADR[<b>0</b>] and RADR[<b>1</b>], respectively. Latches <b>77</b> and <b>78</b> are transparent when signal RCLK is low, and latch on the rising edge of RCLK. The value of RADR[<b>1</b>] is therefore latched onto node <b>79</b> in latch <b>77</b> on the rising edge of RCLK. The value of RADR[<b>1</b>] is therefore latched onto node <b>80</b> in latch <b>78</b> on the rising edge of RCLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">At time T<b>1</b> in the waveform diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, RCLK is low and has not yet transitioned high. Latch <b>77</b> is therefore transparent. RADR[<b>0</b>] id therfore present on node <b>79</b>. Because RCLK is low, NAND gate <b>81</b> outputs a digital high. Gating circuit <b>82</b> therefore asserts both RCA<b>0</b> and RCA<b>0</b>N high. Because RCA<b>0</b> and RCA<b>0</b>N are high and are driving the P-channel transistors of the write demultiplexers in the column multiplexer/demultiplexers of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the write demultiplexers are disabled and the bit lines are not coupled to the input leads of the sense amplifiers of the column multiplexer/demultiplexers. The write demultiplexers are disabled because the operation to be performed next is a read operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">At time T<b>1</b> in the waveform diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, RCLK is low and latch <b>78</b> is transparent. RADR[<b>1</b>]<b>0</b> is therefore present on node <b>80</b>. Because RWDCLK is a digital low as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the latched value of RADR[<b>1</b>] on node <b>80</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is supplied through multiplexer <b>83</b> onto node <b>84</b>. Because ICLK is low, however, gating circuit <b>85</b> blocks the signal on node <b>84</b> from being output onto the word line output leads <b>86</b> and <b>87</b>. Digital low signals are present on the word line output leads <b>86</b> and <b>87</b>. Because the access transistors of the memory cells of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are N-channel transistors, the low signals on WL<b>0</b> and WL<b>1</b> prevent any of the access transistors in the array <b>2</b> from being conductive.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The address input latch of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> further includes a second pair of latches <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> for latching the two write address bit values WADR[<b>0</b>] and WADR[<b>1</b>], respectively. Latches <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> are transparent when signal WCLK is low, and latch on the rising edge of WCLK. The value of WADR[<b>0</b>] is therefore latched onto node <b>90</b> in latch <b>88</b> on the rising edge of WCLK. The value of WADR[<b>1</b>] is therefore latched onto node <b>91</b> in latch <b>89</b> on the rising edge of WCLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">At time T<b>1</b> in the waveform diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, WCLK is low and has not yet transitioned high. Latch <b>88</b> is therefore transparent. WADR[<b>0</b>] is therfore present on node <b>90</b>. Because WCLK is low, NAND gate <b>92</b> outputs a digital high. Gating circuit <b>93</b> therefore forces both WCA<b>0</b> and WCA<b>0</b>N low. Because WCA<b>0</b> and WCA<b>0</b>N are low and are driving the N-channel transistors of the multiplexers in the column multiplexer/demultiplexers of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the demultiplexers are disabled and the bit lines are not coupled to the data input leads DIN[<b>7</b>:<b>0</b>] and DINN[<b>7</b>:<b>0</b>] of the column multiplexer/demultiplexers.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">At time T<b>1</b> in the waveform diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, WCLK is low and latch <b>89</b> is transparent. WADR[<b>1</b>] is therefore present on node <b>91</b>. Because RWDCLK is a digital low as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the value on node <b>91</b> is not supplied through multiplexer <b>83</b> onto node <b>84</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">At time T<b>1</b>, ICLK is low. The transistors <b>39</b>-<b>44</b> in the column multiplexer/demultiplexers <b>3</b>-<b>10</b> are therefore conductive. The bit lines of each pair of bit lines are coupled together, and are coupled to supply voltage VCC. The bit lines are therefore said to be precharged.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Next, the externally supplied first input clock signal ACLK and the externally supplied second input clock signal BCLK transition high. The two clock signals ACLK and BCLK transition high simultaneously.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">Before the transition of the signal ACLK, the signal ACLK was a digital low. CSAN was a digital low as indicated by the waveform of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. NOR gate <b>94</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> therefore was supplying a digital high signal onto the gate of N-channel transistor <b>95</b>. When ACLK transitions high, a high signal is present on the gate of N-channel transistor <b>96</b>. Both N-channel transistors <b>96</b> and <b>95</b> are therefore conductive for a short amount of time until the digital high ACLK signal propagates through inverters <b>97</b> and <b>98</b> and NOR gate <b>94</b> to force the voltage on the gate of N-channel transistor <b>95</b> low. The voltage on node <b>69</b> is therefore pulled to ground momentarily through transistors <b>96</b> and <b>95</b>. The voltage on node <b>69</b> is thereby latched to a digital low and the voltage on node <b>72</b> is latched to a digital high. This is illustrated in the waveform of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the low-to-high transition of the signal RCLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">A similar event happens in the WCLK generator <b>13</b>. Before the low-to-high transition of the signal BCLK, CSAB was a digital low as indicated by the waveform of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. NOR gate <b>99</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> therefore was supplying a digital high signal onto the gate of N-channel transistor <b>100</b>. When BCLK transitions high, a high signal is present on the gate of N-channel transistor <b>101</b>. Both N-channel transistors <b>101</b> and <b>100</b> are therefore conductive for a short amount of time until the digital high BCLK signal propagates through inverters <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> and NOR gate <b>99</b> to force the voltage on the gate of N-channel transistor <b>100</b> low. The voltage on node <b>73</b> is therefore pulled to ground momentarily through transistors <b>101</b> and <b>100</b>. The voltage on node <b>73</b> is thereby latched to a digital low and the voltage on node <b>76</b> is latched to a digital high. This is illustrated in the waveform of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the low-to-high transition of the signal WCLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">When RCLK transitions high, latches <b>77</b> and <b>78</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> latch the read address values RADR[<b>0</b>] and RADR[<b>1</b>] onto nodes <b>79</b> and <b>80</b>, respectively. This is illustrated in the waveform label LATCHED AADR[<b>1</b>:<b>0</b>] in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the vertical dashed line. Because RCLK is high and RWDCLK is low, NAND gate <b>81</b> outputs a digital low signal. Gating circuit <b>82</b> therefore does not force both RCA<b>0</b> and RCA<b>0</b>N high as before. The latched RADR[<b>0</b>] value on node <b>79</b> is output as RCA<b>0</b> and its complement is output as RCA<b>0</b>N. The read column address values are supplied to the column multiplexer/demultiplexers <b>3</b>-<b>10</b> in preparation for the upcoming read operation. This is represented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the waveform labeled COLUMN ADR TO COL MUX. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the read column addresses RCA<b>0</b> and RCA<b>0</b>N cause read multiplexer <b>24</b> to select one of the pairs of bit lines and to couple the selected pair to the input leads of sense amplifier <b>25</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">When WCLK transitions high, latches <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> latch the write address values WADR[<b>0</b>] and WADR[<b>1</b>] onto nodes <b>90</b> and <b>91</b>, respectively. This is illustrated in the waveform labeled LATCHED BADR[<b>1</b>:<b>0</b>] in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the vertical dashed line. Because signal RWDCLK is a digital low, however, NAND gate <b>92</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> continues to output a digital high, and gating circuit <b>93</b> continues to force both write column address values WCA<b>0</b> and WCA<b>0</b>N low to their inactive states. The WADR[<b>1</b>] address value that is latched onto node <b>91</b> is blocked from being output onto the word line WL because RWDCLK is a digital low and is selecting the upper input lead of multiplexer <b>83</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the high-to-low transition on node <b>69</b> is supplied onto the lower input lead of NAND gate <b>104</b>.

NAND gate <b>106</b> therefore outputs a digital low signal, thereby causing P-channel transistor <b>107</b> to be made conductive. Node <b>69</b> is pulled high because node <b>69</b> is coupled to VCC through transistor <b>107</b>. The signal RCLK on node <b>72</b> therefore transitions low.

It is therefore seen that the time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> and the one shot circuit <b>105</b> operate together to clear the RCLK signal low at the end of the read operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">A digital high is present on the upper input lead of NAND gate <b>104</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. ICLK is therefore low.

The precharging transistors <b>39</b>-<b>44</b> in the column multiplexer/demultiplexers are therefore made conductive again to start a precharging operation for the upcoming write operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">Before the data being output from the memory device can change due to the precharging, a sense signal SENS is supplied to the latched in the sense amplifiers in the column multiplexer/demultiplexers. The low-to-high transition of the signal SENS causes the latches in the column multiplexer/demultiplexers to latch and hold the data values that is being read out on the output leads <b>60</b>-<b>67</b> of the memory device <b>1</b>. A one shot circuit (not shown) generates the SENS signal and pulses the SENS signal high upon the falling edge of the signal ICLK when RWDCLK is low. The latching of the output data is considered the end of the read operation.</p>

NOR gate <b>108</b> therefore outputs a digital high signal. This signal propagates through inverters <b>109</b> and <b>110</b>. RWDCLK therefore transitions high as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the low-to-high transition in the waveform labeled RWDCLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the low-to-high transition in the signal RWDCLK causes the write address values to be output from the address input latch of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. RWDCLK being high causes a digital low to be present on the upper input lead of NAND gate <b>81</b>. NAND gate <b>81</b> therefore outputs a digital high. This causes gating circuit <b>82</b> to force RCA<b>0</b> and RCA<b>0</b>N to digital high values.

  <p num="p-0069">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, RWDCLK being high causes NAND gate <b>92</b> to output a digital high signal. Gating circuit <b>93</b> therefore no longer blocks the write address value WADR[<b>0</b>] latched in latch <b>88</b> from being output onto WCA<b>0</b> and WCA<b>0</b>N. The write column address value WADR[<b>0</b>] is therefore communicated through gating circuit <b>93</b> to the write demultiplexer <b>26</b> in the column multiplexer/demultiplexer of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The data input values on DIN[<b>7</b>:<b>0</b>] and DINN[<b>7</b>:<b>0</b>] are therefore communicated through the write demultiplexers of the column multiplexer/demultiplexers onto a selected set of eight pairs of bit lines. Which set of eight pairs is selected is determined by the values of WCA<b>0</b> and WCA<b>0</b>N. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the data values are communicated through the write demultiplexer and up into the memory array <b>2</b> so that the data values can be written into the row of memory cells identified by word line address values WL<b>0</b> and WL<b>1</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the low-to-high transition of RWDCLK continues to propagate through inverters <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> and onto the upper input lead of NAND gate <b>113</b>. Because SCLK has been a digital low, inverter <b>210</b> in the suppressor circuit <b>18</b> has been outputting a digital high onto the lower input lead of NAND gate <b>211</b>. Because WCLK is a digital high, NAND gate <b>211</b> outputs a digital low, and inverter <b>212</b> asserts the signal SWCLK high. Accordingly, when SCLK is low, the write clock WCLK is gated through suppressor circuit <b>18</b> and is output as SWCLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">Because the digital high signal SWCLK has been present on the lower input lead of NAND gate <b>113</b> in the time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b>, the low-to-high transition on the upper input lead of NAND gate <b>113</b> causes NAND gate <b>113</b> to output a digital low signal, which is inverted by inverter <b>114</b>. A digital high signal is therefore asserted onto the upper input lead of NAND gate <b>115</b>. A digital high signal was already present on the lower input lead of NAND gate <b>115</b> due to the low value of the signal RESET causing NAND gate <b>116</b> of the WCLK generator circuit <b>13</b> to output a digital high signal. NAND gate <b>115</b> therefore outputs a digital low signal, thereby causing NAND gate <b>104</b> to assert ICLK high. This propagation delay from the rising edge of RWDCLK to the rising edge of ICLK is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the dashed arrow labeled B. The rising edge of the signal ICLK terminates the precharge of the write operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rising edge of ICLK is supplied to gating circuit <b>85</b>. Gating circuit <b>85</b> therefore no longer forces both WL<b>0</b> and WL<b>1</b> to be low, but rather allows the write address value WADR[<b>1</b>] on node <b>84</b> to be output onto word line WL<b>1</b> output lead <b>86</b>. The write address value that was latched into node <b>91</b> is multiplexed onto node <b>84</b> due to the value of RWDCLK being a digital high during the write operation. The result is that the write address value WADR[<b>1</b>] is output onto WL<b>1</b> output lead <b>86</b> and its complement is output onto WL<b>0</b> output lead <b>87</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the transitioning in the waveform labeled WL (ONE OF WL<b>0</b> AND WL<b>1</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The write address value WADR[<b>0</b>] and WADR[<b>1</b>] are therefore used to address memory array <b>2</b> during the write operation. This is represented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the label WCA that appears in the waveform labeled COLUMN ADR TO COL MUX. Data in the eight addressed memory cells may switch at time T<b>3</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the low-to-high transitioning of ICLK is again detected by one shot circuit <b>105</b>. After a delay represented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the dashed arrow labeled C, one shot circuit <b>105</b> outputs a high pulse of the signal RESET. The high pulse of the signal RESET is asserted onto the upper input lead of NAND gate <b>116</b>. Because RWDCLK is now high, there are digital high signals on both input leads of NAND gate <b>116</b>. NAND gate <b>116</b> drives a digital low signal onto the gate of P-channel transistor <b>117</b>, thereby latching a digital high signal onto node <b>73</b> in the WCLK generator circuit <b>13</b>. Signal WCLK on node <b>76</b> therefore transitions low. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the high-to-low transition of the waveform WCLK. The time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> and one shot circuit <b>105</b> therefore together cause the resetting of the signal WCLK low at the end of the write operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">WCLK transitioning low causes NAND gate <b>211</b> in suppressor circuit <b>18</b> to output a digital high. Inverter <b>212</b> therefore forces SWCLK low. WCLK is therefore gated through suppressor circuit <b>18</b> because the suppression signal SCLK is low.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">SWCLK transitioning low causes NAND gate <b>113</b> in time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> to output a digital high. Inverter <b>114</b> outputs a digital low thereby causing NAND gate <b>115</b> to output a digital high. Because RCLK is a digital low, the voltage on node <b>69</b> in the RCLK generator circuit <b>12</b> is a digital high. There are digital high signals on both input leads of NAND gate <b>104</b>, thereby causing NAND gate <b>104</b> to assert ICLK low. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the second high-to-low transition of the signal ICLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">SWCLK transitioning low also causes a digital high signal to be present on the lower input lead of NOR gate <b>108</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. NOR gate <b>108</b> outputs a digital low signal that propagates through inverters <b>109</b> and <b>110</b>, thereby causing RWDCLK to transition low at the end of the write operation. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the high-to-low transition in the waveform labeled RWDCLK. At this point, precharging of the bit lines of memory array <b>2</b> is initiated in preparation for a subsequent memory access operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">It is therefore recognized that pseudo-dual port memory device <b>1</b> performs a read operation followed by a write operation. The end of the read operation and the beginning of the write operation are not dependent on the falling edge of an input clock signal. Rather, asynchronous propagation delays through logic circuitry and a one shot circuit are used to time the control signals necessary to carry out the first read operation, to precharge the bit lines of the memory for a second operation, and to carry out the second write operation. The amounts of time of delay A, delay B, and delay C can be increased or decreased during the design of a memory device in order to change the relative amount of time that is allotted for the read operation versus the write operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0079"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a simplified waveform diagram for case #<b>1</b>. The rising edges of ACLK and BCLK coincide. SCLK remains low and never transitions high. The suppressor circuit <b>18</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> therefore always passes the value of WCLK through to be the value of SWCLK. The signal SWCLK is supplied to the time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> in the place of WCLK. The time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> therefore receives RCLK and SWCLK (which has the same timing as WCLK), and generates the time delayed signal RWDCLK so as to perform the read operation followed by the write operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">In the above-described scenario, there is both a read operation and a write operation to be performed. In a scenario in which only a read operation is to be performed, then RCLK would be latched high, RWDCLK would be forced low for the read operation, one shot circuit <b>105</b> would then clear RCLK low, but WCLK would not have been latched high. Consequently, RWDCLK would not be forced high at the end of the read operation, and there would be no second write operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">Similarly, in a scenario in which only a write operation is to be performed, then WCLK would be latched high but RCLK would not be latched high. RWDCLK would therefore be forced high for a write operation, one shot circuit <b>105</b> would then reset WCLK low at the end of the read operation, but there would be no second memory operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">Consider a situation in which WCLK were latched high when RCLK had not yet been latched high. Time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> would assert RWDCLK high for a write operation and the write operation would be initiated as described above in a condition wherein a write operation is to be performed but no read operation is to be performed. If RCLK were then latched high (as in case #<b>3</b>) due to an attempted read from the first port, then NOR gate <b>108</b> in time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> would output a digital low, the low signal would propagate through inverters <b>109</b> and <b>110</b>, and RWDCLK would be asserted low. Asserting RWDCLK low before completion of the write operation, however, may cause a malfunction of the pseudo-dual port memory. The suppression clock generator <b>17</b> and the suppressor circuit <b>18</b> prevent such a situation by suppressing assertion of WCLK high as it is presented to time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> (WCLK is presented to time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> as SWCLK) until the RCLK signal has transitioned high. Suppression of WCLK in this manner prevents the malfunction that would otherwise have occurred if RCLK were asserted shortly after a write operation had been initiated.</p>

In case #<b>2</b>, the first input clock signal ACLK that is supplied to the first port of the memory is asserted high first at time T<b>1</b>A. The values of CSAN and AADR[<b>1</b>:<b>0</b>] are therefore latched into the memory shortly after time T<b>1</b>A.

  <p num="p-0084">Because the read operation is to occur before the write operation, the earlier rising ACLK causes RCLK to be asserted. RCLK in turn initiates the read operation before the rising edge of BCLK. When the read operation is completed as determined by propagation delay A and the subsequent falling edge of RCLK, the time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> asserts RWDCLK to initiate the write operation.

  <p num="p-0086"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a waveform diagram that illustrates an operation of pseudo-dual port memory <b>1</b> in case #<b>3</b>.

The values of CSAN and AADR[<b>1</b>:<b>0</b>] for the read operation are therefore latched into the memory shortly after time T<b>1</b>A.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">Because the write operation is to occur after the read operation, the earlier rising BCLK cannot be allowed to assert SWCLK high so that the write operation is initiated. The suppression clock SCLK is therefore asserted high during an initial period (roughly between time T<b>1</b>B and time T<b>1</b>A) until the read clock ACLK transitions high. During this initial period, SCLK suppresses the write clock that is being supplied to the time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> (the write clock WCLK is supplied to time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> as SWCLK). Suppressing SWCLK during this initial period prevents the time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> from initiating the write operation before the read operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">Generation of the suppression clock SCLK is explained in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. ACLK at this time is low. Inverter <b>205</b> therefore outputs a digital high onto node <b>200</b>. P-channel transistor <b>201</b> is therefore non-conductive and N-channel transistor <b>206</b> is conductive. BCLK is initially low, and then transitions high. Inverters <b>213</b>-<b>215</b> therefore initially output a digital high onto the gate of N-channel transistor <b>216</b>. Transistor <b>216</b> is therefore initially conductive but node <b>204</b> is not coupled to ground because N-channel transistor <b>203</b> is nonconductive. When BCLK transitions high, the voltage on node <b>202</b> transitions high thereby making N-channel transistor <b>203</b> conductive. It takes time, however, for the high signal on node <b>202</b> to propagate through inverters <b>213</b>-<b>215</b> to force the gate of N-channel transistor <b>216</b> low and turn transistor <b>216</b> off. Therefore, for a short period of time after the rising edge of BCLK, all three N-channel pulldown transistors <b>203</b>, <b>216</b> and <b>206</b> are conductive and node <b>204</b> is momentarily coupled to ground potential. The momentary coupling to ground potential latches a digital low onto node <b>204</b>. The suppression clock SCLK on node <b>209</b> is therefore asserted high. This illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> by the rising edge of the waveform labeled SCLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">Even through WCLK rises shortly after time T<b>1</b>B, the high value of suppression clock SCLK suppresses the write clock signal SWCLK supplied to the time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b>. This condition persists until the input clock signal ACLK for the read port transitions high. When ACLK transitions high, inverter <b>205</b> outputs a digital low onto node <b>200</b>. P-channel pullup transistor <b>201</b> is made conductive, and node <b>204</b> is latched and held high. SCLK is therefore latched and held low, thereby ending the initial period of time that the suppression clock SCLK is asserted. The rising edges of RCLK and SWCLK are therefore presented to time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> at substantially the same time.</p>
  <p num="p-0090"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a simplified waveform diagram for case #<b>3</b>. The rising edge of BCLK precedes the rising edge of ACLK. The rising edge of BCLK when ACLK is low causes the latch in the suppression clock generator <b>17</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to latch a digital low onto node <b>204</b>, thereby latching suppression clock signal SCLK high. The suppressor circuit <b>18</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> therefore suppresses SWCLK and keeps SWCLK low during the time SCLK is high. When ACLK transitions high, a digital high is latched onto node <b>204</b> in the suppression clock generator <b>17</b>, thereby latching SCLK low. SWCLK is therefore no longer held low by suppressor circuit <b>18</b>. The value of the write clock WCLK is the value of SWCLK for the remainder of the read and write operations. The time delayed multiplexer <b>14</b> and one shot <b>105</b> initiate the read operation and then the write operation as in cases #<b>1</b> and #<b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0091"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a simplified waveform diagram illustrating an operation of pseudo-dual port memory <b>1</b> in a situation in which ACLK has a higher frequency than BCLK. The first rising edge of ACLK occurs at the same time as the first rising edge of BCLK. This is the situation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The first write operation follows the first read operation. In the scenario of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, there is no rising edge of BCLK around the time of the second rising edge of ACLK. The second rising edge of BCLK in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> therefore gives rise to a second read operation. In the example, the third rising edge of ACLK occurs at the same time as the second rising edge of BCLK. This is the condition of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The second write operation therefore follows the third read operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a simplified waveform diagram illustrating an operation of pseudo-dual port memory <b>1</b> in a situation in which a rising edge of BCLK occurs at an earlier time during the low portion of ACLK. The rising edge of BCLK causes SCLK to be asserted, thereby suppressing SWCLK until the third rising edge of ACLK. The write operation is therefore delayed until after the third read operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a simplified waveform diagram illustrating an operation of pseudo-dual port memory <b>1</b> in a situation in which a rising edge of BCLK occurs more than three gate delays before the falling edge of ACLK. BCLK therefore rises during the time ACLK is high. In this situation, ACLK is high and is holding node <b>204</b> pulled up to VCC when the rising edge of BCLK attempts to momentarily pull node <b>204</b> to ground. Because N-channel transistor <b>206</b> is nonconductive, node <b>204</b> is not pulled to ground and SCLK is not latched high. SWCLK is therefore not suppressed during an initial period. SWCLK is therefore illustrated going high shortly after BCLK transitions high. This causes a write operation to occur immediately following the second read operation. The second read operation in the waveform of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is the read operation due to the second rising edge of ACLK.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">The amounts of time of delay A, delay B, and delay C can be increased or decreased during the design of a memory device in order to change the relative proportion of time that is allotted for the read operation versus the write operation. The end of the read operation can overlap the beginning of the write operation in time. In some implementations of a memory device, the read operation may be allotted more time than the write operation. In other implementations, the write operation may be allotted more time than the read operation. Problems associated with initiating the write operation using the falling edge of an external clock signal where the falling edge has an undesirably large amount of jitter are avoided because the falling edge of an externally supplied clock signal is not used to terminate the first read operation and/or to initiate the second write operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">Although certain specific embodiments are described above for instructional purposes, the present invention is not limited thereto. The control circuitry of the pseudo-dual port memory can be used in embodiments where the first memory access operation is a write operation and the second memory access operation is a read operation, where the first memory access operation is a write operation and the second memory access operation is a write operation, and where the first memory access operation is a read operation and the second memory access operation is a read operation.
