    <p>The present invention relates to a process for hydrogenating benzenepolycarboxylic acids or derivatives thereof, such as esters and/or anhydrides, by bringing one or more benzenepolycarboxylic acids or one or more derivatives thereof into contact with a hydrogen-containing gas in the presence of a catalyst containing macropores.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the present invention also relates to selected products as obtained by the hydrogenation according to the invention as such, i.e. the corresponding cyclohexane compounds, in particular of cyclohexanedicarboxylic esters and cyclohexanetricarboxylic esters, in particular the cyclohexanedicarboxylic esters and cyclohexanetricarboxylic esters. Furthermore, the invention also relates to the use of the obtained cyclohexanedicarboxylic esters as plasticizers in plastics.</p>
    <p>In U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,898 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,129, dimethyl terephthalate is hydrogenated at â§140Â° C. and a pressure of from 50 to 170 bar over supported Pd catalysts which are treated with Ni, Pt and/or Ru to give the corresponding dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate. In DE-A 28 23 165, aromatic carboxylic esters are hydrogenated at from 70 to 250Â° C. and from 30 to 200 bar over supported Ni, Ru, Rh and/or Pd catalysts to give the corresponding cycloaliphatic carboxylic esters. U.S. Pat. No. 3,027,398 describes the hydrogenation of dimethyl terephthalate over supported Ru catalysts at from 110 to 140Â° C. and from 35 to 105 bar.</p>
    <p>EP-A 0 603 825 relates to a process for the preparation of 1,4-cycylohexanedicarboxylic acid by hydrogenating terephthalic acid by using a supported palladium catalyst, wherein as support alumina, silica or active charcoal is used. The process described therein is particularly characterized in that the solution comprising an 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid as obtained in a first step is brought into contact with steam, thereby leading to an extraction of the impurities as obtained in said solution. This process is, however, only applicable to acids, since when using it for derivatives, such as e.g. esters, anhydrides, etc. there exists the risk of hydrolysis. The use of a support comprising macropores is not mentioned in this application.</p>
    <p>Up to now, predominantly phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl or isononyl esters of phthalic acid have been used as plasticizers in plastics, such as PVC, as may be deduced from e.g. FR-A 2,397,131. However, since recently these compounds are regarded as being detrimental under health aspects and thus their use in plastics for producing e.g. tools for children is under an increasing criticism, in some countries their use is even forbidden.</p>
    <p>The use of several cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid esters as plasticizer is known from the prior art. Described is the use of cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid dimethyl or diethyl esters (DE-A 28 23 165), cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid di(isononyl)ester (EP-A 07-011074) and cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid di(2-ethylhexyl)ester (DE-A 12 63 296) as plasticizers in plastic.</p>
    <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for hydrogenating benzenepolycarboxylic acids or derivatives, in particular benzenedicarboxylic esters, using specific catalysts, by means of which the corresponding ring-hydrogenated derivatives, in particular cyclohexanedicarboxylic esters, can be obtained with a very high selectivity and in a very high space-time yield without significant secondary reactions.</p>
    <p>A further object of the present invention lies in providing new products which are obtainable by the hydrogenation of benzenepolycarboxylic acid (derivatives) according to the invention, which should be preferably useable as plasticizers in plastics.</p>
    <p>The present invention accordingly provides a process for hydrogenating a benzenepolycarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof or a mixture of two or more thereof by bringing the benzenepolycarboxylic acid or the derivative thereof or the mixture of two or more thereof into contact with a hydrogen-containing gas in the presence of a catalyst which comprises as active metal at least one metal of transition group VIII of the Periodic Table alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I or VIII of the periodic table applied to a support which contains macropores with the proviso that</p>
    <p>if dimethyl terephthalate is hydrogenated, the hydrogenation using a catalyst which comprises as active metal ruthenium either alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I, VII or VIII of the Periodic Table applied to a support, where the support has a mean pore diameter of at least 50 nm and a BET surface area of at most 30 m<sup>2</sup>/g and the amount of the active metal is from 0.01 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst, and the ratio of the surface areas of the active metal and the catalyst support is less than 0.05, or</p>
    <p>a catalyst which comprises as active metal ruthenium either alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I, VII or VIII of the Periodic Table in an amount of from 0.01 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst, applied to a support, where from 10 to 50% of the pore volume of the support is formed by macropores having a pore diameter in the range from 50 nm to 10,000 nm and from 50 to 90% of the pore volume of the support is formed by mesopores having a pore diameter in the range from 2 to 50 nm, where the sum of the pore volumes adds up to 100%, is excluded.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a process for hydrogenating a benzenepolycarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof or a mixture of two or more thereof, wherein the catalyst comprises as active metal at least one metal of transition group VIII of the Periodic Table either alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I or VII of the Periodic Table applied to a support, where the support has a mean pore diameter of at least 50 nm and a BET surface area of at most 30 m<sup>2</sup>/g and the amount of the active metal is from 0.01 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst (catalyst 1).</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the present invention provides a process of this type in which the catalyst comprises as active metal at least one metal of transition group VIII of the Periodic Table either alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I or VII of the Periodic Table in an amount of from 0.01 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst, applied to a support, where from 10 to 50% of the pore volume of the support is formed by macropores having a pore diameter in the range from 50 nm to 10,000 nm and from 50 to 90% of the pore volume of the support is formed by mesopores having a pore diameter in the range from 2 to 50 nm, where the sum of the pore volumes adds up to 100% (catalyst 2).</p>
    <p>In a further preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a process as defined above in which the catalyst (catalyst 3) comprises as active metal at least one metal of transition group VIII of the Periodic Table either alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I or VII of the Periodic Table in an amount of from 0.01 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst, applied to a support, where the support has a mean pore diameter of at least 0.1 {grave over (l)}m and a BET surface area of at most 15 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Supports used can in principle be all supports which contain macropores, i.e. supports which contain only macropores as well as those which contain mesopores and/or micropores in addition to macropores.</p>
    <p>Active metals which can be used are in principle all metals of transition group VIII of the Periodic Table. Preference is given to using platinum, rhodium, palladium, cobalt, nickel or ruthenium or a mixture of two or more thereof as active metal; particular preference is given to using ruthenium as active metal. Among the metals of transition group I or VII or else transition groups I and VII of the Periodic Table which are likewise all usable in principle, preference is given to using copper and/or rhenium.</p>
    <p>For the purposes of the present invention, the terms âmacroporesâ and âmesoporesâ are used as they are defined in <i>Pure Appl. Chem., </i>45 (1976), 79, namely as pores whose diameter is above 50 nm (macropores) or whose diameter is from 2 nm and 50 nm (mesopores).</p>
    <p>The active metal content is generally from about 0.01 to about 30% by weight, preferably from about 0.01 to about 5% by weight and in particular from about 0.1 to about 5% by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the catalyst used; the contents preferably used in the preferred catalysts 1 to 3 described below will again be specified individually in the discussion of these catalysts.</p>
    <p>The term âbenzenepolycarboxylic acid or a derivative thereofâ used for the purposes of the present invention encompasses all benzenepolycarboxylic acids as such, e.g. phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, trimellitic acid, trimesic acid, hemimellitic acid and pyromellitic acid, and derivatives thereof, particularly monoesters, diesters and possibly triesters and tetra-esters, in particular alkyl esters, and anhydrides. The compounds which are preferably used will be briefly described once more in the section âMethod of carrying out the processâ below.</p>
    <p>The catalysts 1 to 3 which are preferably used will now be described in detail below. In the description, ruthenium is used as active metal by way of example, but the statements made below are also applicable to the other active metals which can be used, as defined herein.</p>
    <heading>Catalyst 1</heading> <p>The catalysts 1 used according to the present invention can be produced industrially by applying at least one metal of transition group VIII of the Periodic Table and, if desired, at least one metal of transition group I or VII of the Periodic Table to a suitable support.</p>
    <p>The metal(s) can be applied by steeping the support in aqueous metal salt solutions such as aqueous ruthenium salt solutions, by spraying appropriate metal salt solutions onto the support or by other suitable methods. Suitable metal salts of transition group I, VII or VIII of the Periodic Table are the nitrates, nitrosyl nitrates, halides, carbonates, carboxylates, acetylacetonates, chloro complexes, nitrito complexes or ammine complexes of the corresponding metals, with preference being given to the nitrates and nitrosyl nitrates.</p>
    <p>In the case of metals which have not only a metal of transition group VIII of the Periodic Table but also further metals applied as active metals to the support, the metal salts or metal salt solutions can be applied simultaneously or in succession.</p>
    <p>The supports which have been coated or impregnated with the metal salt solution are subsequently dried, preferably at from 100 to 150Â° C., and, if desired, calcined at from 200 to 600Â° C., preferably from 350 to 450Â° C. In the case of separate impregnation, the catalyst is dried and, if desired, calcined as described above after each impregnation step. The order in which the support is impregnated with the active components is immaterial.</p>
    <p>The coated and dried and, if desired, calcined supports are subsequently activated by treatment in a gas stream comprising free hydrogen at from about 30 to about 600Â° C., preferably from about 150 to about 450Â° C. The gas stream preferably consists of from 50 to 100% by volume of H<sub>2 </sub>and from 0 to 50% by volume of N<sub>2</sub>.</p>

This amount is preferably from 0.2 to 15% by weight, particularly preferably about 0.5% by weight.</p>

    <heading>Method of Carrying Out the Process</heading> <p>In the process of the present invention, the hydrogenation is generally carried out at from about 50 to 250Â° C., preferably from about 70 to 220Â° C. The pressures used here are generally above 10 bar, preferably from about 20 to about 300 bar.</p>
    <p>The process of the present invention can be carried out either continuously or batchwise, with preference being given to carrying out the process continuously.</p>
    <p>When the process is carried out continuously, the amount of the benzenepolycarboxylic acid or ester to be hydrogenated or of the mixture of two or more thereof is preferably from about 0.05 to about 3 kg per liter of catalyst per hour, more preferably from about 0.1 to about 1 kg per liter of catalyst per hour.</p>
    <p>As hydrogenation gases, it is possible to use any gases which comprise free hydrogen and do not contain harmful amounts of catalyst poisons such as CO. For example, waste gases from a reformer can be used. Preference is given to using pure hydrogen as hydrogenation gas.</p>
    <p>The hydrogenation of the present invention can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent or diluent, i.e. it is not necessary to carry out the hydrogenation in solution.</p>
    <p>However, preference is given to using a solvent or diluent. Solvents or diluents which can be used are any suitable solvent or diluent. The choice is not critical as long as the solvent or diluent used is able to form a homogeneous solution with the benzenepolycarboxylic acid or ester to be hydrogenated. For example, the solvents or diluents can also comprise water.</p>
    <p>Examples of suitable solvents or diluents include the following:</p>
    <p>straight-chain or cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, and also aliphatic alcohols in which the alkyl radical preferably has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, in particular from 3 to 6 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p>Examples of alcohols which are preferably used are i-propanol, n-butanol, i-butanol and n-hexanol.</p>
    <p>Mixtures of these or other solvents or diluents can likewise be used.</p>
    <p>The amount of solvent or diluent used is not restricted in any particular way and can be selected freely depending on requirements. However, preference is given to amounts which lead to a 10-70% strength by weight solution of the benzenepolycarboxylic acid or ester to be hydrogenated.</p>
    <p>In the process of the present invention, particular preference is given to using the product formed in the hydrogenation, i.e. the corresponding cyclohexane derivative, as solvent, if desired in addition to other solvents or diluents. In any case, part of the product formed in the process can be mixed with the benzenepolycarboxylic acid still to be hydrogenated or the derivative thereof The amount of reaction product which is mixed in as solution or diluent is preferably from 1 to 30 times, particularly preferably from 5 to 20 times, in particular from 5 to 10 times, the weight of the compound to be hydrogenated.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, the term âbenzenepolycarboxylic acids or derivatives thereofâ used for the purposes of the present invention encompasses both the respective benzenepolycarboxylic acids as such and derivatives thereof, particularly monoesters, diesters or possibly triesters or tetraesters and also anhydrides of the benzenepolycarboxylic acids. The esters used are alkyl, cycloalkyl and alkoxyalkyl esters, where the alkyl, cycloalkyl and alkoxyalkyl groups generally have from 1 to 30, preferably from 2 to 20 and particularly preferably from 3 to 18, carbon atoms and can be branched or linear.</p>

    <p>1,2-di-C<sub>7-9</sub>-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ester, obtainable by hydrogenating the corresponding phthalic acid ester, which comprises branched and linear C<sub>7-9</sub>-alkylester groups; respective phthalic acid esters which may be e.g. used as starting materials have the following CAS Nos.:</p>
    <p>di-C<sub>7-9</sub>-alkylphthalate having the CAS No. 111 381-89-6;</p>
    <p>di-C<sub>7</sub>-alkylphthalate having the CAS No. 68515-44-6; and</p>
    <p>di-C<sub>9</sub>-alkylphthalate having the CAS No. 68515-45-7.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the present invention also provides for the use of cyclohexanepolycarboxylic esters, in particular the cyclohexanepolycarboxylic esters obtained using the process of the present invention, as plasticizers in plastics. Here, preference is generally given to diesters and triesters containing alkyl groups having from 3 to 18 carbon atoms and particular preference is given to the abovementioned, individually listed esters having from 3 to 18 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p>More preferably, the above explicitly mentioned new C<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>-, C<sub>9</sub>-, C<sub>10</sub>-, C<sub>7-11</sub>-, C<sub>9-11</sub>- and C<sub>7-9</sub>-esters of 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acids, as being obtainable by hydrogenating the corresponding phthalates and more preferably the hydrogenation products of the commercially available benzenepolycarboxylic acid esters with the trade names Jayflex DINP (CAS No. 68515-48-0), Jayflex DIDP (CAS No. 68515-49-1), Palatinol 9-P, Vestinol 9 (CAS No. 28553-12-0), TOTM-I (CAS No. 3319-31-1), Linplast 68-TM and Palatinol N (CAS No. 28553-12-0) are used as plasticizers in plastics. Among those is in tun preferred to use these compounds or mixtures thereof as plasticizers in mass plastics, such as e.g. PVC and polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisoprene and copolymers of ethylene or propylene and 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene.</p>
    <p>Compared to the until now predominantly phthalates as used as plasticizers, the cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid (derivatives), as used according to the invention, exhibit a lower density and viscosity and lead to e.g. an improvement of the flexibility at low temperatures (KÃ¤lteflexibilitÃ¤t) of the plastic when compared with the usage of the corresponding phthalates as plasticizers, while properties such as shore A hardness and the mechanical properties of the resulting plastics are identical to those as resulting from the usage of phthalates. Furthermore, the cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acid (derivative)s according to the invention exhibit an improved process ability in the dry blend and as a result thereof a higher production speed. In the Plastisol processing by exhibit advantages attributed to the lower viscosity when compared with conventional phthalates.</p>
    <p>The process of the present invention is illustrated below by means of some examples.</p>

    <heading>Example 14</heading> <p>A vertical high-pressure tube made of steel having an inner diameter of 30 mm and a length of 2.2 m was filled with 1.4 l of the supported Ru catalyst. In the slurry process, 0.45 kg/h Palatinol N (CAS No. 28553-12-0) were pumped together with pure hydrogen from the bottom to the top through the reactor at an average temperature of 125Â° C. and a pressure of 200 bar. After leaving the high-pressure reactor, part of the reaction product was reintroduced into the reactor together with new Palatinol N, while the residual reaction product was vented in a container. The hydrogenation was carried out with a 20% excess of the theoretically required hydrogen while controlling the spent gas. Gaschromatographic analysis of the reaction product showed that Palatinol N has been reacted to an extent of 99.5%. The corresponding cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ester was obtained with a selectivity of 99.2%. In order to remove the remaining 0.5% Palatinol from the reaction product, the same was pumped through the reactor from the bottom to the top in an amount of 1 kg/h, and the product was vented in a container. The addition of hydrogen was continued as described above. Subsequently, no Palatinol N was found in the product. The selectivity with respect to the corresponding cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ester after the second hydrogenation was 99%. As side components, about 1% low boiling components (components having a lower boiling point compared to cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ester) were found. These components were reduced by means of a vapor distillation at 170Â° C. and a pressure of 50 mbar. The product consisted after this work-up of 99.7% cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ester.</p>
