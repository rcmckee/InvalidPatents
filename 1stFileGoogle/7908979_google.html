    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This invention relates to a pallet.</p>
    <p num="p-0003">This invention has particular, but not exclusive, application to a pallet that is used as a moveable platform on which goods are placed for storage and/or transportation, including handling using a forklift truck. However, it will be appreciated that this invention may also be used in the construction of a base for various types of packaging to be used for storage and/or transportation of goods, including containers and creates.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Pallets typically include a platform and a plurality of dependent supports that are capable of supporting the platform above a foundation or a structure, such as a rack, upon which the pallet rests. Further both the arrangement of the supports and the space separating the platform and the foundation upon which it rests are typically sufficient to allow a forklift tine to be located there between.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">It will be appreciated that the cost of a consumer item is dependent upon many factors including the cost of packaging, transportation and storage of the item.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Pallets, being a load bearing structure, have traditionally been manufactured from heavy and expensive materials, such as timber and steel. Whereas once there was an abundance of timber and pallets and other forms of packaging made from timber were viewed as throwaway items, timber has in recent years become a scarce resource. As a consequence the cost of timber, and therefore pallets, has increased in recent years.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Further, in an effort to prevent the transfer of unwanted pests and diseases from one country to another, some countries will only permit the importation of goods made of materials that are known to be good carriers of pests and diseases, such as timber, if they have been chemically treated. Accordingly, in order to comply with the customs requirements of many countries, pallets made from timber must be fumigated, which adds to the costs associated with the transportation and storage of consumer items.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Typically freight charges are dependent upon the combined weight of the article and any associated packaging. Accordingly, it is desirous that any packaging, including pallets, used for the transportation of goods be made from light weight materials, such as various plastics materials.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In highly competitive markets, such as those relating to the sale of electronic goods and “white” goods, where margins are small, savings relating to the cost of transportation and storage of items are most desirous.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In an effort to overcome the problems associated with pallets made of timber, various vacuum formed pallets having a core made from expanded polystyrene encapsulated by an external skin made from a thermoplastics material have been developed and are currently being used. However, the inventors are not aware of either a two way entry and/or a four way entry, rackable, vacuum formed, pallet.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0011">It is an object of the present invention to provide a pallet that ameliorates at least some of the deficiencies of the prior art and/or a two way entry, vacuum formed, pallet that is rackable, and/or a four way entry, vacuum formed, pallet that is rackable, and/or a stronger vacuum formed pallet, and/or a vacuum formed pallet that is more economical to produce, and/or a vacuum formed pallet that is more durable.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">With the foregoing in view, this invention in one aspect relates to a rackable pallet having load bearing capabilities on which one or more articles may be placed for storage and/or transportation, including:</p>
    <p num="p-0013">a body having a platform that includes an upper side face upon which the article or articles may rest and a plurality of supports that depend from an underside face of said platform, said supports being adapted to provide support for said platform and to space said platform above a foundation or a structure on which the pallet rests, said body being constructed from predominantly one or more light weight materials having no or little inherent load bearing capacity;</p>
    <p num="p-0014">an external skin that is bonded to and envelopes the underside face of said platform and said supports and at least some of the upper side face of said platform, and</p>
    <p num="p-0015">a plurality of bridges that extend between adjacent supports, said bridges being spaced from the underside of said platform and adapted to provide support for the pallet when at least some of said bridges rest upon frame members of a rack, and whereby in use a forklift having a plurality of tines may be used to move the pallet and wherein each tine may be locatable between adjacent supports and/or between the underside of said platform and one or more bridges.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">In another aspect, this invention relates to a pallet having load bearing capabilities on which one or more articles may be placed for storage and/or transportation, including:</p>
    <p num="p-0017">a body having a platform that includes an upper side face upon which the article or articles may rest and a plurality of supports that depend from an underside face of said platform, said supports being adapted to provide support for said platform and to space said platform above a foundation or a structure on which the pallet rests, said body being constructed from predominantly one or more light weight materials having no or little inherent load bearing capacity;</p>
    <p num="p-0018">an external skin that is bonded to and envelopes the underside face of said platform and said supports and at least some of the upper side face of said platform, and</p>
    <p num="p-0019">a plurality of wear resistant members that are affixed to an underside of at least some of said supports and which are adapted in use to bear against a foundation upon which the pallet rests.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">Preferably the pallet is a rackable pallet and wherein the wear resistant members are bridges that extend between adjacent supports, said bridges being spaced from the underside of said platform and are adapted to provide support for the pallet when at least some of said bridges rest upon frame members of a rack.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">In still yet another aspect, this invention relates to a pallet having load bearing capabilities on which one or more articles may be placed for storage and/or transportation, including:</p>
    <p num="p-0022">a body having a platform that includes an upper side face upon which the article or articles may rest and a plurality of supports that depend from an underside face of said platform, said supports being adapted to provide support for said platform and to space said platform above a foundation or a structure on which the pallet rests, said body being constructed from predominantly one or more light weight materials having no or little inherent load bearing capacity;</p>
    <p num="p-0023">an external skin that is bonded to and envelopes the underside face of said platform and said supports and at least some of the upper side face of said platform, and</p>
    <p num="p-0024">a plurality of surface projections that depend from a lower face of at least some of said supports, said projections being adapted to engage a foundation, such as a conveyor.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">Preferably the engagement of the projections with the foundation is an interlocking engagement.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">Preferably, the pallet includes one or more foundation engaging members and wherein the surface projections are associated with said foundation engaging member or said foundation engaging members, and wherein the foundation engaging member or each foundation engaging member is attached to one or more supports. Further, it is preferred that the pallet is a rackable pallet and wherein the foundation engaging members are bridges that extend between adjacent supports, said bridges being spaced from the underside of said platform and are adapted to provide support for the pallet when at least some of said bridges rest upon frame members of a rack.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">The platform may be any suitable shape. However, in the preferred form of the invention the platform has a substantially square shape when viewed in plan.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">The upper side face of the platform may include at least one groove or channel formed therein that is adapted to receive a lower edge portion of a structural member or a side wall used in the construction of a package that is adapted to surround one or more articles to be stored and/or transported on said pallet.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">The supports are preferably arranged in rows such that a forklift tine is locatable between adjacent rows of supports. Further, it is preferred that the supports are arranged in longitudinally and transverse extending rows thus forming either a two way entry pallet or a four way entry pallet.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">The body may be constructed from a variety of light weight materials including cardboard, particle board, cellulosic fibre cement timber, various plastics materials and other porous or air permeable substances. However in the preferred embodiment the body is constructed from expanded polystyrene (EPS) and wherein the platform and the supports are formed integrally using a suitable moulding process.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">It is believed that the density of the expanded polystyrene used in the construction of the body will influence the strength of the pallet. In particular it is believed that the greater the density of the expanded polystyrene the greater the strength of the pallet.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">Further, it is believed that the extent to which the expanded beads used in the construction of the body fuse together also influences the strength of the pallet.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">It is also believed that the strength of the pallet is influenced by the extent to which the external skin bonds with the body. In particular it is believed that the greater the surface area of the external skin that is bonded to the body the greater the strength of the pallet.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">During the vacuum forming process, the heated skin is urged into contact with the body. In order that the heated skin may fuse with the body, preferably as much air or other gas trapped between the skin and the body is removed and wherein the extent to which the skin fuses with the body is influenced by the ability of the vacuum forming process to remove these gases.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">However, increasing the density of the expanded polystyrene used in the construction of the body will also inhibit the flow of air through the body during the vacuum forming process. To counter this, a plurality of cavities and/or openings are formed in the body. These preferably extend between the upper side of the platform and the underside of the platform and/or between the upper side of the platform and the underside of the supports.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">In the preferred embodiment, the expanded polystyrene has a density in the order of 28 kg/m3, and wherein the degree of fusion preferably is equal to or greater than 70%.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">It is also preferred that there are provided a plurality of openings or cavities formed in the platform having a diameter of approximately 3 mm, said openings being located between the supports. In the preferred embodiment the openings extend between the underside face and a point located just below the upper side face.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">The material from which the skin is made may include one or more of the following materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; polyester; styrene; polycarbonate; PET; APET; PETG; lead free PVC; copolymer polyester/polycarbonate; and HDPE.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">Preferably the external skin includes a bottom sheet that covers the supports and the underside face of the platform and a top sheet that covers the upper side face of the platform.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">In the preferred embodiment, the external skin is manufactured from high impact polystyrene, (HIPS), or a composite HIPS structure and wherein the top sheet is approximately 0.6 mm thick and the bottom sheet is 1.2 mm thick.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">It is also believed that the ability of the supports to resist compressive loads is greatly enhanced if each of the side walls includes a plurality of generally longitudinally extending ribs.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">The bridges may be manufactured from any suitable material. For example, the bridges may be constructed from wood, metal and/or various plastics materials, including lead free PVC. However, in the preferred embodiment, the bridges are manufactured from HIPS using an extrusion forming process.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">Further, the bridges may be configured so that they each span two or more supports of a row and are preferably affixed to the end walls of each of said supports so that they interconnect same.

    </description-of-drawings> <p num="p-0069"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> show a pallet <b>10</b> that is constructed in accordance with the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">The pallet <b>10</b> includes a body or blank <b>11</b>, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 15</figref>, comprising a multitude of high impact polystyrene beads that are fused together. Preferably the body <b>11</b> is formed using a two part mould and wherein the density of the beads is approximately 28 Kg/m3 and the level of fusion is at least 70%.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">The body <b>11</b> includes a platform <b>12</b>, having a substantially square shaped, generally flat, upper side face <b>13</b> and an opposing underside face <b>14</b>, and a plurality of supports <b>15</b> that depend from said underside face.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">The supports <b>15</b> are arranged in rows that extend both transversely and longitudinally across the surface of the underside face <b>14</b>. Further, the supports <b>15</b> include four corner supports <b>15</b> <i>a </i>that depend from a respective corner of the platform <b>12</b> and which have a substantially square shaped transverse cross-section. The corner supports <b>15</b> <i>a </i>each include two pairs of opposing, downwardly tapering, side walls <b>16</b> and an end wall <b>17</b> in which there is formed an <smallcaps>A</smallcaps>L@ shaped channel <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">The outer facing side walls <b>16</b> <i>a </i>and <b>16</b> <i>b </i>of each corner support <b>15</b> <i>a </i>include two grooves <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> respectively that are formed therein and which extend between the underside face <b>14</b> of the platform <b>12</b> and the end wall <b>17</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The inner facing side walls <b>16</b> <i>c </i>and <b>16</b> <i>d </i>of each corner support <b>15</b> <i>a </i>include three grooves <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> respectively that are formed therein and which extend between the underside face <b>14</b> of the platform <b>12</b> and the end wall <b>17</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">The supports <b>15</b> include four middle supports <b>15</b> <i>b </i>and wherein each middle support <b>15</b> <i>b </i>is located midway between two corner supports <b>15</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0076">Each middle support <b>15</b> <i>b </i>includes two pairs of opposing, downwardly tapering, side walls <b>24</b> and an end wall <b>25</b> in which there is formed a <smallcaps>A</smallcaps>T@ shaped channel <b>26</b>. The outer facing side wall <b>24</b> <i>a </i>and its opposing side wall <b>24</b> <i>b </i>each include two grooves <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> respectively that are formed therein and which extend between the underside face <b>14</b> of the platform <b>12</b> and the end wall <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The other two side walls <b>24</b> <i>c </i>and <b>24</b> <i>d </i>each include three grooves <b>29</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> respectively that are formed therein and which extend between the underside face <b>14</b> of the platform <b>12</b> and the end wall <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The grooves <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> are connected to opposing grooves <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> by three grooves <b>32</b> formed in the underside face <b>14</b> of the platform <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">The supports <b>15</b> also include a central support <b>15</b> <i>c </i>that depends from the centre of the platform <b>12</b>. The support <b>15</b> <i>c </i>has a substantially square shaped transverse cross-section and includes two pairs of opposing, downwardly tapering, side walls <b>33</b> and an end wall <b>34</b> in which there is formed a <smallcaps>A</smallcaps>cross@ shaped channel <b>35</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">The side walls <b>33</b> each include two grooves <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> formed therein which extend between the underside face <b>14</b> of the platform <b>12</b> and the end wall <b>34</b>. The grooves <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are connected to an opposing pair of grooves <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> by two grooves <b>38</b> formed in the underside face <b>14</b> of the platform <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">The grooves <b>38</b> divide the underside face <b>14</b> into essentially four quadrants <b>39</b> and wherein the underside face <b>14</b> of each quadrant <b>39</b> includes a series of five grooves <b>40</b> formed therein.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">The platform <b>12</b> also includes a matrix of cavities or bores <b>45</b> that surround each of the supports <b>15</b>. The bores are individually formed during the moulding process by a respective pin that is mounted on one part of the mould and wherein when the two parts of the mould are brought together, the pins extend into the mould cavity.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">Each bore <b>45</b> includes an open end <b>46</b> that opens to the underside face <b>14</b> and an opposing closed end <b>47</b> that lies just below the surface of the upper side face <b>13</b>. Further, the bores <b>45</b> are of substantially constant cross-section and, in the case of a pallet that is 1100 mm square, have a diameter of approximately 3 mm.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">The platform <b>12</b> also includes two opposing pairs of side walls <b>51</b>. Each side wall <b>51</b> is substantially rectangular in shape and includes a chamfered top edge portion <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">The supports <b>15</b> and the underside face <b>14</b> of the body <b>11</b> are preferably covered by a generally rectangularly shaped bottom sheet <b>60</b> made of lead free PVC. The sheet <b>60</b> is preferably of substantially uniform thickness, approximately 1.2 mm, and has a peripheral edge portion <b>61</b>. Further, the sheet <b>60</b> preferably has a substantially smooth outer face <b>62</b> and an opposing, substantially smooth, inner face <b>63</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">During construction of the pallet <b>10</b>, the pre-heated sheet <b>60</b> is brought in to contact with the end walls of the supports <b>15</b> and the peripheral edge portion <b>61</b> is clamped against abutting side walls <b>51</b> of the platform <b>12</b> using a tool or die, not shown. Then gases that are trapped between the sheet <b>60</b> and the underside face <b>14</b> are subsequently drawn through the body <b>11</b> thereby creating a partial vacuum between the underside face <b>14</b> and the sheet <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">The forces created by the partial vacuum both urge and, where necessary, stretch the sheet such that it bears against and becomes bonded to the side walls of the supports <b>15</b> and the underside face <b>14</b> of the body <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">It is believed that the bores <b>45</b>, because they are located adjacent each of the supports <b>15</b>, help ensure that the bottom sheet <b>60</b> bonds to the side walls of the supports <b>15</b> and those portions of the underside face <b>14</b> that are adjacent the supports <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">The clamping of the sheet <b>60</b> against the side walls <b>51</b> causes the portions of the sheet that are in contact with the side walls to bond with same.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">Preferably the manufacturing process involves the use of a tool that prevents the peripheral edge portion <b>61</b> of the sheet <b>60</b> from coming into contact with the side walls. Instead the peripheral edge portion <b>61</b> shall overlie yet diverge away from the side walls.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">Finally those portions of the bottom sheet <b>60</b> that are covering the openings of the bores <b>45</b> are each pierced using a respective retractable pin.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">The upper side face <b>13</b> of the body <b>11</b> is preferably covered by a generally rectangularly shaped top sheet <b>70</b> made of lead free PVC. The sheet <b>70</b> is preferably of substantially uniform thickness, approximately 0.6 mm, and has a peripheral edge portion <b>71</b>. Further, the sheet <b>70</b> preferably has a substantially smooth outer face <b>72</b> and an opposing, substantially smooth, inner face <b>73</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">During construction of the pallet <b>10</b>, the pre-heated sheet <b>70</b> is supported above the body <b>11</b> by a tool that is adapted to hold the peripheral edge <b>74</b> of said sheet. The body <b>11</b> is then advanced such that the upper side face <b>13</b> makes contact with the inner face <b>73</b> of the sheet <b>70</b> and whereupon any gases trapped between said inner face and said upper side face are drawn through the body <b>11</b>, aided by the inclusion of the bores <b>45</b>. The resulting partial vacuum forces the sheet <b>70</b> against the upper side face <b>13</b> ensuring that as much of said sheet as possible will bond with said face.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">The peripheral edge <b>74</b>, when released by the tool holding same, is then folded over and pressed against the exposed portions of the side walls <b>51</b> of the body <b>11</b>. Then, the peripheral edge portion <b>61</b> of the sheet <b>60</b> is folded over and heat bonded to the peripheral edge <b>74</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">The pallet <b>10</b> also includes a plurality of bridges <b>80</b> that extend between adjacent supports <b>15</b>, said bridges being spaced from the underside face of the platform by said support.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">The bridges <b>80</b> are each formed from an extruded plastics material, such as lead free PVC, and comprise a hollow core that extends the length of the member and one or interconnecting webs.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">The individual bridges <b>80</b> are adapted to be received in the various channels <b>18</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>35</b> formed in the end walls <b>17</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>34</b> respectively of the supports <b>15</b> and are preferably retained therein by friction and/or a suitable adhesive.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">The peripheral bridges <b>80</b> <i>a </i>are each provided with opposing mitred end portions <b>81</b>. Abutting end portions <b>81</b> of adjacent bridges <b>80</b> <i>a </i>are interconnected by a stake having opposing end portions that are frictionally retained within a respective bore.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">The three internal bridges <b>82</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>84</b> are preferably interconnected to one another where they meet at <b>85</b> and where the abut respective peripheral bridges <b>80</b> <i>a </i>at <b>86</b> using a suitable connector.</p>
    <p num="p-0100"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an end portion of a pallet <b>110</b> that is very similar to the pallet <b>10</b>. The pallet <b>110</b> includes a body <b>111</b> comprising a multitude of high impact polystyrene beads that are fused together.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">The body <b>111</b> includes a platform <b>112</b>, having a substantially square shaped, generally flat, upper side face <b>113</b> and an opposing underside face <b>114</b>, and a plurality of supports <b>115</b> that depend from said underside face. The supports <b>115</b> are arranged in rows that extend both longitudinally and transversely across the surface of the underside face <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">The platform <b>112</b> also includes two opposing pairs of side walls <b>151</b>. Each side wall <b>151</b> is substantially rectangular in shape and includes a groove <b>151</b> <i>a </i>that has been formed either during the moulding process used to produce the body <b>111</b> or subsequently pressed into said side wall <b>151</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">The supports <b>115</b> and the underside face <b>114</b> are covered by a generally rectangularly shaped sheet <b>160</b> made of lead free PVC and wherein the sheet <b>160</b> includes four peripheral edge portions <b>161</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">During construction of the pallet <b>110</b>, the pre-heated sheet <b>160</b> is brought into contact with the supports <b>115</b> and the peripheral edge portion <b>161</b> is clamped against abutting side walls <b>151</b> of the platform <b>112</b> using a tool, not shown. Then gases that are trapped between the sheet <b>160</b> and the underside face <b>114</b> are subsequently drawn through the body <b>111</b> thereby creating a partial vacuum between the underside face <b>114</b> and the sheet <b>160</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">The forces created by the partial vacuum both urge and, where necessary, stretch the sheet such that it bears against and becomes bonded to the side walls of the supports <b>115</b> and the underside face <b>114</b> of the body <b>111</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">The partial vacuum that is created also urges the sheet <b>160</b> to both conform to and bond with the side walls <b>151</b> of the platform <b>112</b>, including the grooves <b>151</b> <i>a</i>, but wherein a tool not shown prevents the peripheral edge portions <b>161</b> from making contact with the platform. Instead, the peripheral edge portions <b>161</b> each form a flap <b>200</b> that extends outwardly from the side walls <b>151</b> above the grooves <b>151</b> <i>a </i>at an inclined angle, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">The upper side face <b>113</b> of the body <b>111</b> is preferably covered by a generally rectangularly shaped top sheet <b>170</b> also made from a lead free PVC and wherein the sheet includes four peripheral edge portions <b>171</b>, each having a peripheral edge <b>174</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">During construction of the pallet <b>110</b>, the pre-heated sheet <b>170</b> is supported above the body <b>111</b> by a tool that is adapted to hold the peripheral edges <b>174</b> of said sheets. The body <b>111</b> is then advanced such that the upper side face <b>113</b> makes contact with the sheet <b>170</b> and whereupon any gases trapped between the sheet <b>170</b> and the upper side face <b>113</b> are drawn through the body <b>111</b>. The resulting partial vacuum forces the sheet <b>170</b> against the upper side face <b>113</b> ensuring that as much of said sheet as possible bonds with said face.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">Further, following trimming of the peripheral edges <b>174</b> of the sheet <b>170</b>, the partial vacuum also forces the edge portions <b>171</b> to both conform to and bond with the side walls <b>151</b> such that they cover an upper side face <b>201</b> and a lower side face <b>202</b> of an adjacent flap <b>200</b>, and wherein the tab <b>200</b> has a tendency to be drawn into an adjacent groove <b>151</b> <i>a</i>, as shown in dotted outline.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">It will be appreciated that the bridges <b>80</b> provide support for the pallet <b>10</b> when at least some of said bridges rest upon frame members of a rack.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">Further, it will be appreciated that the bridges <b>80</b> do not prevent the location of forklift tines between the underside face of the platform <b>12</b> and opposing bridges, and between opposing rows of supports <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">It will also be appreciated that the frame comprising a plurality of interconnected bridges <b>80</b> aids in preventing the splaying apart of the supports when heavy loads are placed on the pallet <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">It is also believed that the addition of grooves formed in the outer side faces of the supports <b>15</b> will strengthen the pallet <b>10</b>, and in particular the supports <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">It has also been observed that the size of the load that may be supported by the pallets <b>10</b> and <b>110</b> is influenced by the size of the bearing area, namely the size of the surface area of the end walls <b>17</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>34</b>. The greater the bearing area the greater the load that the pallets can support.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">In order to increase the bearing area and hence the load capacity of the pallets <b>10</b> and <b>110</b>, it is proposed that the distance separating adjacent supports be minimized. However it is understood that the minimum distance separating adjacent supports must be sufficient to enable two adjacent tines of a forklift or similar lifting apparatus to each pass simultaneously between adjacent rows of supports <b>15</b> and <b>115</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">Bearing the above in mind, it is proposed that the distance separating adjacent supports for most pallets be in the order of 80 mm.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">It will of course be realised that while the foregoing description has been given by way of example of this invention, all other modifications and variations thereto as would be apparent to persons skilled in the art are deemed to fall within the broad scope and ambit of this invention as herein defined in the appended claims.</p>
