The dialing memory <b>113</b>, dialing section <b>114</b>, transmitting/receiving section <b>115</b>, ring signal capturing section <b>122</b> and dialing pad <b>101</b> are also connected to the microprocessor <b>112</b> for operating the cellphone in a conventional manner, through the microprocessor <b>112</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">The cellphone of the entertainment and communication device <b>100</b> is of the type that is capable of making a wireless connection to the Internet for receiving data therefrom and transmitting data thereto, such as the Samsung® Model No. 3500, Qualcom® No. 1960, Sprint® PCS, or the like, without a hardwire connection through a personal computer or telephone line.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">The entertainment and communication device <b>100</b> of the present invention is provided with a socket <b>120</b> for receiving a replaceable memory card <b>200</b>. The opening for the socket <b>120</b> may be provided on the side of the device <b>100</b>, as shown at <b>120</b>A, or at one end of the device <b>100</b>, as shown at <b>120</b>B, or both. The memory card <b>200</b> is provided with electrical contacts <b>201</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which are adapted to engage corresponding electrical contacts (not shown) in the socket <b>120</b>, which contacts in turn are connected to the microprocessor <b>112</b> for communication between the replaceable memory card <b>200</b> and the microprocessor <b>112</b>. The memory card <b>200</b> may be a prerecorded card or a flash (blank) card suitable for recording data from the microprocessor <b>112</b>. By appropriately operating the cellphone to connect to or access the Internet and then operating the memory card control buttons <b>202</b>, data from the Internet may be recorded on the replaceable memory card <b>200</b>, such as musical performances, images (still or moving), written text or the like (hereinafter referred to as “data”). In addition to the audio data, the musical performance data from the Internet may include images of the performers or the like, and/or the words of the musical performance. Other audio and visual data also may be downloaded from the Internet to memory card <b>200</b>. Subsequent to the recordation of the musical performance or other data on the replaceable memory card <b>200</b> or upon the positioning of a prerecorded memory card <b>200</b> in a socket <b>120</b>, the memory card control buttons <b>202</b> may be manipulated to reproduce the musical performance or other data with the sound being broadcast by the speaker <b>125</b> or to earphones (not shown) connected to the earphone jack <b>121</b> or transmitted to wireless earphones (not shown).

The images and/or words included in the recording on a memory card <b>200</b> will be displayed on the display panel <b>104</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">The memory card <b>200</b> is preferably of a high memory capacity and a size to fit substantially inside the housing of the device <b>100</b> so as not to protrude therefrom and yet be of substantially the full width of the device <b>100</b> to maximize the memory capacity of the card <b>200</b> substantially beyond the memory capacity of conventional prerecorded memory cards, such as for MP3 players. Of course, the width of the device <b>100</b> is limited from a practical standpoint to a width that is comfortable in the palm of an adult person's hand for use as a telephone. Thus, as a practical matter, the width of the memory card is limited to about 1½″ to 2″. Similarly, the overall size of the device <b>100</b> must be sufficiently small to be comfortably carried in a pocket or purse to be most practical. Further, while the thickness of the card <b>200</b> may be increased somewhat for increasing the memory capacity there is also a practical limit to that increased thickness so that the thickness of the device <b>100</b> does not become excessive, but it is contemplated that memory cards <b>200</b> of about twice the thickness may be provided and interchangeably installed in the socket <b>120</b> for at least doubling the memory capacity or separate sockets, such as sockets <b>120</b>A and <b>120</b>B, may be provided for accommodating memory cards <b>200</b> of different thicknesses. Still further, the length of the device <b>100</b> is limited to a practical length and, therefore, the vertical length of the card is similarly limited. The card <b>200</b> and socket <b>120</b> may be provided with matching non-symmetrical shapes, grooves, ridges or the like for requiring the card <b>200</b> to be inserted into the socket in the correct orientation, such as the cutoff corner of card <b>200</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (lower left) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (lower right). The device <b>100</b> may also be provided with an integral image and audio storage memory <b>116</b> connected to the microprocessor for temporary or permanent storage of data, in addition to data storage on cards <b>200</b>, and the data stored on memory <b>116</b> may be reproduced in the same manner as from replaceable memory cards <b>200</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">Referring more particularly to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a latching device, generally designated <b>150</b>, is shown for retaining the replaceable memory card <b>200</b> in the socket <b>120</b>A and for facilitating the removal of the memory card <b>200</b> from the socket <b>120</b>A. The latching device <b>150</b> includes a lever <b>152</b> pivotally connected at <b>154</b> to the back of the housing of the device <b>100</b>, with a tab <b>156</b> extending along the side of the device and over a portion of the socket <b>120</b>A in the closed position. A pin <b>158</b> extends inwardly from the lever <b>152</b> and engages a hole <b>204</b> in the memory card <b>200</b>. When the latching device <b>150</b> is pivoted to the open position shown in dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the memory card <b>200</b> may be readily removed from socket <b>120</b>A by placing a finger on the portion of the card <b>200</b> exposed by opening the latching device <b>150</b> or by engaging the hole <b>204</b> with a finger nail or a pointed implement, such as a pencil or pen. Further, the pin <b>158</b> and hole can be sized and relatively positioned such that the pin <b>158</b> urges the card <b>200</b> outwardly upon opening the latching device. Still further, the socket <b>120</b>A may be provided with a spring for urging the card <b>200</b> outwardly as soon as the card is unlatched. Of course either the tab <b>156</b> or pin <b>158</b> may be omitted since the other (pin or tab, respectively) will retain the card <b>200</b> in the socket <b>120</b>A. The latching device <b>150</b> may be of a width to only cover a portion of the socket <b>120</b>A, as shown, or of a width to cover the entire socket (not shown).</p>
  <p num="p-0017">Since the device <b>100</b> can be wirelessly connected to the internet, it is also possible to use the device <b>100</b> for any other Internet functions, such as sending and receiving e-mail, conducting ebusiness, etc. Further, in view of the recording capability of the device <b>100</b>, the telephone conversations on the cellphone may be selectively recorded (one or both sides) and the device can be used for any sound recording, such as for dictation or face-to-face conversations or conferences. Still further, the microprocessor <b>112</b> includes means for automatically interrupting the playing of any musical performance being reproduced on the device <b>100</b> when a telephone call is placed or received on the cellphone until the call is completed.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">All of the aforedescribed functions and those described hereinafter are powered by a battery means (not shown) in the device <b>100</b> which preferably is a single rechargeable battery.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">The entertainment and communication device <b>100</b> is also provided with a computer jack <b>124</b> connected to the microprocessor for selectively connecting the device <b>100</b> directly to a computer, radio, television or CD, DVD, VCR, tape or phonograph record player (not shown) by a hard wire (not shown) for downloading and uploading (where appropriate) to and from the replaceable memory card <b>200</b> or fixed memory <b>116</b> in the device <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">The entertainment and communication device <b>100</b> is also provided with various other features for the personal entertainment, communication, security, safety and the like of the person at all times that the person has the device <b>100</b> with him or her. A video camera <b>102</b> is connected through an image signal processing section <b>107</b> to the microprocessor <b>112</b> and the camera operation is controlled by button <b>105</b>, whereby images may be displayed on the panel <b>104</b>, recorded on either the integral memory <b>116</b> or the replaceable memory card <b>200</b>, or transmitted by the cellphone to a remote telephone which may be located at a police station, security office, one's own personal computer or the like. The video camera <b>102</b> is preferably a digital camera for electronically capturing images, either still or moving, for minimizing the size and battery power requirements, but also may be an analog type camera. Similarly, an infrared night vision camera <b>106</b> may be provided and connected to the microprocessor <b>112</b> through an infrared image processing section <b>109</b> to record or transmit images in the same manner as video camera <b>102</b>, and a light sensor <b>118</b> is connected to the microprocessor <b>112</b> for automatically selecting the operation of the night vision <b>106</b> when the ambient light is at a very low level. Cameras <b>102</b> and <b>106</b> will be referred to generically as a “camera”. The microphone <b>103</b> may also be activated manually or automatically by the microprocessor <b>112</b> when either of the cameras <b>102</b> or <b>106</b> are activated for recording and/or transmitting sounds within the range of the device <b>100</b> synchronously with the recording or transmission of images by one of the cameras.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">The entertainment and communication device also includes various emergency features for use by the person carrying the device. An alarm button <b>123</b> is provided and may be activated to produce an audible alarm from the speaker <b>125</b> for dissuading an attacker or intruder or activating a silent alarm whereby the cellphone is automatically operated to communicate the emergency condition to a remote telephone, such as by dialing “911” or a private security telephone number or the like. Similarly, one or more sensors <b>110</b>, such as motion, infrared, ultrasonic, acceleration, sound, light, heat, smoke, carbon monoxide, poisonous gas or the like sensors, are provided with the device <b>100</b> and selectively activated for providing either an audible or silent alarm, similar to the functions of the panic alarm button <b>123</b> but without requiring operator activation, and the sensors <b>110</b> are connected through the sensor reading section <b>111</b> to the microprocessor <b>112</b> for using any of the functions of the device <b>100</b>. For example, with the acceleration sensor of sensors <b>110</b> activated while a person has the device <b>100</b> in an automobile, the sudden deceleration of the automobile in an accident condition would be sensed by the acceleration sensor to cause the microprocessor <b>112</b> to dial an appropriate telephone number stored in the dialing memory <b>113</b>, such as a “911” or a vehicle rescue number, and transmit the emergency as well as the location of the device <b>100</b> as determined by a global positioning satellite (GPS) reading section <b>117</b> provided with the device, which GPS reading section <b>117</b> may also be activated by the panic alarm <b>123</b>. Further, if the motion sensor or similar sensors <b>110</b> are activated and the device <b>100</b> is appropriately positioned, for example in a hotel room, the motion and/or presence of an intruder will be sensed and communicated through the sensor reading section <b>111</b> to the microprocessor <b>112</b> to activate any desired function, such as an audible alarm from the speaker <b>125</b>, an automatic dialing of a “911” number, operation of electronic camera <b>102</b> or infrared camera <b>106</b>, operation of the microphone <b>103</b>, operation of the GPS reading section <b>117</b> or the like. Similar functions can be performed by the device <b>100</b> when any of the other sensors are activated to sense a particular condition, such as heat, smoke, carbon monoxide, poisonous gas or the like. AM/FM radio receivers can optionally be included for entertainment when the alarm system is not in use.
