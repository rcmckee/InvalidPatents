    <heading>FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention relates to a sod harvester which, after harvesting sod, can pick up the cut sod and stack it, and to methods relating to sod harvesting.</p>
    <heading>INTRODUCTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Sod harvesters for cutting a strip of sod from the ground and for stacking the sod as a set of slabs on a receiving surface (typically a pallet) have existed for many years. However, prior harvesters which have included a mechanism for automatically stacking slabs of sod on a pallet have been extremely complex and costly. One problem has been that since the strip of sod is normally cut and delivered continuously from the ground, a buffer storage must be provided on the sod harvester to receive sod which continues to be delivered from the cutting knife at the same time when sod which has previously been cut is to be picked up and stacked or moved to another location. The provision of buffer storage for the sod until it can be picked up has in the past added to the size, cost and complexity of the harvester.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p num="p-0005">In one aspect the present invention provides a method of harvesting and handling sod comprising the steps of cutting an elongated sod slab and cutting said sod slab into two sod sections, but leaving uncut at least one small sod connection between said two sod sections, thereby to tie together said sod sections in a stack containing said sod sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">In some examples, the method includes the step of leaving at least two small sod connections between said two sod sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">In some examples, the two sod connections are at the outer edges of said sod sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">In some examples, the two sod connections are spaced inwardly from the outer edges of said sod sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In some examples, the method includes the step of the step of cutting is performed by a cross-cut knife while said sod is in the ground and before it has been undercut and side cut.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In some examples, the step of cutting is performed by a cross-cut knife while said sod is resting on a conveyor of a sod harvester.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">In accordance with another aspect, a sod harvester includes a sod cutting knife for cutting slabs of sod from the ground. The sod slabs having opposing side edges separated by a slab width. The sod harvester also includes a conveyor mechanism, for carrying the slabs of sod away from the sod cutting knife to a first location, and a sod pick-up mechanism for picking up the sod from the first location and moving such sod to a second location. The sod pick-up mechanism can then return to the first location again to pick up sod at the first location. The sod pick-up mechanism comprising a sod carrier is movable between the first and second locations. The sod harvester also includes at least one cross-cut knife selectably operable to cut across the slab width to divide each sod slab into at least two slab sections. The cross-cut knife comprises a cutting edge having at least one notch defined in the cutting edge. The at least one notch is adapted to leave at least one sod connection between the two slab sections to tie together the sod sections in a stack containing the sod sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">In some examples, the cross-cut knife is disposed on the sod pick-up mechanism and is operable to cut sod slabs provided in the first location.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In some examples, the at least one notch comprises two, spaced apart notches to leave two, spaced apart sod connections between the two slab sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">In some examples, the at least one notch comprises a notch height that is greater than a thickness of the sod slab being cut so that each sod connection remains uncut by the cross-cut knife.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">In some examples, the at least one notch comprises a notch height that is less than a thickness of the sod slab being cut so that each sod connection is partially cut, but not severed, by the cross-cut knife.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">In some examples, the sod harvester also includes at least one additional cutting edge portion that is selectably movable relative to the at least one notch between a first position, in which the additional cutting edge portion is separate from the at least one notch and does not contact the slab, and a second position, in which the additional cutting edge portion fills in the at least one notch thereby extending the cutting edge across the entire knife width and enabling the cross-cut knife to completely sever the two slab portions.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">In some examples, the cross-cut knife is provided forward of the sod cutting knife and is adapted to cut across the slab width while the sod slab is in the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">In some examples, the at least one cross-cut knife includes a first cross-cut knife and a second cross-cut knife. The first and second cross-cut knives spaced apart to cut across the width of one sod slab at first and second cross-cut positions spaced apart along a length of the sod slab. The first and second cross-cut knives are configured to divide the sod slab into three slab sections with at least one sod connection remaining uncut between adjacent slab sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">In accordance with another aspect, a sod harvester includes a sod cutting knife for cutting slabs of sod from the ground. The sod slabs have opposing side edges separated by a slab width. The sod harvester also includes a conveyor mechanism for carrying the slabs of sod away from the sod cutting knife to a first location. The sod harvester also includes a sod pick-up mechanism for picking up the sod from the first location and moving such sod to a second location and for then returning to the first location again to pick up sod at the first location. The sod pick-up mechanism includes a sod carrier movable between the first and second locations. The sod harvester also includes at least one cross-cut knife that is selectably operable to cut across the slab width to divide each sod slab into at least two slab sections. The cross-cut knife has a knife width. The cross-cut knife comprises a cutting edge having a cutting edge width that is less than the knife width. The cutting edge leaves at least one sod connection between the two slab sections to tie together the sod sections in a stack containing the sod sections, wherein the at least one sod connection is located at the side edge of the slab.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">In some examples, the cutting edge comprises a central portion of the knife width and defines a first recess at a first side of the cross-cut knife and a second recess at an opposing second side of the cross-cut knife, and the at least one sod connection comprises first and second sod connections left by the first and second recesses.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">In some examples, at least one of the first and second recesses has a respective recess height that is greater than a thickness of the sod slab being cut so that each sod connection remains uncut by the cross-cut knife.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">In some examples, at least one of the first and second recesses has a respective recess height that is less than a thickness of the sod slab being cut so that each sod connection is partially cut, but not severed, by the cross-cut knife.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">In some examples, the sod harvester also includes at least one additional cutting edge portion corresponding to each recess. The additional cutting edge portions are selectably movable relative to the corresponding recess between a first position, in which the additional cutting edge portion is separate from the corresponding recess and does not contact the slab, and a second position, in which the additional cutting edge portion fills in the corresponding recess thereby extending the cutting edge across the entire knife width and enabling the cross-cut knife to completely sever the two slab portions.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0109">Reference is first made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which shows a simplified diagrammatic view of a sod harvester <b>10</b> according to the invention. The sod harvester <b>10</b> is intended to be pulled by a towing vehicle, e.g. a tractor (not shown), but it will be appreciated that a sod harvester according to the invention can be self-propelled, or it can be mounted directly on the side of a tractor, as is well known in the field.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">The harvester <b>10</b> is intended to cut slabs of sod and to stack the slabs in flat condition on a pallet, as contrasted with sod harvesters which produce rolls of sod. Preferably, the sod harvester <b>10</b> cuts side-by-side strips of sod of sufficient total width to constitute an entire single layer on the pallet, so as to simplify stacking the cut slabs of sod on the pallet (as will be explained). Typically, therefore, the harvester <b>10</b> may have three vibrating sod cutting knives <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>3</b> (best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which undercut and side cut three side-by-side strips of sod <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). Rollers <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>16</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>16</b>-<b>3</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) ahead of the cutting knives roll the sod before the sod is cut, and vertically moving cross-cut knives <b>18</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>18</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>18</b>-<b>3</b> positioned ahead of the rollers are driven into the ground at desired intervals to cut the strips of sod into lengths (i.e. into pieces or slabs of soil). Conventional fingers <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> attached to and extending rearwardly from the cutting knives guide the cut sod onto conveyors (to be described) of the sod harvester. Conventional means, not shown, are provided to lift the cutting knives and rollers above the ground when they are not being used for cutting, so that the harvester <b>10</b> can travel.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">The vibrating sod cutting knives, rollers, cross-cut knives and fingers have all been well-known in the industry for many years and are shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,509,944 issued May 5, 1970.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">It is desirable that the three strips of sod <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> cut by harvester <b>10</b> be located closely adjacent each other from a side-by-side perspective, with minimal lateral gaps between them, so as not to leave narrow uncut (and wasted) strips of sod in the field being cut. Therefore, preferably the center sod cutting knife <b>12</b>-<b>2</b> and its associated roller <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> and cross-cut knife <b>18</b>-<b>2</b> are offset forwardly of the two outer sod cutting knives and rollers, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. With this arrangement, the two outer knives and their associated mechanisms can be moved laterally inwardly toward the center sod cutting knife <b>12</b>-<b>2</b> to minimize or to reduce to zero any gaps between adjacent sod strips. (In some sod growing areas, where after harvesting sod is regrown from pieces of sod left in the field, then very narrow “ribbons” of uncut sod may be left between adjacent cut strips, to assist in regrowth of new sod after harvesting.)</p>
    <p num="p-0113">In a typical harvester version, the center sod cutting knife <b>12</b>-<b>2</b> may be located, e.g. eight inches in front of the two outer sod cutting knives <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>3</b>, but this distance can be varied and different offset patterns can be used if desired. In the version shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fingers <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> extending rearwardly from the center sod cutting knife <b>12</b>-<b>2</b> are longer than the fingers <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> of the two outer knives, to guide the cut sod onto the conveyors described below.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4E</figref>, the harvester <b>10</b> includes three sequential sets of conveyors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to move the cut sod pieces from the cutting knives rearwardly to a location from which the cut sod pieces can be picked up and transferred to a pallet or other desired support.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">The first set of conveyors <b>30</b> includes two side-by-side conveyors <b>30</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>2</b> driven at slightly greater than ground speed (ground speed being the speed at which the machine travels over the ground) by a hydraulic motor diagrammatically indicated at <b>33</b>. The first set of conveyors <b>30</b> can consist of a single conveyor, or it can consist of three or four side-by-side conveyors (any number can be used), but two side-by-side conveyors <b>30</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>2</b> have been found convenient from a production viewpoint. The conveyors <b>30</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>2</b> both operate at the same speed, and since they carry the cut sod upwardly at a relatively steep angle, elongated fingers <b>35</b>, pivotably mounted on a bridge <b>36</b> extending across the conveyors <b>30</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>2</b>, are positioned to lie against the cut sod strips as the sod travels upwardly, to reduce slippage of the sod on the conveyors <b>30</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>2</b> and to prevent the leading edges of the cut sod strip from curling back downhill. As is well-known in the industry, the speed of hydraulic motor <b>33</b> is controlled by a hydraulic circuit (indicated at <b>145</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) which reads ground speed from a conventional sensor <b>200</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">The second set of conveyors <b>32</b> also consist of two side-by-side conveyors <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>32</b>-<b>2</b> (although again, any desired number can be used). Again, elongated fingers <b>38</b> are provided, pivotably mounted on a bridge <b>40</b> extending across the second set of conveyors <b>32</b>, to overlie the sod strips as they travel up the second conveyor set <b>32</b>, again to reduce slippage of the sod on the second conveyors and to prevent the leading edges of the sod strips from curling back. The second set of conveyors are driven in unison by a hydraulic motor diagrammatically indicated at <b>42</b>, preferably at approximately twice ground speed. Thus, when the sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> reach the second set of conveyors <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the sod strips will be accelerated away from the sod strips on the first set of conveyors <b>30</b>, leaving a gap indicated at <b>44</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, for a reason to be described.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">From the second set of conveyors <b>32</b>, the three side-by-side sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> next travel onto the third conveyor set <b>34</b>, which consists of three side-by-side conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>3</b>, one to accommodate each sod strip. In one embodiment, exemplified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the outer third conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> are each divided into two sub-conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a</i>, <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> <i>b </i>and <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> <i>a</i>, <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> <i>b</i>. The sub-conveyors of each side conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> are linked by a chain and sprocket mechanism <b>46</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) so that only one of the two sub-conveyors need be driven to drive both sub-conveyors of an outer conveyor. The division of each side third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> into two sub-conveyors provides a gap or depression <b>48</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>48</b>-<b>3</b> in the center of the top rear of these conveyors, to accommodate a cross-cut knife as will be explained.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">Since there may not be space to divide the center third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> into two sub-conveyors, the center third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, has a center depression <b>50</b> provided by three rollers <b>52</b>, to accommodate a cross-cut blade if a cross-cut is needed.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">In some instances, gaps and depressions provided between sub-conveyors, such as for example gaps <b>48</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>48</b>-<b>3</b> and depression <b>50</b>, can become fouled or clogged with dirt and other debris that is produced by the cross-cutting of the sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b>. The amount of excess dirt and debris generated by the cross-cutting process, for example using knife <b>146</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> or knife <b>584</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49-50E</figref>, can be affected by several factors including the design of the cross-cut knife, the type of sod being harvested, the soil conditions and the weather conditions.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">In some examples, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, the third conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> can each be a single, continuous conveyor and need not include gaps or depressions to accommodate a cross-cut knife. Eliminating the gaps and depressions between conveyor portions can eliminate the related problem of the gaps and depressions being filled or fouled with dirt as a result of cross-cutting, or other contamination.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">In such examples, instead of providing a gap for receiving the cross-cut knife, for example knife <b>146</b> or <b>584</b>, the third conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> provide a generally continuous conveyor surface that can act as an anvil surface to oppose the cutting edge of the cross-cut knife <b>146</b>, <b>584</b>. The third conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> can be formed from any suitable material that is flexible enough to act as a conveyor and strong or resilient enough to act as an anvil surface for the cross-cut knife, including, for example, rubber. The material of the third conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> and the profile of the cutting edge of the cross-cut knife <b>146</b>, <b>584</b> are selected so that the useful service life of the third conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> is not substantially reduced by the repeated contact from the cross-cut knife.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">In other examples, the cross-cut knife <b>146</b>, <b>584</b> can be operated so that it penetrates substantially the entire thickness of the sod strip <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b>, but does not contact the third conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> with sufficient force to damage the conveyor surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">Each third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> is driven separately by a hydraulic motor <b>60</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>60</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>60</b>-<b>3</b>. All three third set conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> preferably operate at approximately three times ground speed, thus accelerating the sod strips away from the sod strips following behind them on the second set conveyors <b>32</b> and producing a gap <b>62</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>) between the trailing edges of the sod strips on the third set conveyors and the leading edges of the sod strips on the second set conveyors. The gap <b>62</b> is typically larger than the gap <b>44</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">In the operation of the sod harvester <b>10</b> as so far described, the three strips of sod <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> are cut by cutting knives <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>12</b>-<b>3</b> and cross-cut knives <b>18</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>18</b>-<b>3</b> and travel up the first and second conveyor sets <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4C</figref>. Since the center cutting knife <b>12</b>-<b>2</b> and cross-cut knife <b>18</b>-<b>2</b> are positioned ahead of the two side knives, the center sod strip <b>14</b>-<b>2</b> will be cut and released from the ground first and therefore its leading edge <b>64</b>-<b>2</b> on first conveyor set <b>30</b> will be ahead of (i.e. offset from) the leading edges <b>64</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>64</b>-<b>3</b> of the two side sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). This offset of leading edge <b>64</b>-<b>2</b> continues on the second set conveyors <b>32</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0125">When the sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> reach the third set conveyors <b>34</b>, they are accelerated onto those conveyors until their respective trailing edges <b>66</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>66</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>66</b>-<b>3</b> pass individual sensors <b>70</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for each third set conveyor. The sensors <b>70</b> each consist of a tongue <b>72</b> which rests on its associated third set conveyor and is attached at rotary connection <b>74</b> to a microswitch <b>76</b>. When a sod strip on a third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> or <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> passes out from under the tongue <b>72</b>, the tongue <b>72</b> drops slightly (by the thickness of the sod strip), operating the microswitch <b>76</b>. The three microswitches <b>76</b> are connected to a computer (to be discussed) which then shuts off the third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> or <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> in question until the start of the next cycle (as will be described). The result of this individual control of the third set conveyors <b>34</b> is that all three strips of sod <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> are automatically positioned on the third set conveyors <b>34</b> with their leading edges aligned (and therefore also with their trailing edges aligned), as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> (even though previously the leading edge <b>64</b>-<b>2</b> of the center sod strip <b>14</b>-<b>2</b> was ahead of the other two leading edges).</p>
    <p num="p-0126">The third set conveyors <b>34</b> acts as a storage or buffer set of conveyors, providing a location from which the sod strips can be picked up and transferred to a pallet. The gap <b>62</b> between the leading edges of the sod strips advancing up the second conveyor set <b>32</b>, and the trailing edges of the sod strips located on the third conveyor set <b>34</b>, provides a time period or time interval during which the sod strips on the third conveyor set <b>34</b> can be picked up and transferred to a pallet or other stacking location (or at least can be picked up and moved away from the third conveyor set) before the next set of sod strips arrives at the third conveyor set.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">A preferred mechanism for picking up the sod strips, moving them over a pallet, and depositing them on the pallet will next be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and following. As there shown, the harvester <b>10</b> has a sod pick-up and transfer mechanism <b>80</b>. Mechanism <b>80</b> includes a gantry arrangement which comprises a guide frame <b>82</b> fixedly mounted on the harvester <b>10</b>, and a gantry <b>84</b> mounted on the guide frame <b>82</b> by wheels <b>86</b> (one at each corner of the gantry) so that the gantry can roll back and forth in a side-to-side direction on the frame <b>82</b>, with the wheels <b>86</b> supported and guided in channels <b>88</b> at the sides of the guide frame <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">The guide frame <b>82</b> extends over the third set conveyors <b>34</b> and also extends over a pallet <b>90</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) supported on a forklift <b>92</b> located at one side of the third set conveyors <b>34</b>. A sod carrier <b>94</b> is suspended from the gantry <b>84</b> and serves to pick-up the sod from the third set conveyors <b>34</b>, after which (as will be described) the gantry <b>84</b> travels laterally to a position over the pallet <b>90</b>. The sod carrier <b>94</b> then deposits its layer of sod on the pallet <b>90</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">The sod carrier <b>94</b> includes side and end frame members <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> defining a frame for the sod carrier, and also includes upper frame members <b>100</b> spanning the side frame members <b>96</b> and connected thereto. A cross frame member <b>102</b> extends between the upper frame members <b>100</b> and supports half <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> of a ball joint <b>104</b>. The other half <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> of ball joint <b>104</b> is connected to a cross member <b>106</b> in the gantry <b>84</b>, so that the sod carrier <b>94</b> is suspended from the gantry <b>84</b> and is able to rock and tilt to a limited extent relative to the gantry <b>84</b>, and is also able to rotate with respect to the gantry <b>84</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">A rotate piston and cylinder <b>110</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is connected between a frame member of the gantry <b>84</b> and the sod carrier <b>94</b>, the attachment point on the sod carrier being spaced from ball joint <b>104</b>. The piston and cylinder <b>110</b> is connected so that it can rotate the sod carrier <b>94</b> on the gantry <b>84</b> by 90° when commanded to do so. (Alternatively, a conventional rotary actuator can be used to rotate the sod carrier on the gantry.)</p>
    <p num="p-0131">The gantry <b>84</b> is moved on guide frame <b>82</b> between a first position over the third set conveyors <b>34</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) and a second position over the pallet <b>90</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) by an elongated double-acting (two-ended) cylinder <b>112</b> which is mounted at <b>114</b> on upper frame member <b>106</b> of the gantry <b>84</b>. An elongated piston rod <b>118</b> extends through the cylinder <b>112</b> and is mounted at both ends, at <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, to the guide frame <b>82</b>. A piston (not shown) is located in the cylinder <b>112</b>, so that as hydraulic fluid is injected into the cylinder <b>112</b> at either end (by hoses not shown), the cylinder <b>112</b> will travel back and forth in the direction of arrow <b>124</b>, carrying the gantry <b>84</b> with it, to move the gantry between the two positions described (one over the third set conveyors <b>34</b> and the other over the pallet <b>90</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0132">The sod carrier <b>94</b> suspended from the gantry <b>84</b> is essentially the same as that shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/780,616, filed Feb. 19, 2004 entitled “Method and Apparatus for Picking Up Sod from the Top”, published Jan. 6, 2005, the description and drawings of which are incorporated by reference herein. Since the sod pick-up features of the sod carrier <b>94</b> are fully described and illustrated in such published patent application, those features will be described only briefly here. Specifically, the sod carrier <b>94</b> includes (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>A) a number of pairs of clamps <b>130</b> which extend parallel to each other at the bottom of the sod carrier <b>94</b>. The clamps <b>130</b> are strongly biased to a closed position by springs <b>132</b> but can be opened by a linkage <b>134</b> (not shown in detail in this application) which is operated by a piston and cylinder <b>136</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">In operation, as described, three sod strips travel up the first and second conveyor sets <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and onto the third conveyor set <b>34</b>. Since the three sod strips are not usually perfectly aligned (as mentioned, the middle sod strip is ahead of the two side sod strips, and the two side sod strips may slip unequally on the conveyors), each conveyor of the third conveyor set is separately driven and controlled (as described) to shut off individually when its sod strip is properly positioned on the third conveyor in question. This ensures that all three sod strips on the third conveyor set are aligned evenly with each other and ready to be picked up. If the sod is defective, the operator can manually override (using a manual control, not shown) the sensors which normally stop the third conveyor set <b>34</b> and can cause the third conveyor set <b>34</b> to continue operating, thus ejecting the defective sod pieces onto the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the third conveyor set <b>34</b> is mounted in a bed frame <b>140</b> which can be raised and lowered using piston and cylinder sets <b>142</b> at each side of the bed frame (and with additional conventional guides, not shown). When the three sod strips are aligned on the third conveyor set <b>34</b>, thus shutting off all of the third conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>3</b> as previously described, a computer <b>144</b> (described below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) sends a signal to operate the pistons and cylinders <b>142</b> (part of hydraulic circuit <b>145</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), raising the conveyor bed frame <b>140</b> and pressing the sod strips on the third conveyor set <b>34</b> against the clamps <b>130</b> on the underside of the sod carrier <b>94</b>. At this time, the sod carrier <b>94</b> is pushed against the gantry <b>84</b>, and the pressure is transmitted to the gantry by rubber pads <b>95</b> atop the sod carrier and which press against the underside of the gantry. Besides absorbing pressure when the sod carrier <b>94</b> is pushed against the gantry <b>84</b>, the rubber pads <b>95</b> serve an additional purpose. If the sod strips on the third conveyor set <b>34</b> happen to be of uneven thickness, e.g. thicker at one side of the third conveyor set than the other, then the rubber pads <b>95</b>, together with the limited rocking and tilting permitted by ball joint <b>104</b>, permit the sod carrier <b>94</b> to tilt to compensate at least to some extent for the uneven thickness, allowing the clamps <b>130</b> to clamp all of the sod strips on the third conveyor set <b>34</b>, rather than failing to clamp some of the sod strips.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">If it is desired to cut the sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> each into two shorter pieces, a knife <b>146</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>) or <b>584</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49-50E</figref>) can be fixed in the underside of sod carrier <b>94</b> as described in the above-mentioned published pending application, thus dividing each sod strip <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> into two parts. The computer <b>144</b> typically operates control solenoids valves <b>147</b> in the hydraulic circuit <b>145</b> to operate the pistons and cylinders described. The pressure with which the conveyor bed frame <b>140</b> presses the sod strips on the third conveyor set <b>34</b> against the clamps <b>130</b> is preferably made adjustable, to allow better gripping of the sod by the clamps when the sod is of different soil types. (For example, for tough soil, a higher pressure is needed.)</p>
    <p num="p-0136">The pressure with which the bed frame <b>140</b>, and hence the sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> are pressed against the underside of the sod carrier <b>94</b> is sensed by a pressure sensor <b>148</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) connected to one of the piston and cylinders <b>142</b> which raise the bed <b>140</b>. When the pressure is sufficiently high, this is detected by the computer <b>144</b> which then sends a signal to a solenoid valve controlling the clamp piston and cylinder <b>136</b>, depressurizing this piston and cylinder and allowing the springs <b>132</b> to snap the clamps <b>130</b> closed. The clamps <b>130</b> then grip the sod by its blades, as described in the above published co-pending application. In some cases, if the equipment is likely to operate over muddy ground and if the mud may clog the clamps <b>130</b> and prevent them from gripping the sod strips properly, a series of hooks <b>150</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) may be added to the clamps, to provide improved grip by the sod carrier <b>94</b> on the sod strips. The hooks <b>150</b> are relatively short and will not support the sod strips by themselves, so that when the clamps <b>130</b> are opened, the sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> (which are heavy) will quickly drop away from the sod carrier <b>94</b>. (If a sufficient number of closely spaced hooks <b>150</b> are used, then these hooks are capable of supporting the sod strips by themselves and can in effect constitute a clamp. When the hooks are separated by the clamp opening action, then the heavy sod strips will drop away from the hooks <b>150</b>.) Alternatively, the clamps can be formed as a series of straight or curved fingers.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">After sufficient time has been provided for the clamps <b>130</b> to close and to grip the sod strips (typically only a very short time will be required for this), the computer <b>144</b> sends a signal to a solenoid valve in the hydraulic circuit <b>145</b> controlling pistons and cylinders <b>142</b> to lower the conveyor bed frame <b>140</b> so that the third conveyors will be in position to receive the next set of sod strips when they arrive from the second conveyor set <b>32</b>. The computer <b>144</b> then also sends a signal to activate the gantry travel cylinder <b>112</b>. The gantry <b>84</b> then moves to the right as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> until the gantry <b>84</b> with the sod carrier <b>94</b> and the sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> suspended therefrom is over the pallet <b>90</b>. At this point, a proximity sensor <b>152</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) on the guide frame <b>82</b> operates, sending a signal to the computer <b>144</b> which then stops the operation of cylinder <b>112</b>, ending further lateral travel of the gantry <b>84</b>. At the same time (or a few milliseconds later) the computer <b>144</b> sends a signal to the hydraulic circuit <b>145</b> to operate the clamp piston and cylinder <b>136</b> to open the clamps <b>130</b>, thus allowing the sod strips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> which were suspended from the sod carrier <b>94</b> to drop onto the pallet <b>90</b>. After this operation has occurred, the computer <b>144</b> signals the hydraulic circuit <b>145</b> to operate gantry cylinder <b>112</b> in the opposite direction, to return the gantry and the sod carrier to the position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 9A</figref>, over the third conveyor set <b>34</b> and ready to pick-up another set of sod strips. A proximity sensor <b>153</b> at the other (home) end of guide frame <b>82</b> signals the computer <b>144</b> to stop this return gantry movement when the gantry <b>84</b> has returned to its starting (home) position. It will be realized that instead of, or in addition to, raising the conveyor bed frame <b>140</b>, the sod carrier <b>94</b> can be lowered so that the sod strips are contacted by the clamps <b>130</b> which press against the sod strips on the third conveyor set <b>34</b>, to then lift the sod strips.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">When a pallet <b>90</b> is being loaded with sod strips or slabs, then after a number of layers have been deposited with the sod strips oriented in one direction, additional layers can be deposited with the sod strips oriented at 90° to the first direction, to tie together the load of sod strips on the pallet and to render it more stable. A typical loaded pallet <b>90</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, with four layers of sod strips <b>160</b> running in one direction (perpendicular to the page) and the next four layers <b>162</b> running at 90° to the first direction. To accomplish this, the sod carrier <b>94</b> is, as previously described, mounted on the gantry <b>84</b> so that the sod carrier <b>94</b> can rotate through 90°, powered by piston and cylinder <b>110</b>. For this purpose, the gantry <b>84</b> contains (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>A) a home sensor <b>166</b> and a home stop <b>170</b>, while the sod carrier <b>94</b> includes a home stop <b>174</b> and an away stop <b>176</b> and an away sensor <b>168</b>. When the sod carrier is in the non-rotated position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>A, home stop <b>174</b> on the sod carrier <b>94</b> presses against home stop <b>170</b> and home sensor <b>166</b> on the gantry. In this condition, the computer <b>144</b> is signalled to maintain low pressure in rotate cylinder <b>110</b> to hold the sod carrier <b>94</b> in the home position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, and not to rotate the sod carrier <b>94</b> to a different position.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">After a desired number of layers of sod have been deposited on the pallet <b>90</b>, then the computer will be signalled (by means to be described), after the sod carrier has picked up a load of sod strips to operate the rotate cylinder <b>110</b> to rotate the sod carrier <b>94</b> by 90° with respect to gantry <b>84</b>. When the sod carrier <b>94</b> has rotated 90°, away sensor <b>168</b> on the sod carrier <b>94</b> will press against away stop <b>176</b> on the gantry <b>84</b>. The away sensor <b>168</b> sends a signal to the computer <b>144</b> to terminate the rotation but to maintain low pressure in the rotate cylinder <b>110</b> to hold the sod carrier <b>94</b> in the 90° rotated position, so that sod strips can be deposited on the pallet <b>90</b> at 90° to the first set of sod strips. The computer <b>144</b> can be programmed to set as desired the number of layers of sod strips to be deposited on the pallet in one orientation before the next set of layers is deposited at 90° to the first set, and can also be programmed to adjust the number of sod layers deposited in one orientation before a 90° rotation occurs. After the clamps <b>130</b> are activated to release the sod, the computer reverses the operation of the rotate cylinder <b>110</b> to return the sod carrier <b>94</b> to its non-rotated condition (as it returns to its home position).</p>
    <p num="p-0140">The pallet <b>90</b> is supported on the forks <b>180</b> of a conventional forklift <b>182</b> (best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>14</b>). The forklift <b>182</b> is located in a space beside the third conveyor set <b>34</b>, which space is of sufficient size to accommodate the pallet <b>90</b>. At the beginning of a sod harvesting operation, the forks <b>180</b> are raised upwardly so that the pallet <b>90</b> is positioned only a short distance below the sod carrier <b>94</b>, so that the sod strips when released from the sod carrier will fall only a short distance and will be properly aligned on the pallet <b>90</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">As layers of sod strips are deposited on the pallet <b>90</b>, the pallet <b>90</b> will have to be lowered to make room for the increasing height of the layers stacked on the pallet. The lowering operation is controlled by an “electric eye”, consisting of a light beam projector <b>184</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) mounted at one side of the pallet <b>90</b> and projecting its light beam <b>186</b> over the upper surface of the pallet to a photocell <b>188</b> on the opposite side of the pallet. Signals from the photocell are directed to the computer <b>144</b>. A brief interruption of the light beam <b>186</b> (caused by sod dropping from the sod carrier through the light beam onto the pallet) will not trigger any lowering of the pallet, but a longer duration interruption of the light beam <b>186</b> (e.g. one second or more) will cause the photocell <b>188</b> to send a signal to the computer <b>144</b>. The computer <b>144</b> then signals the hydraulic circuit <b>145</b> to cause the forklift left cylinder <b>180</b> to lower the forks <b>180</b>. The lowering can be by a fixed amount which is approximately equal to the thickness of a sod strip, or it can be until the photocell <b>188</b> receives the light beam again from the projector <b>184</b>, at which time the lowering operation is stopped by the computer <b>144</b>. The number of lowering steps which occur after the pallet <b>90</b> is loaded onto the forks <b>80</b> is counted by the computer <b>144</b>, and when the desired number of lowering steps has occurred, then the computer sends a rotate signal so that the next predetermined number of sod layers will be loaded onto the pallet <b>90</b> with the sod strips oriented at 90° to the previous set of layers.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">It will be appreciated that for the 90° rotation feature to be effective, the sod carrier must pick-up the sod strips while in one orientation and must then rotate 90° in order to deposit the sod strips (on the pallet) at 90° to the first orientation. Therefore, the sequencing by the computer <b>144</b> is such that when the sod carrier <b>94</b> is positioned over the third conveyor set <b>34</b>, the sod carrier <b>94</b> is always in the “home” position indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8A</figref>. The gantry <b>84</b> with the sod carrier <b>94</b> suspended therefrom can then travel to the “away” position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, with the sod carrier <b>94</b> either in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> position, or rotated through 90° therefrom. The two alternative “away” positions of the sod carrier <b>94</b> can be referred to as the “unrotated away position” and the “rotated away position”. The sod carrier <b>94</b> must be fully in one of these two positions before the computer <b>144</b> will signal the hydraulic circuit <b>145</b> to open the clamps <b>130</b> and drop the sod strips onto the pallet <b>90</b>. Therefore, the signals from the proximity sensor <b>152</b> indicating that the gantry <b>84</b> has fully reached the “away” position, and from the sensors <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> indicating that the sod carrier is fully either in the unrotated away position or in the rotated away position, are required before the clamps <b>130</b> are opened to release the sod strips.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">It will be appreciated that the gantry <b>84</b> must travel back and forth rapidly, and that the sod carrier must rotate rapidly, to complete their required movements in the relatively short time period available between the arrivals of successive sets of sod strips. The resultant rapid accelerations and decelerations can heavily shake the sod harvester <b>10</b>. To reduce this tendency, the sod harvester <b>10</b> is supported at its rear end, beneath the third set of conveyors <b>34</b>, by a heavy roller <b>192</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The roller <b>192</b> serves to dampen and reduce the amplitude of vibrations occurring when the gantry and sod carrier are accelerating and decelerating. The roller <b>192</b> also helps to support the load of the harvester, particularly when it is carrying a pallet loaded with sod and a stack of empty pallets, and also serves better to balance the machine. A piston and cylinder <b>194</b> can be provided to adjust the weight division between the roller <b>192</b> and the rear wheels <b>196</b> of the harvester, and also to raise the roller <b>192</b> off the ground when the cutting knives are raised from the ground, so that the harvester <b>10</b> can travel.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">In place of roller <b>192</b>, a set of wheels of a suitable hardness may be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">When the pallet <b>90</b> is full of sod and is ready to be discharged, it is preferred that it be placed on the ground in a position in which it will be out of the path of the return movement of the sod harvester during a harvesting operation. Therefore, the forklift mast <b>200</b> is preferably mounted on a rod <b>202</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>14</b>) and can be side shifted using a side shift piston and cylinder <b>204</b>, as is well-known in the industry, so that before the pallet <b>90</b> is lowered onto the ground, it is side shifted as far as possible to one side of the harvester.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">The foregoing description has discussed harvesting three side-by-side strips so that a complete layer for the pallet can be picked up and deposited on the pallet, thus eliminating the need for separate movements to build up a layer on the pallet from separate pieces. Transferring an entire layer onto the pallet is more efficient than transferring only part of a layer, although if desired, the features of the invention can be used to transfer part of a layer in one operation and then to transfer further parts of the layer in additional operations.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">If the harvester <b>10</b> is used to harvest only a single wide slab or strip of sod and then send that strip up conveyors to be picked up and placed on a pallet, then variations can be made in the apparatus described. For example, while three sequential sets of conveyors are still desirable, with each travelling faster than the preceding set to produce a gap or time interval between the times when successive pieces of sod arrive at the buffer conveyor (i.e. at the third conveyor), it may be less necessary to have the third conveyor travelling faster than the second conveyor, since the gap produced by the differences in speed between the first and second conveyors may be sufficient for sod pick-up and deposit operations. In any event, while a one/two/three speed ratio is preferred for the three conveyor sets (i.e. ground speed for the first set, double ground speed for the second set, and three times ground speed for the third set), these speeds can be varied depending on the need, so long as a sufficient time interval is produced between the arrivals of successive sets of sod pieces to allow the set on the buffer conveyor or conveyors to be picked up. Also, additional conveyor sets can be included in the sequence, either for further movement of the sod, or to increase the size and duration of the gap between sod strips arriving at the buffer conveyor, or both.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, which show diagrammatic views of a sod harvester according to the invention mounted on the side of a tractor, rather than being pulled by a tractor. Prime reference numerals are used to indicate parts corresponding to those of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 16</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">The sod harvester <b>10</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, <b>18</b> is essentially the same as that shown in the preceding Figs., with respect to the components used to harvest sod, move it upwardly and rearwardly along three sets of conveyors <b>30</b>′, <b>32</b>′, <b>34</b>′, and then pick up the sod slabs using the sod pick-up and transfer mechanism <b>80</b>′. However, the harvester <b>10</b>′ is now mounted on the side of a tractor <b>210</b>, employing a conventional mounting mechanism (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0150">The feature of particular interest in the harvester <b>10</b>′ is the use of “bogie” wheels <b>214</b> which help to support the harvester. If the harvester is designed to cut a wide set of sod slabs, then the harvester will be heavy and needs the bogie wheels for support. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, <b>18</b>, the bogie wheels <b>214</b> are mounted on an axle <b>216</b> which has its axis aligned (in a front to rear direction) with the axis of axle <b>218</b> of the tractor rear wheels <b>220</b>. (As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, since bogie wheels <b>214</b> are of smaller diameter than the tractor rear wheels <b>220</b>, the bogie axle <b>216</b> is not aligned in a vertical direction with axis <b>218</b> of the tractor rear wheels, i.e. axle <b>216</b> is below axle <b>218</b>.)</p>
    <p num="p-0151">The bogie wheels <b>214</b> are not fixed immovably to the harvester <b>10</b>′, but rather are mounted on a suspension comprising a beam <b>222</b> extending in a front to rear direction and supporting the axle <b>216</b>. The front end of beam <b>222</b> is mounted at pivot <b>224</b> on a cross beam <b>226</b> of the harvester <b>10</b>′, so that the harvester bogie wheels <b>214</b> can move upwardly and downwardly in the direction of arrow <b>228</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">The rear end of beam <b>222</b> is pivotably connected at <b>230</b> to a piston and cylinder <b>232</b>, the upper end of which is connected at pivot <b>234</b> to another cross beam <b>236</b> of the harvester <b>10</b>′.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">With the arrangement shown, a desired amount of pressure can be applied to the bogie wheels <b>214</b>, using piston and cylinder <b>232</b>, to support a portion of the weight of the harvester. Appropriate damping means (similar to a shock absorber) can if desired be incorporated into piston and cylinder <b>222</b>, to absorb shocks and provide some resiliency as the harvester <b>10</b>′ travels over undulating ground. In fact, piston and cylinder <b>222</b> can be a shock absorber, pressurized with air. In addition, other suspension arrangements can be used, e.g. a piston and spring combination.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">Similar to the previous embodiment, the axle of the rear roller <b>192</b>′ is supported by a beam <b>240</b> pivotably mounted at <b>242</b> to a fixed member <b>244</b> of the harvester. A piston and cylinder <b>246</b> pivotably connected between an extension <b>248</b> of the beam <b>240</b> and a fixed member <b>250</b> of the harvester allows a desired amount of pressure to be transferred to the rear roller <b>192</b>′. In addition, as before, when the cutting knives of the harvester <b>10</b>′ are raised out of the ground, the rear roller <b>192</b>′ will normally also be automatically raised above the ground by piston and cylinder <b>246</b>, to allow for travel of the harvester <b>10</b>′. During such travel, the weight of the harvester <b>10</b>′ will be supported by the tractor <b>210</b> and by the bogie wheels <b>214</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">While the cutting knives <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>′, <b>12</b>-<b>2</b>′, <b>12</b>-<b>3</b>′ have been shown in fixed relation, they can if desired be made adjustable. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the right hand cutting knife <b>12</b>-<b>3</b>′ can be fixed to the harvester, but the two left hand cutting knives <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>′ can be made adjustable in a side-to-side direction, e.g. by mounting them on a beam <b>252</b> with a number of sets of mounting holes, so that the knives <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>′, <b>12</b>-<b>2</b>′ can be bolted to beam <b>252</b> using one of several available sets of mounting holes for each knife. In this way, the size of the narrow sod strip to be left in the field for regrowth after sod slabs have been cut and removed, can be varied depending on the sod grower's preference. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the sod cutting knives <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>′ to <b>12</b>-<b>3</b>′ have been shown as aligned in a front to rear direction, which assumes a moderate spacing between the sides of the sod slabs being cut. If a zero spacing is desired (as previously described), then the center knife <b>12</b>-<b>2</b>′ can be offset forwardly or rearwardly, as previously discussed.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref>, which show a different way of stacking sod on a pallet from that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, but which also serves to tie the stacked sod on the pallet together. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref>, a first layer <b>300</b> consisting of three sod strips is deposited on the pallet <b>90</b>. A second layer <b>302</b> also consisting of three sod strips is then deposited on top of the first layer <b>300</b>, but layer <b>302</b> is offset sideways by a small amount (e.g. one inch to two and a half inches, or more if desired) with respect to layer <b>300</b>. Then the next layer <b>304</b> is deposited on top of layer <b>302</b>, but with the side edges <b>304</b> <i>a </i>of layer <b>304</b> aligned with the side edges <b>300</b> <i>a </i>of the first layer <b>300</b> and therefore overlapping the side edges <b>302</b> <i>a </i>of layer <b>302</b>. The overlap is indicated at <b>305</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. As successive layers are stacked, each layer overlaps the side edges of the sod strips on the layer beneath it. The weight of the sod pressing on the overlapped portions ties the slabs of sod together when stacked on a pallet and makes unnecessary the need for rotating sets of layers through 90°, as described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. This eliminates the need for the rotating mechanism of the sod carrier <b>94</b>, thus substantially simplifying the apparatus.</p>
    <p num="p-0157">To practice the method described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref>, the proximity switch <b>152</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) which controls the position at which the sod carrier <b>94</b> ends its sideways travel and drops a layer of sod onto the pallet <b>90</b>, can be modified to sense the two overlapped positions required, or alternatively (and preferably) the computer <b>144</b> may be programmed simply to allow (for example) one inch or more of additional movement of the sod carrier <b>94</b> on each alternating trip of the sod carrier <b>94</b> over the pallet <b>90</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">Another way to practice the method described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref> is to use the feature that the forklift <b>182</b> has a side shift piston and cylinder <b>204</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). The side shift piston and cylinder <b>204</b> may be controlled by the computer <b>144</b> to shift the pallet <b>90</b> sideways by the required distance (e.g. one to two and a half inches, or more) just before the sod carrier <b>94</b> drops a layer of sod on the pallet <b>90</b>, so that alternating layers are overlapped as described.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">In addition, instead of offsetting alternating layers (in which case each layer is offset with respect to the layer beneath it), such offsetting can be done every third layer, or every fourth layer, or as desired, so long as the stack of layers are adequately tied together on the pallet <b>90</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 to 24</figref>, which show the situation when each sod strip <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>3</b> is cut into two pieces by a cross cut knife such as knife <b>146</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. In the example illustrated, this results in six sod pieces <b>14</b>-<b>10</b> to <b>14</b>-<b>15</b> inclusive. Each piece has a pair of longitudinal edges, indicated at <b>350</b>, and a pair of lateral or widthwise edges, indicated at <b>352</b>. When these layers are stacked on a pallet, overlap can be provided both widthwise (as also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref>) and lengthwise (in which case at least some of the widthwise edges <b>352</b> are overlaid by the sod above them).</p>
    <p num="p-0161">The overlapping of the longitudinal edges <b>350</b> can be accomplished, as described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref>, by programming the computer <b>144</b> to cause the sod carrier <b>94</b> to travel to different positions over the pallet <b>90</b> as alternate layers of sod are deposited. Thus, using the signal from proximity switch <b>152</b>, and under control of computer <b>144</b>, the sod carrier <b>94</b> alternatingly deposits the sod on the pallet <b>90</b> in two positions, one overlapping the other by between one and two and a half inches (all dimensions are exemplary) to provide the widthwise overlap indicated at <b>354</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0162">The lengthwise overlap of the widthwise edges <b>352</b>, such overlap being indicated at <b>356</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, may be provided in various ways. One method, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 to 29</figref>, is to mount the forks <b>180</b> on the forklift mast <b>360</b> by a scissors mechanism diagrammatically indicated at <b>362</b>. The scissors mechanism <b>362</b> may be operated in conventional manner by a piston and cylinder (not shown) to move the forks <b>180</b> in a lengthwise direction, towards and away from the mast <b>360</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 to 28</figref>. This movement will shift the sod pieces in a lengthwise direction, producing the lengthwise offset or overlap indicated at <b>356</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. Again, operation of the scissors mechanism <b>362</b> is controlled by computer <b>144</b>, so that the correct movement occurs at the correct time. The amount by which the scissors are extended can be controlled by a microswitch or a proximity sensor, not shown.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">As described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref>, the lengthwise overlap <b>356</b>, as well as the widthwise overlap, can be of every alternate layer, or every second, third or fourth layer, or as desired so long as the stacks of sod pieces are tied together sufficiently to result in a stable pile of sod on the pallet <b>90</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0164"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref> show the scissors <b>362</b> retracted and the forks side shifted right, while <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> show the scissors <b>362</b> extended and the forks side shifted left.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">In some cases, the harvester may cut a single wide sod strip <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, and such wide sod strip may then be cut into desired pieces <b>400</b>-<b>14</b> by knives <b>146</b>A (similar to knife <b>146</b>) located in the bottom of the sod carrier <b>94</b>. As before, the cutting occurs when the conveyor bed frame <b>140</b> carrying the sod strip <b>14</b> is pressed against the bottom of the sod carrier <b>94</b> (or when the sod carrier <b>94</b> is pressed against the third set conveyors <b>34</b> on the bed frame <b>140</b>). The sod piece <b>14</b> can in this manner be cut into any desired number of pieces, e.g. two pieces, three pieces, four or six pieces. Stacking of these pieces may be performed as described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 24</figref>, with each layer offset in a widthwise (lateral direction) as described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref>, and if the sod slab is cut crosswise into several pieces in a lengthwise direction, then the overlap will also be as described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 to 24</figref>, i.e. in a front to rear (lengthwise) direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 to 37A</figref>, B, C which show diagrammatically an automatic pallet injector <b>400</b> according to the invention, to enable the harvester to cut sod continuously without having to stop to eject a completed sod stack and load a new pallet. It will be appreciated that if the harvester has to stop each time a loaded pallet is to be discharged, then use of the harvester will be much less efficient than if continuous operation were possible.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A</figref>, B, C, the pallet injector <b>400</b> includes a pallet support structure <b>402</b> comprising a set of support rails <b>404</b>. The rails <b>404</b> are spaced laterally apart to carry a stack <b>406</b> of pallets. The stack <b>406</b> of pallets is normally confined in a hopper shown in dotted lines at <b>408</b>. The rails <b>404</b> and the bottom pallet <b>410</b> in the stack are located beneath and clear of the bottom of the hopper <b>408</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">The rails <b>404</b> support an injector sheet <b>412</b> which in turn supports the bottom pallet of the stack <b>406</b> and is movable on wheels <b>414</b> rolling on rails <b>404</b> between an extended position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A</figref>, B, C and a retracted position shown for example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A</figref>, B, C. In the retracted position, the injector sheet <b>412</b> is located over the rails <b>404</b> and does not protrude beyond the front edge <b>413</b> of the hopper <b>408</b>. Any desired mechanism, e.g. pistons and cylinders (not shown) can be used to move the injector sheet <b>412</b> between its extended and retracted positions. Injector sheet <b>412</b> can also move on slides or in any other known way. Proximity sensors or microswitches (not shown) control the extent of the extension and retraction of the injector sheet <b>412</b>, by sending position signals in conventional manner to computer <b>144</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 to 34A</figref>, B, C, the forks <b>180</b> are in a lowered position (it is assumed that they have just discharged a pallet loaded with sod). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A</figref>, B, C, the injector sheet <b>412</b> is in its retracted position, and in FIGS. <b>33</b>A, B, C, the injector sheet <b>412</b> is shown in its extended position, supporting a pallet <b>410</b> over the forks <b>180</b>. The injector sheet <b>412</b> may typically include small barbs or the like, e.g. crosswise bars or tubes (not shown) to grip the bottom of the bottom pallet <b>410</b> and move it forwardly, out from under the remaining pallets in the stack <b>406</b>. Movement of the remaining pallets in stack <b>406</b> is prevented by the walls of the hopper <b>408</b> in which they are located.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">After the bottom pallet <b>410</b> has been dispensed from the stack <b>406</b> of pallets and is located over the forks <b>180</b>, the pallet <b>410</b> is temporarily supported by the injector sheet <b>412</b> while stacking of sod pieces on pallet <b>410</b> begins. It is necessary for injector sheet <b>412</b> to temporarily support the pallet <b>410</b> at this time, since the forks <b>180</b> will have just finished supporting a previously fully loaded pallet of sod and are not yet available to hold a new pallet. Since the harvester is continuing to harvest sod and needs to stack the newly harvested sod without interruption, therefore the required temporary support of pallet <b>410</b> is provided by the injector sheet <b>412</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0171"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A</figref>, B, C show the pallet <b>410</b> supported temporarily by the injector sheet <b>412</b> and with the first two, three or four (or more) layers of sod <b>420</b> stacked on the pallet <b>410</b>. The forks <b>180</b> are still shown in their lowered position.</p>
    <p num="p-0172"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A</figref>, B, C show the forks <b>180</b> in raised position in which they have now taken over the job of supporting the pallet <b>410</b>, with several layers of sod <b>420</b> thereon. As will be evident from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 to 33A</figref>, the injector sheet <b>412</b> contains laterally spaced apart slots <b>421</b> through which the forks <b>180</b> can pass, so the forks can take over supporting the pallet from the injector sheet <b>412</b>. Although injector <b>412</b> has been shown as a sheet, separate tubes or rods can be used if desired to form the injector and to provide sufficient temporary support for the partly loaded pallet <b>410</b>. When the forks <b>180</b> take over the job of supporting the pallet <b>410</b>, they raise the pallet above the position in which it was formally supported by the injector sheet <b>412</b>, by about two inches. The precise amount by which the forks lift the pallet above the injector sheet can be varied, but should be enough to ensure that the pallet is above the injector sheet <b>412</b> and does not obstruct withdrawal of the injector sheet <b>412</b> to its retracted position.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">Once the forks <b>180</b> have taken over the task of supporting the loaded pallet <b>410</b>, the injector sheet <b>412</b> may be withdrawn to its retracted position (shown for example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32</figref>, <b>36</b>A, B, C). The harvester <b>10</b> then continues to stack sod on the pallet <b>410</b> until the pallet is fully loaded, as previously described, at which time the electric eye <b>184</b>, <b>188</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) causes the computer <b>144</b> to control the forks <b>180</b> to lower the fully loaded pallet <b>410</b> to the ground for discharge (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A</figref>, B, C). When the pallet <b>410</b> is lowered to the ground, then since it is facing rearwardly, it will be discharged as the harvester moves forwardly away from it. Downward movement of the forks <b>180</b> at this time is terminated by a proximity sensor <b>421</b> at the bottom of the fork mast. Sensor <b>421</b> signals the computer <b>144</b> to end lowering of the forks at this time. After the loaded pallet has been discharged from the forks <b>180</b> (the computer provides a short time interval for this after proximity sensor <b>421</b> has been activated to stop the lowering of the forks), then the computer <b>144</b> causes the forks to be raised again, to support a new pallet which has been injected.</p>
    <p num="p-0174">A second electric eye sensor, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35C</figref> as having a light beam projector <b>422</b> and a photocell <b>424</b>, is located below the electric eye <b>184</b>, <b>188</b>. Electric eye <b>422</b>, <b>424</b> senses when the top of the finished sod stack passes photocell sensor <b>424</b> on the travel of the finished sod stack down to the ground. The signal from the second electric eye <b>422</b>, <b>424</b> is transmitted to the computer <b>144</b> to inform the computer that the top of the loaded pallet being lowered is now below the level of the injector sheet <b>412</b>. The computer then actuates the injector sheet <b>412</b> to remove a new pallet from the bottom of the stack <b>406</b> and to move it forward into the sod stacking position shown for example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref>, B, C. As described, the injector sheet <b>412</b> remains in its extended position and supports the new pallet <b>410</b> for stacking of the first two or more layers of sod, to allow time for the previous sod laden pallet to be ejected and for the forks <b>180</b> to rise back up to support the new pallet <b>410</b>. The upward travel of the forks <b>180</b> at this time may be controlled and stopped by a proximity sensor, diagrammatically indicated at <b>426</b>, on the mast <b>360</b>. As mentioned, the forks are stopped after they have raised the new pallet <b>410</b> clear of the injector sheet, to allow the injector sheet to be withdrawn. A sequence detector function in the computer <b>144</b> detects that the upward movement of the forks has terminated, and then signals the injector sheet <b>412</b> to return to its retracted position shown, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A</figref>, B, C.</p>
    <p num="p-0175">The proximity sensor or microswitch (not shown) which terminates the movement of the pallet injector sheet <b>412</b> back to its retracted position, also signals or enables the start of the first set <b>184</b>, <b>186</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) of electric eyes' function to lower the forks <b>180</b> during stack building as required. (It will be understood that the forks <b>180</b>, when they are supporting a loaded pallet, should not be lowered until after the injector sheet <b>412</b> has been fully retracted, so that the pallet does not interfere with the injector sheet retraction.)</p>
    <p num="p-0176">While the lowering of the fully loaded pallet during stack building has been described as initiated by the first electric eye set <b>184</b>, <b>185</b>, such lowering can be accomplished in other ways. For example, the computer <b>144</b> can count the layers deposited on the pallet by the sod carrier, and after the count has reached (for example) 30 to 35 layers, then lowering of the loaded pallet can be initiated.</p>
    <p num="p-0177">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38</figref>, <b>39</b> which show an alternative and relatively low cost way of obtaining overlap between slabs of sod stacked in successive layers on a pallet. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38</figref>, <b>39</b>, each layer <b>500</b>, <b>502</b> (only two layers are shown) may be rotated slightly, typically between 5° and 10°, with respect to the layer below it. For example, the second layer <b>502</b> may be rotated 5° to 10° counterclockwise (as shown) with respect to the first layer <b>500</b>. The third layer (not shown) may be aligned with the first layer <b>500</b>. The fourth layer (not shown) may be aligned with the second layer <b>502</b>. A 5° rotation of a sod layer that is 48″ by 48″ will produce approximately a two inch overlap, or overhang, as indicated at <b>504</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0178">With the method of stacking shown, sufficient overlap is achieved to tie the stack together so that it is more resistant to damage when travelling. Since the amount of rotation used is small, the limited rotation needed can be achieved quickly (in much less time than that needed for a 90° rotation). In addition, since only limited rotation is used, the loaded pallet is not appreciably larger in plan view from a pallet where no overlap between successive sod layers is provided.</p>
    <p num="p-0179">The rotation needed for the overlap in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38</figref>, <b>39</b> can be achieved by any appropriate mechanism. For example, the rotate cylinder mechanism <b>110</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0180">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40</figref>, <b>41</b>, which show another way of achieving overlap between successive layers of sod slabs. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, a pair of vertical piling walls <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> are provided. The walls <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> define a piling cavity <b>514</b> which accommodates a pallet <b>520</b> with very close tolerances, thus forming a “tight” piling cavity. The pallet <b>520</b> is located in cavity <b>514</b> and is initially above the bottom edges <b>516</b> of the piling walls <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0181">In operation, a first layer <b>520</b> (formed by three sod slabs) is deposited into the cavity <b>514</b> in a position displaced toward one of the piling walls <b>510</b>, so that one edge <b>522</b> of the first sod layer is curled upwardly.</p>
    <p num="p-0182">A second sod layer <b>524</b> is then deposited into the piling cavity <b>514</b> in a position such that the edge <b>526</b> of the second sod layer opposite to the edge <b>522</b> of the first sod layer is displaced toward the piling wall <b>512</b>, causing the edge <b>526</b> of the second sod layer to curl upwardly. This process is continued with alternate sod layers, resulting in the stack shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40</figref>, <b>41</b>, in which sod layers slightly overlap the sod layers beneath them. To achieve this result, each sod layer must be moved to a sideways offset position with respect to the sod layer below it. This can be accomplished, for example, by any of the mechanisms previously described. Since the sod is not resilient, but rather is somewhat moldable, it is found, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, that the upturned edges of the sod layers remain upturned when the pallet is removed from the cavity <b>514</b>, thus helping to tie the sod stack together. An advantage of this system is, for example, that 54 inch side sod slabs can be cut (instead of the usual 48 inch slab), and yet because of these upturned edges on the pallet, they will only occupy a width of (for example) 50 inches, thus enabling storage of more sod on a pallet of given width.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</figref>, <b>42</b>B to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A</figref>, <b>47</b>B, all of which show various forms of pallet which cause a concave (as viewed from above) stack of sod slabs to be formed. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</figref>, <b>42</b>B, a pallet <b>540</b> is shown having a shallow V-shaped upper surface <b>542</b> (as viewed from one end of the pallet). The V-shaped upper surface <b>542</b> results from forming the pallet to be thicker at its side edges <b>544</b> than at its center <b>546</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">When sod is stacked on the pallet <b>540</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, the stack <b>550</b> of sod layers will have a concave upper surface <b>552</b>, i.e. its outer edge portions will extend upwardly as well as outwardly. This acts in a manner similar to overlapping the sod slabs and thus strengthens the sod stack against falling apart during travel. Since this method does not require any side shifting or rotation of the sod slabs, the machine for stacking the sod can be simplified, although there is a cost for the special pallets.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">The pallet <b>540</b>-<b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A</figref>, <b>43</b>B is similar to pallet <b>540</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</figref>, <b>42</b>B except that the upper surface <b>542</b>-<b>2</b> of the pallet <b>540</b>-<b>2</b> is concavely curved, rather than being V-shaped.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">The pallet <b>540</b>-<b>3</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44A</figref>, <b>44</b>B is simplified in that it has a flat upper surface with upwardly protruding edges <b>552</b> (which if the pallet is made of wood can be formed simply by adding an extra piece of wood or rail <b>554</b> to each side of the pallet). Provided that the pallet is no wider than the layer of sod to be deposited on it, the upwardly protruding edges <b>552</b> will cause a sod stack deposited on the pallet to have a concave upper surface, with upwardly and outwardly protruding edges, as described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0187">If desired, and as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A</figref>, <b>45</b>B, the upwardly protruding rails <b>554</b> which have been added to the side edges of the pallet can be located on all four sides of the pallet <b>540</b>-<b>4</b>, thus making the sod stack piled on this pallet even more resistant to vibration.</p>
    <p num="p-0188"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A</figref>, <b>46</b>B show a pallet <b>540</b>-<b>5</b> having a concave upper surface formed from three flat sections <b>560</b>, <b>562</b>, <b>564</b>. The outer sections <b>560</b>, <b>564</b> provide openings <b>566</b> at each lower side of the pallet for a forklift.</p>
    <p num="p-0189">Alternatively, the pallet <b>540</b>-<b>6</b> can as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A</figref>, <b>47</b>B have a V-shaped upper surface with side edges dimensioned such that the bottom center of the “V” <b>570</b> as well as the bottoms of the side edges <b>544</b>-<b>6</b> all rest on the ground, providing three lines of support for the pallet <b>540</b>-<b>6</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0190">In some cases, it may be desirable to cut an elongated slab of sod, as shown at <b>580</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, and then to cut slab <b>580</b> partially into two sections <b>580</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>580</b>-<b>2</b> which are connected by small pieces of earth and root <b>582</b>. The two pieces or sections <b>580</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>580</b>-<b>2</b> can readily be pulled apart when the sod is to be laid, but prior to being pulled apart, the connecting portions <b>582</b> perform a function similar to overlapping, in that they tie the two pieces <b>580</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>580</b>-<b>2</b> together and thus help stabilize the sod stack against falling apart during activities such as transporting the sod stack.</p>
    <p num="p-0191">To perform its function of leaving the two parts of the sod slab <b>580</b> connected, the cross-cut knife <b>584</b> (which can be the knife that normally cross-cuts the sod while the sod is still in the ground or positioned as knife <b>146</b> to cut sod resting on the third conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>34</b>-<b>3</b>) is provided with two notches <b>586</b>, each extending from a cutting edge comprising a portion of the lower edge <b>588</b> of the cutting knife <b>584</b> upwardly and having a height approximately equal to the thickness of the sod slab. The height can be slightly less than the thickness of the sod slab (which would weaken the connection) or it can be equal to or greater than the height of the sod slab, which would leave a connection of thickness equal to the full thickness of the sod slab <b>580</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0192">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50A</figref>, <b>50</b>B, <b>50</b>C, which show variations of the notches in the cross-cut knife <b>584</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50A</figref>, a single V-shaped central notch <b>590</b> is provided in the bottom of the cross-cut knife <b>584</b>, so that the two sections of the sod slab <b>580</b> will be connected by a single connecting portion, which can be of desired width to achieve a suitable compromise between having the two sod sections <b>580</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>580</b>-<b>2</b> connected together strongly enough to resist falling apart of the sod stack, and being able to pull the two sections <b>580</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>580</b>-<b>2</b> of the sod slab apart for sod laying purposes.</p>
    <p num="p-0193">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50B</figref>, a single rectangular notch <b>592</b> is provided at the center of the lower edge of the cross-cut knife <b>584</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0194">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50C</figref>, the two bottom outer corners of the cross-cut knife <b>584</b> are each bevelled or sloped, as indicated at <b>594</b>, to form recesses so that a connecting portion of sod slab will occur at each side of the sod slab <b>580</b>. (It is assumed that the width of the sod slab, which is set by the standard side cutting knives used in sod harvesters, is equal to the width of the cut-off knife <b>584</b> and greater than the width of the cutting edge of the cut-off knife.)</p>
    <p num="p-0195"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50D</figref> shows a cut-off knife <b>584</b> similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50C</figref>, but with a rectangular notch <b>596</b> or recess at each bottom corner of the knife <b>584</b>, thus also leaving a connecting portion at each side of the sod slab <b>580</b>, connecting the two sections of the sod slab.</p>
    <p num="p-0196"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50E</figref> shows a combination of a cross-cut knife <b>584</b>, and two conventional side cutting knives <b>600</b>, with the side cutting knives <b>600</b> spaced slightly outwardly laterally of the side edges of the cross-cut knife <b>584</b>. In other words, the cross-cut knife <b>584</b> does not span the full width of the sod slab being cut, and thus also leaves small connecting portions <b>582</b> between adjacent sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0197">It may be desired to leave the small connecting portion or portions <b>582</b> between some sod slab sections, but not others. For example, sod slab <b>580</b> may be cut into two connected portions <b>580</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>580</b>-<b>2</b> as described, but it may be desired to cut or sever the next slab (not shown) completely free of slab <b>580</b>. This can be accomplished by providing additional cut-off knife sections shown in dotted lines at <b>602</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50E</figref>. Knife sections <b>602</b> are normally positioned out of the gaps <b>582</b> or recesses but can be moved into gaps <b>582</b> by any desired means, to produce a full cut completely across the width of the sod slab <b>580</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0198">It will be realized that sod harvesting and stacking machines of the kind described may be used to harvest sod from many different fields of sod. In some cases, it may be important not to contaminate a field containing one variety of sod with seeds and roots from a different variety of sod which was growing in a field on which the harvester was previously working. The danger of such cross-contamination between two fields of sod can be reduced by providing the harvester with an air compressor, shown for example in dotted lines at <b>610</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The air compressor <b>610</b> is connected to one or more air hoses <b>612</b> (also shown in dotted lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and each equipped with a conventional trigger operated blowing nozzle <b>614</b>. The air compressor <b>610</b> can be separately powered by its own gasoline engine, or it can be operated by a hydraulic motor on the harvester <b>10</b>, or it can be operated from the powered take-off of the towing vehicle. In use, when the harvester is moving to a new field containing a different variety of sod than was previously harvested, the air compressor <b>610</b> is started and the nozzles <b>614</b> are used to clean with compressed air the parts of the harvester <b>10</b> which are most likely to carry seeds or root portions, e.g. the undercutting, side cutting and cross-cutting knives, the roller, and the sod conveyors and sod transport mechanisms.</p>
    <p num="p-0199">As previously discussed in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref>, <b>18</b>, the harvester may have a plurality of sod cutting heads, e.g. three such heads to cut three side-by-side strips of sod. Depending on the nature of the sod, it may be desirable to leave uncut strips of sod in the field between the cut strips which have been removed. The uncut strips may need to be of various widths, depending on the nature of the sod, the soil and the growing conditions. In some cases, it may be desired not to leave any uncut strip between the cut strips, but rather to clear cut the field and then to regrow a new crop of sod by reseeding the field. To facilitate adjustment of the sod cutting heads for this purpose, for example, where three sod cutting heads <b>650</b>, <b>652</b>, <b>654</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>) are used, two of the sod cutting heads <b>650</b>, <b>652</b>, <b>654</b> may be mounted for transverse sliding movement on a mounting frame <b>656</b> at the front of the harvester <b>10</b>″. Where the harvester <b>10</b>″ is mounted on the side of a tractor <b>210</b>, the two movable heads can be the two outermost heads (away from the tractor), i.e. heads <b>650</b>, <b>652</b>. Each head <b>650</b>, <b>652</b>, <b>654</b> will preferably include a complete conventional sod strip cutting mechanism, including cross-cut knife, undercutting knife with side cutting blades, a hydraulic motor and mechanism to power the knives, a depth adjustment linkage, and a sod roller (all of these parts are conventional). The heads <b>650</b>, <b>652</b> are both mounted for lateral sliding movement on a transverse frame <b>660</b> and can be moved laterally back and forth by pistons and cylinders diagrammatically indicated at <b>662</b>, <b>664</b>. In this manner, the lateral distance between the sod cutting heads <b>650</b>, <b>652</b>, <b>654</b> can be easily adjusted to set the width of the uncut strips between the cut sod strips. If desired, additional clamp locks (not shown) can be provided to clamp the cutting heads to the transverse frame <b>660</b> at their set positions, in case of hydraulic fluid leakage from the pistons and cylinders <b>662</b>, <b>664</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0200">Finally, reference is made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52</figref>, <b>53</b>, which show a modified cross-cut blade arrangement which is suitable for use when a very wide sod slab is to be cut from the ground. When a wide sod slab is to be cut, a set of several undercutting knives may be used, one positioned beside the other, and with only the outer sod undercutting knives having side cutting blades to cut the edges of the slab. With such an arrangement, if the ground being cut is uneven, the side-by-side sod undercutting knives can adjust to the unevenness (since each is supported by a roller of relatively short lateral width). However, if a single cross-cut knife is used, and if the ground is uneven (for example, if there is a shallow V-shaped gully in the ground being cut), then the cross-cut knife will not cross-cut the full width of the sod slab uniformly and may not penetrate deeply enough into the ground at certain points. If this occurs, then the sod slabs being cut may not be sufficiently separated from each other, and this can cause serious problems during rolling or stacking.</p>
    <p num="p-0201">In the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52</figref>, <b>53</b>, three cross-cut knives <b>700</b>, <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> are mounted side-by-side on a cross-cut frame <b>706</b>. Each knife <b>700</b>, <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> is pivotably mounted by a pivot <b>710</b>, <b>712</b>, <b>714</b> on a plate <b>720</b>, <b>722</b>, <b>724</b>. The plates <b>720</b>, <b>722</b>, <b>724</b> are supported by further pivots <b>730</b>, <b>732</b>, <b>734</b> on the cross-cut frame <b>706</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0202">The pivots <b>710</b>, <b>712</b>, <b>714</b> have axes which are generally horizontal and which are generally aligned with the path of travel of the harvester, so that the cross-cut knives can align themselves with the contours of the ground being cut. The pivots <b>730</b>, <b>732</b>, <b>734</b> have axes which are generally horizontal and generally transverse to the path of harvester travel, so that (as is conventional), after the cross-cut knives penetrated the ground, these knives can tilt rearwardly (as the harvester travels forwardly) until they are lifted out of the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0203">A conventional mechanism is used to operate the cross-cut knives shown. In a conventional cross-cut mechanism, the cross-cut blade is raised against the pressure of a heavy spring by a cam; then the cam suddenly removes lifting support, allowing the spring or springs to drive the cross-cut blade into the ground. A similar arrangement is used in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52</figref>, <b>53</b>. As shown, the cross-cut frame <b>706</b> is mounted to the main frame <b>750</b> of the harvester, with guides (not shown) constraining the cross-cut frame <b>706</b> to move vertically up and down on the harvester frame <b>750</b>. As is usual for cross-cut mechanisms, leaf springs (not shown) are provided to strongly bias the cross-cut frame <b>706</b> downwardly. The cross-cut frame <b>706</b> is, however, supported by two laterally spaced cam followers <b>754</b>, <b>756</b> which ride on the peripheries of a pair of cams <b>760</b>, <b>762</b> mounted on a shaft <b>764</b> which is supported at its ends on the main frame <b>750</b> of the harvester. As is usual, the cams <b>760</b>, <b>762</b> rotate at ground speed, periodically raising the cross-cut frame <b>706</b> and then suddenly removing lifting support from it (at the rearwardly inwardly extending sections <b>770</b>, <b>772</b> of the cam profiles), thus periodically allowing the cross-cut frame to drive the cross-cut knives <b>710</b>, <b>712</b>, <b>714</b> into the ground to cross-cut the sod.</p>
    <p num="p-0204">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54 and 55</figref>, which show another aspect of the invention. As there shown, there are two third set conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>. Each third set conveyor is divided into (for example) three subconveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a</i>, <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> <i>b</i>, <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> <i>a</i>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> <i>b</i>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> <i>c</i>. The subconveyors of each third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> are linked together by chain and sprocket mechanisms (not shown) similar to chain and sprocket mechanism <b>46</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so that only one of the three subconveyors of each third set conveyor need be driven to drive all three subconveyors of a third set conveyor.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">The division of each third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> into three subconveyors provides two gaps or depressions <b>800</b>, <b>802</b> in the top of each of these conveyors, to accommodate cross-cut knives as will be explained.</p>
    <p num="p-0206">To bridge the gaps between the subconveyors of each third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, pairs of wedge-shaped members <b>804</b> are mounted one between each adjacent pair of third set subconveyors (and are supported on the conveyor frame by means not shown). Each wedged-shaped member <b>804</b> has a slot <b>806</b> therein to accommodate the blade of a cross-cut knife (to be described).</p>
    <p num="p-0207">The sod carrier <b>808</b> (which may be essentially the same as sod carrier <b>94</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and following) supports two cross-cut knives <b>810</b>, <b>812</b>, which are suspended over the slots <b>806</b> in the third set conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>. Thus, when the sod carrier <b>808</b> is lowered onto sod (not shown) on the third set conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, the cross-cut knives <b>810</b>, <b>812</b> penetrate the sod and cut it into shorter lengths. The slots <b>806</b> allow the cross-cut knives <b>810</b>, <b>812</b> to penetrate fully through and slightly beyond the full thickness of the sod on the third set conveyors during the cross-cut operation. As previously described, either the sod carrier <b>808</b> can be lowered onto the sod on third set conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, or the third set conveyors can be raised and pushed against the sod carrier <b>808</b>, or a combination of these two operations may occur. At this time, as previously described, the third set conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> are stationary (this is possible because of the wide gap between successive strips of sod; see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>c</i>), thus allowing the sod strips on them to be cross-cut and picked up from the third set conveyors before the next set of sod strips arrives.</p>
    <p num="p-0208">By way of example, the sod strip on each third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> can be 48 inches long by 24 inches wide. When the 48 inch length is cut into three equal length pieces, each piece will be 16 inches long. Thus, after cross-cutting, each third set conveyor will carry three sod slabs, each sod slab being 16 inches by 24 inches, for a total sod dimension of 48 inches by 48 inches (divided into six easy to handle sod slabs). The entire set of six sod slabs can be picked up and deposited on a standard 48 inch by 48 inch pallet, using the sod carrier <b>808</b> in the same manner as sod carrier <b>94</b>, as described previously in this application.</p>
    <p num="p-0209">As another example, the sod strip on each third set conveyor can be 48 inches long by 48 inches wide, and can be cut into four 24 by 24 inch pieces. Alternatively it can be cut into six 16 by 24 inch pieces. The third set conveyors can be divided into subconveyors as needed for the dimensions selected, and the cutting knives can be positioned as needed.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">If desired, the sod strip on each of the third set conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> can be divided into only two pieces (as previously described), or it can be divided into more than three pieces, by using additional cross-cut knives and third set conveyor subsections (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0211">If the sod harvester <b>10</b> is cutting with only one cutting head <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>, then there will be only one third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, divided (for example) into three subconveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a</i>, <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> <i>b</i>, <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> <i>c</i>. In that case, the sod carrier <b>808</b> may be divided into two or three sections across its width, with the sod gripping clamps <b>130</b> of each section being separately operable (e.g. using separate actuating cylinders) to pick up sod. The three sections are indicated at <b>820</b>, <b>822</b>, and <b>824</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> (with the clamp mechanisms omitted for clarity). In that case, the sod carrier <b>808</b> can be positioned with section <b>824</b> over the third set conveyors <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> to cross-cut and pick up a strip of sod on those conveyors. The sod carrier <b>808</b> can then be raised and moved laterally one conveyor width in the direction of arrow <b>826</b>, to bring the center section <b>822</b> of the sod carrier <b>808</b> over the third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>. After the next strip of sod arrives and stops on the third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, the sod carrier <b>808</b> is lowered so that its center section <b>822</b> cross cuts and picks up that strip of sod. The sod carrier <b>808</b> is then stepped once more in the direction of arrow <b>826</b> so that its third section <b>820</b> is located over the third set conveyor <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>, ready to pick up the next sod strip which arrives and stops there. When the sod carrier <b>808</b> has been filled in this manner, it is then moved over a pallet to deposit its sod on the pallet, as previously described.</p>
