    <p>This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/225,251 filed Apr. 8, 1994, now abandoned.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>This invention relates generally to the making of abrasive articles and the like, and is more particularly concerned with the use of soft, flexible and easily deformable powdered pieces as preforms for the manufacture of abrasive articles having abrasive particles therein.</p>
    <p>2. Discussion of the Prior Art</p>
    <p>Powdered preforms are widely used in the manufacture of abrasive articles that include a plurality of abrasive particles such as diamond, cubic boron nitride and the like. Such powdered preforms are conventionally manufactured by compacting powder mixtures of retaining compositions and superabrasives particles in cold presses or roll compactors to form green compacts. Compacting pressure ranges from 300 to 10,000 kg/sq. cm, resulting in 20-50% relative density of the green compacts. Such green compacts are hard, stiff and brittle. The green compacts are then sintered, either with or without pressure, and with or without impregnation.</p>
    <p>There is a method of making abrasive articles wherein a non-compacted mixture of the powdered retaining composition, with a plurality of abrasive particles therein, is placed directly into a sinter mold, then compacted and sintered in the sinter mold. This method requires a lot of adjustments in attempts to spread the powder evenly within the sinter mold. The required adjustments slow the manufacturing process, so the method does not fit well with mass production requirements.</p>
    <p>In all the above mentioned methods, the powdered mixture can contain some binders, but the conventional green compacts are held together, not by the binder, but primarily by interaction among the particles of the powder, e.g. by mechanical interlocking of the particles. The above mentioned methods are widely used to produce traditional cutting, drilling, and grinding abrasive tools and elements of abrasive tool, such as segments for saws and the like.</p>
    <p>There are powdered preforms formed by spraying powder onto a substrate, and fixing the powder to itself and to the substrate by an adhesive, for example by an adhesive spray. Such preforms are flexible, but may experience loss of some powder when flexed. Also, such a method must deal with air borne particles and aerosol sprays that, because of environmental concerns, put serious limitations on the implementation of the method. This method has been used by the present inventor to make articles disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,925,457, 5,049,165, 5,092,910 and 5,190,568, as well as in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/066,475 titled "Patterned Abrasive Material and Method", and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/024,649 titled "Abrasive Cutting Tool".</p>
    <p>Soft and flexible preforms of powders and/or fibers, including both metallic and non-metallic materials, are also known; but, to the knowledge of the present inventor, such preforms are not known in the art of manufacturing articles that include abrasive particles. Presently, the soft and flexible preforms are made by casting, or extruding a composition of brazing filler metal, or ceramic components, or hard facing compositions including metallic components and non-metallic components such as tungsten carbide particles. Such soft and flexible preforms can be bent more than 90°, and can be cut by scissors or the like.</p>
    <p>The earlier known soft and flexible preforms comprise a high content of various binders, up to 95% by volume, and up to 20% by weight. It is the binder that makes such preforms soft and flexible; but, even with the high content of binders, the preforms are flimsy and must be handled with care. This is especially true for the very thin preforms, around 0.005-0.010", or 0.10-0.25 mm.</p>
    <p>It is important to distinguish between the soft and flexible preforms and the products of roll compacting of powders, even in the presence of a binder. When a roll compacted product includes a binder, the binder is in a much smaller quantity than in a flexible preform. The roll compacted product is held together, not by the binder, but by the mechanical interlocking of particles, which makes the roll compacted product much less flexible than the soft and flexible preforms.</p>
    <p>Soft and flexible preforms made of brazing filler metal compositions are used to put some parts together through brazing, mostly through furnace brazing. Soft and flexible preforms made for hard facing compositions are used to repair worn parts. For this purpose, the preforms are applied to a worn spot on the part.</p>
    <p>The brazing process using the soft and flexible preforms made of brazing filler metal has a significant time duration because of the necessity for removal of the substantial quantity of binder. The time for removal of the binder is called the "dewaxing" cycle, and it allows the binder to melt, evaporate, or run out from the preform. It has been found that, if the dewaxing time is shortened or omitted, the powder of the soft and flexible preform can be literally washed out by the liquefied binder.</p>
    <p>In attempting to use the known soft and flexible preforms to hold a plurality of abrasive particles in order to produce abrasive articles, it will be recognized that:</p>
    <p>1. Compositions of the brazing filler preform do not correspond to the desired matrix compositions to hold abrasive particles;</p>
    <p>2. Soft and flexible preforms are not produced with abrasive particles on, or within, the preforms;</p>
    <p>3. Soft and flexible preforms are quite flimsy and not as strong as desired for production of abrasive articles, especially for mass production requirements of abrasive articles requiring thin (0.005-0.020", or 0.1-0.5 mm) flexible preforms;</p>
    <p>4. De-waxing time must be severely reduced to meet production rates, especially for mass production; and,</p>
    <p>5. Heating and/or brazing processes alone do not provide the most reliable matrix for retaining abrasive particles.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention provides a method for manufacturing abrasive articles and wear resistant parts, such articles or parts comprising a plurality of abrasive particles also known as superabrasive particles such as diamond, cubic boron nitride or the like randomly or systematically distributed in a sintered retaining matrix. specifically, the method of the present invention includes the preparation and utilization of powdered preforms in the form of soft, easily deformable flexible (SEDF) bodies that may include a plurality of abrasive particles.</p>
    <p>In making the SEDF preforms, the powdered sinterable compositions will be chosen based on criteria related to the holding necessary for the abrasive particles to be included. Any number of sinterable matrix materials, or powdered compositions may be used. The binder compositions in the form of a liquid that includes a cement in combination with a thinner for the cement will be selected to provide the desired integrity of the final SEDF preform, while maintaining its flexibility and processability. To form an SEDF preform, a slurry or paste is formed of the powdered composition and the binder composition. The concentration of powdered composition and abrasive particles (if included) in the slurry or paste is low, and the volume of the binder composition is high. In fact, the volume of the binder composition or binder phase in the mixture substantially exceeds the volume of the powdered composition and the abrasive particles. Following formation of a substrate with the slurry, the substrate is solidified and cured at room temperature or with heat to evaporate most if not all of the volatile components of the binder phase and form a SEDF preform.</p>
    <p>In one preferred form of the present invention, a porous layer is placed against the SEDF preform. The purpose of the porous layer is to hold the abrasive particles in place during subsequent processing of the material. successful material can be made without the porous layer, but the porous layer provides a better quality product than is obtained without the porous layer.</p>
    <p>Final processing of the SEDF preform of the present invention includes sintering or other heat treating. The result is a high quality abrasive material, with or without a porous layer therein, which can be used for numerous cutting or abrasive tools and the like.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>Referring now more particularly to the drawings, and to those embodiments of the invention here presented by way of illustration, the invention has two major parts: preparation of soft, easily deformed flexible (SEDF) preforms; and, utilization of SEDF preforms for making abrasive articles.</p>
    <heading>Preparation of Preform</heading> <p>The preform is prepared by mixing a binder composition with a sinterable powdered composition or matrix retaining material in the required proportions. The mixture may or may not include a plurality of abrasive particles. Thus, depending on the particular proportions chosen, one may produce the binder-powder mixture in the form of a slurry or a paste.</p>
    <p>Mixing the liquid binder composition with the retaining powder or sinterable matrix material can be performed on a variety of standard equipment, including virtually any equipment suitable for mixing powder and liquid together. Thus, no detailed discussion of the equipment is necessary herein.</p>
    <p>There is a variety of materials that can be used as the binder composition for the preform. The binder composition may be organic or inorganic, but should be selected to carry the particles of the powder, keep the particles suspended, and provide integrity and flexibility to the final preform. It is preferable to choose a binder composition that allows air, a low vacuum, heat, or a combination of these, to evaporate at least some of the volatile components of the binder composition for at least partial curing of the binder composition. Such binder compositions include water soluble cement.</p>
    <p>It is well recognized that the prior art powder technology requires that a person mix powders and abrasive particles. Such powders and abrasive particles become air borne, and are deleterious to the health of workers. Safety masks and the like are available, but are uncomfortable to wear, and of course are not totally effective. The present invention overcomes this difficulty with the prior art in that the powders and abrasive particles can be handled by machines, appropriately covered to minimize the escape of particles. The material is available to be manipulated by people only after mixing powdered components with the liquid binder composition, so there is no longer a hazard of air borne particles.</p>
    <p>Those skilled in the art will understand that many materials will be acceptable as binder compositions, depending on the precise characteristics desired. However, by way of example, the following have been found to be suitable binder compositions: Sanford's Rubber Cement (commercially available from Sanford Corporation, Bellwood, Ill.) in a combination with Carter's Rubber Cement Thinner (commercially available from Dennison Carter's Division, Dennison Manufacturing Company, Framington, Mass.); Nicrocoat Cements (available from Wall Colmanoy Company, Madison Heights, Mich.) in a combination with Exosen No. 40 as a thinner therefor (available from Smithkline Beckman Company, Lewistown, Pa.).</p>
    <p>In the binder-powder mixture, the binder composition is usually 3 to 20% by weight of the mixture, but the ratio can be extended. By volume, the percentage of the powder within the binder-powder mixture is usually from 1 to 5%, but it can be extended to a range of 0.3 to 10%. One successful preform has been formed from a binder-powder mixture or slurry containing from 5.0 to 8.5% by weight of a binder composition consisting of rubber cement and thinner. The sinterable retaining powder is dispersed in the liquid binder composition and held thereby. Abrasive particles may also be dispersed within the binder, and also held therein.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 1 of the drawings, it will be seen that the substrate 10 from which a final SEDF preform of the invention can be made following evaporation of the volatile components such as thinner comprises mostly binder composition 11. There is a plurality of particles 12 of a sinterable retaining powder distributed in the binder composition 11, and there are abrasive particles 14 also distributed in the binder composition. From the above discussion it will be understood that the abrasive particles 14 may or may not be included. This will also be discussed in more detail below.</p>
    <p>Looking at FIG. 2, it will be seen that the substrate 10 comprises the binder composition 11 and retaining powder 12. Abrasive particles 15 are here shown as fixed to a layer 16, the layer 16 then being placed against the substrate 10. The layer 16 may take many forms, including a film having a low melting point or the like, but it is preferably a porous material, which will be discussed in more detail hereinafter.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 shows a modification of FIG. 2, the substrate 10 being substantially the same. The abrasive particles 18 in FIG. 3, however, are placed on the upper surface of the substrate 10. The abrasive particles may be pressed into the substrate 10, or may be held by an adhesive. The adhesive may be the binder composition 11 of the substrate, or may be a separately applied adhesive. Similarly, FIG. 4 shows the arrangement of FIG. 3, but with a carrier 19 having the abrasive particles 20 adhered thereto. The particles 20 on the carrier 19 can therefore be brought into contact with the substrate 10 when desired.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the present invention, the substrates from which the SEDF preforms are made can be formed by spreading a binder-powder mixture on a surface. The mixture may be a slurry, or a paste. The mixture is then cured, e.g. dried, on the surface to remove the volatile components such as thinner and form the SEDF preform and one may use applied heat or pressure if desired.</p>
    <p>In some cases, especially when the abrasive particles are substantially larger than the particles of the retaining powder, or the viscosity of the liquid binder composition is not balanced to suspend the abrasive particles, some measure must be taken to prevent separation or sedimentation of the abrasive particles after mixing has stopped. One might therefore pour immediately after mixing, or combine continuous mixing with simultaneous pouring or coating.</p>
    <p>The abrasive particles in the substrates are not surrounded by closely packed particles of a retaining powder as in the traditional green compacts. Rather, the abrasive particles are suspended predominantly by the binder composition, and in contact with a very few particles of the sinterable retaining powder. This is illustrated in FIGS. 1-4 of the drawings.</p>
    <p>Abrasive particles can be added to the substrate during the process of forming or curing the SEDF preform. By way of example, attention is directed to FIG. 5 of the drawings. A binder-powder mixture 21 is dispensed onto a support surface 22, and doctored to a uniform thickness by a doctor blade 24 to form a substrate 26. After the doctor blade 24, abrasive particles 25 are dispensed onto the surface of the substrate 26. It will be understood that the mixture 21 is not cured at the time the abrasive particles 25 are placed onto the substrate 26 of the mixture, so the particles will be adhered thereto. If desired, or necessary due to the viscosity of the substrate and the weight of the particles 25, pressure can be applied to assist in urging the abrasive particles 25 at least partially into the substrate 26. Also, additional adhesives or the like can be applied as needed. Following addition of the particles 25, the substrate can be cured to remove liquid volatile components from the binder composition and form a SEDF preform.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 illustrates a modification of the arrangement shown in FIG. 5. In FIG. 5, the binder-powder mixture 21 is dispensed onto the support surface 22 and doctored to the desired thickness by doctor blade 24. In FIG. 6, however, the support surface 22 carries a plurality of abrasive particles 28, and the binder-powder mixture is dispensed onto the particles 28. The abrasive particles 28 may be completely covered, or only partially covered by the binder-powder mixture as desired.</p>
    <p>The difference between the thickness of the substrate and the size of the abrasive particles can vary considerably; but, it will be realized that the difference will change significantly in sintering. FIG. 7 shows a substrate 10 having abrasive particles 14 therein. At this stage, the thickness t of the substrate may be equal to 3d to 10d, where d is the dimension of the abrasive particles in the direction of the thickness of the substrate. After curing to form a SEDF preform and sintering, the same is shown in FIG. 8. It will of course be realized that the abrasive particles 14 will not change in size during sintering, but the preform will be significantly condensed. After sintering, the preferable ratio is that the thickness t is approximately equal to the dimension d, the desirable range being t=0.3-2d. It should be mentioned that abrasive particles of all sizes are suitable for use with the technology disclosed herein, but the preferable sizes are from 18 to 324 mesh (about 1.0 mm to about 0.035 mm).</p>
    <p>The weight of the dry sinterable retaining powder per unit. volume of the SEDF preform (grams of powder per cubic centimeter of preform) determines the thickness of the sintered abrasive material, it being realized that the cement of the binder composition will run off, or evaporate, during sintering or other heat processing. For example, the density of cobalt is 8.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and a cobalt preform contains 0.8 g/cm<sup>2</sup> of the dry cobalt powder; therefore, the thickness of the fully densified, sintered product will be about 0.9 mm, which is found by dividing 0.8 g/cm<sup>2</sup> by 8.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. It will be noted that the thickness of the SEDF preform is not in the calculation, this being irrelevant. The important consideration is the quantity of the dry powder per unit area of the preform.</p>
    <p>One technique for production of SEDF preforms of the present invention is--illustrated in FIG. 9. Essentially, a plurality of trays 29 is moved under a hopper 30 which dispenses the binder powder mixture. Each tray 29 will receive a predetermined quantity of the mixture to ultimately provide SEDF preforms of predetermined weight. As shown in FIG. 9, the trays 29 can be placed on a conveyor 31, or may be part of a conveyor 31 which can move continuously, or intermittently, and timed so the binder composition in the mixture will be cured before the SEDF preforms 33 are removed from the trays 29. In the system illustrated, the preforms 33 are received by another conveyor 32 which will carry the preforms to the next processing step. It should be understood that the conveyor 31 can take various geometrical arrangements, including a zig-zag shape in the horizontal plane and a stepped shape in vertical plane.</p>
    <p>In using the system shown in FIG. 9, if an additional layer is desired on the preform, the layer, with or without abrasive particles thereon, can be placed in the bottom of the trays 29. Also, abrasive particles, with or without an additional layer, can be placed on top of the mixture in the trays 29 after the trays are filled to the desired extent.</p>
    <p>It will therefore be realized that the SEDF preforms 33 may be made in the form of discrete plates as shown in FIG. 9, or may be made in the form of continuous tapes as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Either form can then be cut easily with scissors, paper cutter, die cutting or--the like.</p>
    <heading>Preparation of Abrasive Articles</heading> <p>FIG. 10 of the drawings shows the preferred means and method for heating an SEDF preform and sintering the preform. FIG. 10 illustrates a generally conventional sinter fixture for sintering under pressure. It will be seen that there is a bottom punch 34 and a top punch 35, the space between the punches 34 and 35 being closed by the side plates 36. Within the cavity so defined, there is an SEDF preform 38, here shown as having abrasive particles 39 distributed therein, and a plurality of abrasive particles 40 on the top side of the preform 38.</p>
    <p>Those skilled in the art will understand that the punches 34 and 35 will be urged towards each other as indicated by the arrows, and an electric current will be passed through the sinter fixture and/or the preform to heat the preform. An important feature of the present method is that the side plates 36 will tend to restrain lateral movement of the SEDF preform during sintering, even though there may be a flow of liquid as the cement of the binder composition and/or retaining matrix melt and run.</p>
    <p>A further advantage of the SEDF preform in a sintering fixture as shown in FIG. 10 is that the softness of the preform makes redistribution of material quite easy. As a result, variations in thickness and stress can be made uniform simply through the usual pressure on the preform during sintering. The preform therefore has less sensitivity to various nonuniformities, and tends to reduce damage to the sinter molds. The inventor has experienced a 50-fold reduction in consumption of graphite mold parts since using the technique disclosed herein. It should be noted that, because of the softness and deform ability of the SEDF preform, abrasive articles with a corrugated shape can be mass produced without significant consumption of corrugated (hence expensive) punches, e.g. graphite or metal punches.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the sinter mold can be loaded with several assemblies of SEDF preforms, the assemblies being separated from one another by punches and/or separators as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,203,880, "Method and Apparatus for Making Abrasive Tools", by the present inventor. Such sintering "in stock" is illustrated in FIG. 10A. The unique uniformity, softness and deform ability of the SEDF preform make sintering in stock acceptable for mass production technology.</p>
    <p>While the heating of the SEDF preforms under pressure has many advantages, there is one severe disadvantage: the heating melts and vaporizes what is left of the binder composition, which runs; and, the liquid or vapor, intensified by the applied pressure, tends to carry the retaining powder and abrasive particles out of the mold. If most of the retaining powder is washed out of the mold, there will of course be practically no matrix material to hold the left over abrasive particles in place. Also, melted binder composition and/or melted or moved retaining matrix of SEDF preform will catch the abrasive particles, which can be washed out of the mold.</p>
    <p>To solve the problem of the loss of retaining powder and abrasive particles, it has been found that a porous layer can be placed against the SEDF preform to prevent lateral movement of the particles. The porous layer may take many forms, but will not be held together by a binder as used in the SEDF preform. Rather, the porous layer may be screen wire, a conventional compacted preform, egg-crate or reticulated metal structures or the like.</p>
    <p>Looking at FIG. 11, it will be noticed that the abrasive particles 41 are larger than the openings in the porous layer 42. Under pressure, the particles 41 may cut into the porous layer 42. The particles 44 of the retaining powder are smaller than the opening in the layer 42, so these particles will pass easily into the openings of the layer 42.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 11, there is a second porous layer 45 on the opposite side of the SEDF preform; and, the assembly shown in FIG. 11 will be urged together and heated under pressure. The porous layers 42 and 45 will support the abrasive particles and prevent lateral movement (perpendicular to the direction of the applied compaction force), and will provide additional volume to receive the SEDF preform, and restrain lateral motion of the particles of retaining powder in the SEDF preform. The porous layers will also temporarily absorb liquid binder to reduce the flow of binder and thereby help prevent washout of retaining powder and abrasive particles.</p>
    <p>The porous layer, or layers, can be placed in various positions relative to the SEDF preform and other layers of an assembly to be sintered. By way of example, and not by way of limitation; FIG. 12 shows the SEDF preform 46 having a porous layer 48 on one side, and a layer of abrasive particles 49 on the opposite side of the porous layer 48, a substrate, or carrier 50 holding the particles 49 in place. FIG. 13 shows the same arrangement, but the substrate 50 is between the particles 49 and the porous layer 48.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14 shows the SEDF preform 46 in the middle with the porous layer 48 on one side, and the abrasive particles 49 and substrate 50 on the opposite side. FIG. 15 shows the abrasive particles 49 and substrate in the middle, with the SEDF preform 46 on one side, and the porous layer 48 on the opposite side. FIG. 16 is like FIG. 15, except that the positions of the abrasive particles 49 and the substrate 50 are reversed.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17 shows two SEDF preforms 46 and 46'. A porous layer 48 is between the preforms, and the abrasive particles 49 with the substrate 50 are on the opposite side of one of the preforms.</p>
    <p>The porous layer may take the form of a woven mesh, a nonwoven material, expanded foil, knitted materials and textile fabrics. Also, a material that is roll-compacted, extruded, sintered or the like can be used. Virtually any material can be used so long as the material is highly porous (about 30% to 99.5% porosity), having pores open to the surface and interconnected, with sufficient integrity to support the abrasive particles and to restrain motion of the retaining powder in the process of sintering.</p>
    <p>Presently, the best material known for use as porous layers are metallic non-woven materials, and particularly a nickel fiber powder non-woven mat, manufactured by National Standard, Woven Production Division, Corbin, Ky., and sold under the trademark "Fibrex". The porosity of this mat is 85-98%; the fiber is 20 microns in diameter and is about 80 weight percent of the mat, while the powder is about 20 weight percent.</p>
    <p>It has also been found that copper wire mesh, in the range of 20 to 200 mesh, works well as the porous layer. Some expanded metals (manufactured by Delker Corporation) have been used, for the same purpose.</p>
    <p>FIG. 18 of the drawings illustrate an SEDF preform 51 after the preform 51 has been urged against a porous layer 52. The porous layer 52 is here shown as having some substantial thickness, and being made up of a plurality of cells 54 so the porous layer 52 comprises a cellular type of material. It will be seen, then, that the material of the preform 51 has been urged into the cells 54. It has been found desirable in some cases to compress the preform 51 with the porous layer 52 prior to applying heat and pressure during sintering. The material of the preform 51, being received in the openings, or cells, 54 of the porous layer 42 tends to stay within the openings and not to move laterally.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the role of the porous layer 52 can be limited to the restriction of flow of the material of the SEDF preform 51. Thus, a porous layer 52 may be made of a material having a melting point below the sintering temperatures. In this case, after at least a portion of the binder composition has been removed from the preform in the process of heating, and the retaining powder is at least partially solidified, the porous layer will melt onto the preform, and thereby modify the retaining composition. For example, a cobalt-nickel SEDF preform may utilize a porous layer made of copper, bronze, brass, zinc, aluminum, or various combinations of these, as well as other porous layers.</p>
    <p>Another function of a porous layer 52 may be conduction of heat and/or electricity during heating of the preform. For example, a mesh or expanded foil of copper will readily conduct heat or electricity to facilitate uniform heating. Further, the porous layer may include abrasive particles within the cells 54. A preform as shown in FIG. 18 may be placed against a porous layer 52 having abrasive particles therein, or the porous layer may be used as a substrate in an arrangement such as that shown in FIG. 6 of the drawings.</p>
    <p>In any arrangement, it must be realized that, if the porous layer is filled with abrasive particles, the ability of the porous layer to absorb binder composition during heating is reduced. Thus, if one wish to provide a full, or nearly full, layer of abrasive particles through the use of a porous layer, an additional porous layer may be needed, or desired, to absorb the binder and prevent displacement of the retaining powder.</p>
    <p>Looking at FIG. 19 of the drawings, it will be seen that the SEDF preform of the present invention is admirably suited to mass production techniques. The arrangement shown in FIG. 19 includes rolls 55 and 56 for assembling a plurality of layers to be sintered. There is a roll of SEDF preform 58 to form one side of the assembly, and a roll of a carrier 59 to form the opposite side of the assembly. Optionally, a roll of a porous layer 60 is placed between the preform 58 and the carrier 59.</p>
    <p>The carrier 59 may have a plurality of abrasive particles 61 previously placed thereon; or, as here illustrated, a dispenser 62 may place abrasive particles on the carrier 59 during the assembling process. In either case it is contemplated that the carrier 59 will have an adhesive to hold the abrasive particles 61 temporarily.</p>
    <p>The SEDF preform 58 may take many forms as discussed above. The preform 58 may include a plurality of abrasive particles, or may not. Further, the preform may be placed on a supporting layer to give the preform greater integrity.</p>
    <p>The porous layer 60 may or may not be included in the assembly. As is mentioned above, the preform 58 may utilize a porous layer and this may be sufficient for some products. However, if one or more additional porous layers are desired, they may be fed to the assembly as shown in FIG. 19. FIG. 19 also shows separators 66 and 67. Such separators are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,203,880, "Method and Apparatus for Making Abrasive Tools", by the present inventor. In accordance with the disclosure in that patent, these separators assist in protrusion of the abrasive particles through the retaining matrix, and in distribution of the temperature within the sinter mold during the sintering process. These separators 66 and 67 may or may not be attached to the SEDF preform assembly. When attached to the preform, the separators will be part of the assembly itself.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that, in all techniques disclosed in the present application, separators such as the separators 66 and 67 may or may not be used. If separators are used, they may also be utilized as the surface on which the SEDF preforms are formed (see numeral 22 in FIGS. 5 and 6). It should be understood that, in the majority of the figures in the drawings, separators are not shown for the sake of simplification of the illustration.</p>
    <p>Those skilled in the art will understand that the rolls 55 and 56 will urge the layers 58, 59 and 60, and separators 66 and 67 together into a single assembly 64. It is contemplated that the assembly 64 will then be cut into discrete pieces, or plates, 65 by a cutter 69. The individual plates 65 can be received by a conveyer 68 for transport to means for sintering.</p>
    <heading>Examples</heading> <p>FIGS. 20 and 21 of the drawings show one assembly and one resulting sintered abrasive material respectively in accordance with the present invention. There is an SEDF preform 75 having abrasive particles 71 distributed therein. On the opposite side of the assembly is an SEDF preform 72 without abrasive particles. Between these two outside layers, there are two additional preforms 70 and 74, both having abrasive particles distributed therein. Then, between the preforms 70 and 74 there is a porous layer 76; and between the preforms 74 and 75 there is a porous layer 78.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 21 it can be seen that the abrasive particles remain in layers; and, on one side, the abrasive particles 71 are at the surface of the sintered assembly, while on the opposite side the preform 72 provides a backing without abrasive particles. This sintered abrasive material can now be used to manufacture cutting and grinding tools.</p>
    <p>The SEDF preform may have a profiled shape, which may or may not correspond to the shape of a compacting means, e.g. punches used for providing pressure during sintering. The profiled SEDF preform, along with the non-profiled, or flat ones, are utilized by the present inventor for manufacturing abrasive articles according to U.S. Pat. No. 5,190,568 titled "Abrasive Tool with Contoured Surface".</p>
    <p>FIG. 19A illustrates a one-sided profiled SEDF preform. One way to manufacture the one-sided profiled SEDF preform includes the use of a profiled substrate 111, the binder-powder mixture 112 being poured onto the substrate 111 and then cured to form an SEDF preform thereon.</p>
    <p>FIG. 19B, illustrates the formation of a two-sided profiled SEDF preform. FIG. 19B shows two substrates, or walls, 114 and 115 and a SEDF preform 116 between the walls 114 and 115. According to the method illustrated in FIG. 19B, the two-sided profiled SEDF preform is manufactured by pouring a binder-powder mixture in the form of a slurry between the two profiled walls 114 and 115, and then curing the slurry resulting in the formation of the two-sided profiled SEDF preform 116.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that wall 114 and wall 115 may have different profiles, and each side of the SEDF preform has a profile corresponding to the profile (relief) of the respective wall. It also should be understood that the walls can be positioned vertically or horizontally; and, application of pressure and/or changing the distance between the walls in the process of solidification of the binder-powder mixture are optional.</p>
    <p>A non-profiled, or flat, SEDF preform can be converted prior to sintering into a profiled one. The flat profile 118 can be shaped between profiled compacting means. FIG. 19C illustrates one of the processes for shaping a flat SEDF preform 118 into a profiled SEDF preform 119 by two profiled rolls or gears 120 and 121. The preferable arrangement does not require change of the thickness of the SEDF preform as a result of the shaping. This type of shaping does not require very great pressure because of the easy deform ability of the SEDF preform.</p>
    <p>FIG. 20 also, shows separators 66a and 67a placed against SEDF preforms 70 and 72 as a part of the assembly itself. FIG. 21 does not show these separators, indicating that at least some of the separators have been removed from the sintered abrasive material in the process of after-sintering cleaning, or in the process of dressing the abrasive tool.</p>
    <p>One method for utilization of the separators in combination with the SEDF preform is shown in FIG. 20A. The separator 100 is placed on one side of the assembly 103 that includes an SEDF preform 101, a layer of porous material 102 and a layer of abrasive particles 104 on a carrier 105. A mesh type material 196 having openings 108 is applied against the separator 109; and, the preferable mesh type material 106 has orderly distributed openings 108. Under pressure provided by one or both of punches 35a and 35b, the assembly 103 extrudes at least partially into openings 108 of the mesh type material 106, deforming the separator 109 and leaving imprints on the surface of the assembly 103. The whole assembly 103 is put into the sintering mold as is shown in FIGS. 10 and 10A, and then sintered, providing that sintering under pressure is preferable. The pressure to extrude the assembly 103 into the openings 108 can be applied prior to sintering, outside of the sinter mold and/or within this sinter mold, and/or in the process of sintering. After sintering the mesh type material 106 is removed from the mold, as well as the separator 109. The removal of the mesh type material 106 from the sintered abrasive article is not a problem because the separator 109 prevents diffusion between the assembly 103 and the mesh type material 106. The resulting abrasive article will comprise a profile corresponding to the design of the mesh type material 106.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that there are additional options (some being shown in FIG. 20A) that may or may not be implemented: the mesh type material 106 can be placed against both sides of the SEDF preform 101 for making two-sided profiled abrasive article (see separator 100 in FIG. 20A); another separator 110 can be used to separate mesh type material 106 from the punch 35a, and separator 100 can be used to separate another side of the assembly 103 from the punch 35b. It also should be understood that several assemblies comprising SEDF preforms and the mesh material for extrusion can be sintered in stock as is shown in FIG. 10A. Furthermore, separators of different thicknesses and different types can be used for opposite sides of the SEDF preform 101. The mesh type material 106 for extrusion can be made from different materials, e.g. steel woven mesh, expanded metal, machined crags, honeycomb or the like. It is also preferable that openings in the mesh 106 be big enough to allow at least one abrasive particle 104 to go therethrough. For example, diamonds have sizes of 0.015 to 0.200 mm (80-100 mesh) while the mesh type material for extrusion comprises openings of 1.00 to 0.850 mm (18 to 20 mesh). It is also preferable that the mesh type material 106 for extrusion does nob melt under sintering temperatures, and have a minimum preformability under the pressure that makes this mesh multiusable.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 22 and 23 of the drawings show an assembly and a sintered single layer cutting tool respectively. FIG. 22 illustrates the layers to be assembled, and includes a central porous layer 79 having a plurality of abrasive particles 80 in the openings thereof. It should be noticed that the particles 80 are at least as wide as the layer 79, so the particles 80 extend completely through the porous layer 79.</p>
    <p>Each side of the central layer 79 includes two-SEDF preforms 81, 82 and 81', 82', separated by porous layers 84, 84'.</p>
    <p>When the assembly is heated under pressure, the material shown in FIG. 23 results. The present inventor has used this method to produce abrasive articles with one layer of diamonds as shown. It should be understood, however, that the abrasive article can include as many layers as desired, in accordance with other disclosures herein.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 24 and 25 show the production of a no-diamond foot on a conventional diamond segment. Current methods are difficult to use because the foot 85 is quite thin, requiring that powder be distributed very thinly, yet very uniformly, in a sinter mold. Using the methods and apparatus of the present invention, however, an SEDF preform 86 can be placed against the segment 88, and the retaining powder is readily distributed uniformly. As is discussed in detail above, the final thickness of the foot 85 car be easily calculated.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 26 and 27 show the use of a conventional green compact having randomly distributed abrasive particles in combination with SEDF preforms of the present invention, and porous layers having orderly arranged abrasive particles. The central green compact 89 has a porous layer 90, 90' on each side thereof, then an SEDF preform 91, 91'. The outside comprises a porous, or cellular, layer 92, 92' having a plurality of abrasive particles 94, 94' distributed therein in an orderly fashion.</p>
    <p>The assembly of FIG. 26 can be compressed in the direction indicated by the arrows 95, or in the direction indicated by the arrows 96 to form the product shown in FIG. 27. The inventor has used this technique, with pressure in the direction of the arrows 95, to manufacture diamond segments for saw blades, and a ream saw blade.</p>
    <p>FIG. 28 illustrates the making of a cut-off disk. Individual pieces 98, or a complete ring, of the SEDF preform can be prepared of the proper shape, and placed around the periphery of a core 99. From the foregoing discussion it will be understood that the pieces 98 may include any number of layers, may or may not include porous layers, and may have as many or as few abrasive particles as desired.</p>
    <p>After the pieces 98, or the ring, is assembled on the core 99, the assembly will be sintered (preferably under pressure) so the sintering of the preform and fixing the preform to the core 99 are performed in one step.</p>
    <p>Following are some specific examples of use of the technology of the present invention:</p>
    <p>1. a) Make an SEDF preform in the form of a plate or a tape from a binder composition and diamond retaining composition, e.g., from Wall Colmonoy's setting powder 50, or from Kennametal's powder N50, or from any other sinterable powdered composition suitable for use with abrasive articles. Do not mix these retaining powders with diamonds in the process of making SEDF preform.</p>
    <p>b) Cut the preform with paper cutter or scissors into the shape suitable for the sintering mold and design of the abrasive articles.</p>
    <p>c) Put diamonds into openings of the mesh type material and temporarily retain them with an adhesive carrier. As an option, the mesh type material can be then removed.</p>
    <p>d) Apply SEDF preform against the carrier that includes abrasive particles. As an option, pressure and/or adhesive can be applied to hold the assembly together. As another option, separators can be placed on at least one side of the assembly as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,203,880, "Method and Apparatus for Making Abrasive Tools".</p>
    <p>e) Place the assembly into a heating device e.g., between heating plates or into a sintering mold. It can be several assemblies per one device.</p>
    <p>f) Heat the assembly under a pressure, e.g., up to 1040° C. and 300 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, so called "hot compacting".</p>
    <p>g) Remove the sintered assembly from the device, clean and cut, if necessary, into pieces required by the design, then mount the pieces on a carrier, if necessary, to make the final product.</p>
    <p>2. a) Make an SEDF preform in the form of a plate or a tape from a slurry mixture of a binder composition, diamond particles and a diamond retaining composition, e.g., from Wall Colmonoy's setting powder 50, or from Kennametal's powder N50, or from any other sinterable powdered composition suitable for use with abrasive articles.</p>
    <p>b) Cut the preform with paper cutter or scissors into the shape suitable for the sintering mold and design of the abrasive articles.</p>

    <p>It should be understood that the preferred embodiments of the invention here presented comprise assemblies of abrasive particles such as diamonds, cubic boron nitride or the like, distributed in an orderly fashion on a substrate, or a carrier, and a pre-made SEDF preform formed from metals, ceramics, epoxy materials with binders or other plastics. The assemblies of the above components are heated or sintered, preferably under an external pressure. The SEDF preform may or may not include randomly distributed abrasive particles therein; and, and a separator can be a part of the assembly itself to prevent contacting and/or diffusion between the SEDF preforms and the molding parts.</p>
    <p>It will of course be understood by those skilled in the art that the particular embodiments of the invention here presented</p>
    <p>are by way of illustration only, and are meant to be in no way restrictive; therefore, numerous changes and modifications may be made, and the full use of equivalents resorted to, without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as outlined in the appended claims.</p>
