    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a radiotherapy apparatus and more specifically to a radiotherapy apparatus used for stereotactic radiotherapy.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0005">A radiotherapy apparatus for treating cancers and tumors using radiation is known. As a 3-dimensional irradiation radiotherapy apparatus which irradiates stereotactic multi-path radiotherapy apparatus, radio-surgery therapy apparatus, lineac (medical linear accelerator) therapy apparatus, and others are known in “Radiotherapy physics”, by Takehiro Nishidai, (Bunkodo, Feb. 26, 2001, pp. 95–153) and “Radiotherapy Manual”, by Masahiro Hiraoka, Keishi Sasai, and Toshihiko Inoue, (Chugai-Igakusha, Apr. 10, 2001, pp. 19–63).</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Now, stereotactic multi-path irradiation is radiotherapy to irradiate radiation concentratedly to a small seat of disease from multi-directions to achieve radiotherapy effects, and at the same time, to hold the exposure dose of the surrounding tissues to the minimum. The therapy indicates its greatest force in radiotherapy of primary benign brain tumors, solitary metastatic brain tumors not larger than 3 cm in size, minor lesion in a brain such as skull base metastasis which is difficult to operate, or arterial malformation or venous maloperation, and others.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">The radiosurgery therapy apparatus irradiates thin radiation beams to a predetermined small area from one or multiple radiation irradiation units fixed to therapy apparatus. As radiation irradiating units, a gamma ray source or lineac is used. In the radiosurgery therapy apparatus, the diseased part of a patient such as skull or the peripheral regions are mechanically fixed by using a precision positioning/diseased part fixing jig, which is a fixing tool for stereotactic radiation irradiation. This frame is used as a coordinate reference jig for positioning, and diagnostic images are obtained using X-ray CT (computed tomography), MRI, and the like, and the exact position and shape of the diseased part are deduced. The patient is mechanically fixed as-framed to an irradiation apparatus which includes one or multiple radiation irradiation units and a collimater mechanism that collimates and concentrates the therapeutic radiation to a small region. By this, the radiation field is accurately adjusted to the small region mechanically, and precise stereotactic irradiation is carried out. In the radiosurgery therapy apparatus, radiation (X-ray) for radiotherapy is irradiated based on the diagnostic images filmed in advance. That is, a diagnostic X-ray system for observation of the diseased part in real time (X-ray generating unit—image detector) is not provided, and the radiation is never irradiated while observing the diseased part in real time.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">In the lineac therapy apparatus, isocentric radiotherapy is carried out by rotating a large-size gantry 360 degrees around an axis parallel to the installation surface. In addition to this, by adding vertical movement, 2-dimensional movement in horizontal planes and rotation in the same horizontal plane of the therapeutic bed, diversified irradiations are enabled. In the lineac therapy apparatus, high-speed position control is not possible. Consequently, real-time follow-up irradiation to a therapeutic field which moves at a high speed as movement due to heart pulses is not possible. In addition, as a monitoring section of a radiation field under irradiation, linacgraphy of transmitted radiation of the therapeutic X-rays is used. Because the therapeutic X-ray provides strong permeability and has many scattering radiations, the picture quality for real-time monitor of the radiation field is not superior. In the lineac therapy apparatus, there is a method for following markers mounted to the diseased part by the diagnostic X-ray system, estimating the position of the diseased part, and irradiating the radiation when the estimated position overlaps the radiation field (body-in-motion tracking irradiation). Now, the diagnostic X-ray system includes a diagnostic X-ray generating unit mounted to the ceiling and an image detector mounted to the lower part of the lineac therapy apparatus. In this method, it is not practiced to grasp the position of the actual diseased part in real-time and to irradiate radiation to it while tracking in such a manner that the actual position of the diseased part overlaps the radiation field. Because the X-ray generating unit is fixed to the ceiling, the distance with the image detector is large. In addition, there is a case that the image detector enters the shadow of a main body of the lineac therapy apparatus, so that the diagnostic X-ray from the X-ray generating unit may not reach the image detector. To cope with it, a slightly larger number of X-ray generating units are mounted to the ceiling, and two usable ones are selected to use. Furthermore, the image detector is installed in the region to which transmission X-ray (the therapeutic X-ray that penetrated the diseased part) and scattering X-ray (the therapeutic X-ray that are scattered in the diseased part) are directed.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In conjunction with the above description, stereotactic surgical apparatuses and methods are disclosed in PCT International Patent Applications (International Application Nos. PCT/US91/07696, and PCT/US93/11872).</p>
    <p num="p-0010">One of these stereotactic surgical apparatuses is an apparatus which isocentrically drives electronic therapeutic X-ray lineac, and the electronic lineac is provided to a tip section of a general-purpose industrial robot arm. This apparatus essentially achieves non-isocentric irradiation therapy by free moving capabilities of the robot arm with six degrees of freedom. The exact shape and position of the diseased part are determined by X-ray CT and/or MRI in advance and are inferred by relating them to landmark body tissue such as the skull and the breast and markers embedded in or in the vicinity of the diseased part (e.g., a small-size gold plate embedded in the diseased part). The therapeutic X-ray is precisely irradiated while the stereotactic surgical apparatus monitors the movement of the landmark by the two diagnostic X-ray systems with different visual lines at the time of the therapeutic irradiation, and corrects the sight of the therapeutic X-ray. It takes 1 to 2 seconds to correct the sight and 0.5 to 1 second for irradiation time. Of these two diagnostic X-ray systems, the X-ray generating unit is firmly secured to the ceiling. The image receiver (image detector) that receives the transmitted X-ray is disposed to the lower part of the bed. That is, the X-ray generating unit is located considerably distant from the image detector. In addition, due to the rotation of the lineac therapy apparatus, the image detector enters the shade of the apparatus and diagnostic X-rays from the X-ray generating unit may not reach the image detector. On the other hand, the image receiver is located on the opposite side to the therapeutic X-ray irradiating apparatus with respect to the bed. That is, the image receiver is installed in a region where transmitted X-ray or scattered X-ray are directed.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">The other of the above stereotactic surgical apparatuses is an apparatus that drives the electronic lineac along the gantry, and two diagnostic X-ray systems (X-ray generating unit-image receiver) and an electronic lineac are provided to the gantry. By allowing the electronic lineac to rotate not only around one axis in the horizontal direction but also around one axis in the vertical direction, three-dimensional irradiation can be achieved. However, the irradiation system is isocentric. In this stereotactic surgical apparatus, too, the exact shape and position of the diseased part are determined by means such as the X-ray CT are inferred by relating them to the landmark body tissues or the markers embedded in or in the vicinity of the diseased part. The therapeutic beams are precisely irradiated while the stereotactic surgical apparatus monitors the movement of the landmark by using the two diagnostic X-ray systems with different visual lines at the time of the therapeutic irradiation, and corrects the sight of the beam. It takes 1 to 2 seconds for time to correct the sight and 0.5 to 1 second for irradiation time.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">These two diagnostic X-ray systems are installed on the gantry to which the electronic lineac is installed. In the same manner, the X-ray generating unit is installed on the gantry on the electronic lineac side distant from the electronic lineac. In addition, the image receiver is located on the gantry on the opposite side of the X-ray generating unit with respect to the diseased part. That is, the image receiver is installed in the region where transmitted or scattering beams are directed.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In general, the diseased part of a patient moves even during radiotherapy. In particular, in a diseased part below the neck, an irradiation subject such as a tumor is constantly moving due to the movements and state of organs such as breathing, heart pulses, vermiculation, and urine volume in a bladder. For example, when the patient lies down only, the body gradually becomes flat. In addition, though breathing and heart pulses are cyclic movements, movements of organs associated with them do not always pass the same route every time.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">The movement of the irradiated subject is intended to be accurately caught in real time, and the heart pulse, which is one of the quickest movements, is 1 to 2 times/sec. Consequently, in order to obtain accurate tracking of the movement in real time, it is said that a technique to obtain diagnostic images at about 30 images per second is required. If the irradiated subject is accurately tracked in real time and radiation is irradiated, it is necessary to direct the radiation irradiating head accurately to the irradiated subject every 1/30 second. In addition, in order to obtain a high-quality diagnostic image for tracking, it is important to eliminate the effect of the therapeutic radiation (X-rays) to the image detector of the diagnostic X-ray system.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0015">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a radiotherapy apparatus that can monitor a therapeutic field state in real time even during radiation irradiating radiotherapy.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">Another object of the present invention is to provide a radiotherapy apparatus that can eliminate influence of therapeutic radiation (X-ray) on an image detector of a diagnostic X-ray system.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a radiotherapy apparatus that can irradiate radiation to a therapeutic field while tracking the therapeutic field even when the therapeutic field moves during radiotherapy.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a radiotherapy apparatus that can quickly adjust a sight from a wide range of region in addition to irradiation around one-rotation axis or isocentric irradiation.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">Another object of the present invention is to provide a radiotherapy apparatus that can precisely irradiate radiation to a diseased part while alleviating burdens on a patient, resulting in improvement of therapeutic effects.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">In an aspect of the present invention, a radiotherapy apparatus includes an irradiation head section, an X-ray source section and a sensor array section. The irradiation head section irradiates therapeutic radiation to a therapeutic field of a target substance. The X-ray source section irradiates diagnostic X-rays to the therapeutic field of the target subject. The sensor array section detects the diagnostic X-rays which have transmitted the target subject, and outputs diagnostic X-ray image data based on the detected diagnostic X-rays. The sensor array section moves in conjunction with movement of the irradiation head section.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">Here, the X-ray source section preferably moves in conjunction with the movement of the sensor array section.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">Also, the sensor array section is preferably provided in a vicinity of the irradiation head section. In this case, the sensor array section preferably includes sensor arrays provided on both sides of the irradiation head section.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">Also, it is preferable that a distance between each of the X-ray source section and the sensor array section and an isocenter is smaller than a distance between the irradiation head and the isocenter.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">Also, the X-ray source section and the sensor array section are preferably provided at positions symmetrical to each other with respect to the isocenter.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">Also, it is preferable that the irradiation head section is movably provided for any one of a C-type gantry and a Ω type gantry, which have a rail track on which the irradiation head section moves, and an L type gantry and a robot arm, which move with the irradiation head section held.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">Also, it is preferable that the irradiation head section is movably provided to an O-type gantry, which has a rail track on which the irradiation head section moves. In this case, the X-ray source section and the sensor array section are preferably provided inside a ring of the O-type gantry.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">Also, the radiotherapy apparatus may further include a control unit, an image processing unit and a head swing mechanism. The image processing unit generates diagnostic images of the therapeutic field based on the diagnostic X-ray image data. The head swing mechanism swings the irradiation head section such that the therapeutic radiation outputted from the irradiation head section follows the movement of the therapeutic field. The irradiation head section is movably coupled to the O-type gantry. The control unit carries out position control of the head swing mechanism based on the diagnostic images, a position of the irradiation head section, and a swing state of the irradiation head section, such that the irradiated field of the irradiation head section tracks the therapeutic field, and controls the irradiation head section to irradiate the therapeutic radiation after the position control of the head swing mechanism. In this case, the control unit may calculate a first coordinate as a coordinate of the therapeutic field in the diagnostic images based on a predetermined image pattern indicating the therapeutic field on the diagnostic images, calculate a second coordinate as a coordinate of the irradiated field based on the position of the radiation head section and the swing state of the irradiation head section, and carry out the positional control of the head swing mechanism such that the therapeutic field is contained in the irradiated field based on the first and second coordinates. In this case, the control unit may carry out the position control of the head swing mechanism and the control of the irradiation head section for every predetermined time period. Also, the head swing mechanism swings the irradiation head section around two axes orthogonal to each other.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">Also, the radiotherapy apparatus may further include a head circumferential moving mechanism configured to move the irradiation head section along a ring of the O-type gantry.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Also, the radiotherapy apparatus may further include a gantry rotating mechanism configured to rotate the O-type gantry around a vertical axis.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">Also, the radiotherapy apparatus may further include a microwave generating unit configured to generate microwaves and a waveguide configured to couple the microwave generating unit and the irradiation head section and to guide the microwaves from the microwave generating unit to the irradiation head section. In this case, the microwave belongs to a C band, and the irradiation head section comprises an accelerator tube configured to accelerate electrons of an electron beam with the microwave. Also, the microwave belongs to an X band, and the irradiation head section comprises an accelerator tube configured to accelerate electrons of an electron beam with the microwave.</p>

In the drawings, a part of the structure of the radiotherapy apparatus is omitted. Coordinate axes <b>200</b> indicate a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system which has X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">A radiotherapy apparatus <b>6</b>A includes a therapeutic bed system <b>7</b>, an X-ray head <b>10</b>, a support frame <b>67</b>-<b>1</b>, a support frame <b>67</b>-<b>2</b>, an O-type gantry <b>69</b>, a movement following type waveguide tube system <b>61</b>, a microwave generating unit <b>20</b>, and a real-time imager <b>74</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">The therapeutic bed system <b>7</b> includes a bed driving system <b>7</b>-<b>1</b>, a therapeutic bed <b>7</b>-<b>2</b>, and a patient fixing apparatus <b>7</b>-<b>3</b>. The therapeutic bed <b>7</b>-<b>2</b> is loaded with a patient <b>4</b> who undergoes radiotherapy, and is moved to a specific position in the apparatus <b>6</b>A. The patient fixing apparatus <b>7</b>-<b>3</b> fixes the patient <b>4</b> to the therapeutic bed <b>7</b>-<b>2</b>. The bed driving system <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> can move the therapeutic bed <b>7</b>-<b>2</b> in three-axial directions of X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis. The bed driving system <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> can adjust the position of the therapeutic bed <b>7</b>-<b>2</b> so that the diseased part <b>5</b> as a therapeutic field is located at an isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>based on photographed image data from the real-time imager <b>74</b> under the control of a system control unit <b>80</b> to be described later. For the therapeutic bed <b>7</b>-<b>2</b> and the patient fixing apparatus <b>7</b>-<b>3</b>, material and shape are selected in such a manner that are suited for the use of an image diagnosis apparatus as the real-time imager <b>74</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">The O-type gantry <b>69</b> includes a ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b>, O-type driving rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b>, a gantry rotating mechanism <b>72</b>, and an upper support mechanism <b>82</b>. The O-type gantry <b>69</b> (main body) is installed to surround the periphery of the therapeutic bed <b>7</b>-<b>2</b>, and is composed of a pipe with a rectangular cross section and formed in a circular ring. The O-type gantry <b>69</b> is installed on the gantry rotating mechanism <b>72</b> to be upright with respect to the horizontal plane (XY plane). The therapeutic bed <b>7</b>-<b>2</b> and the X-ray head <b>10</b> are disposed so that the circle center comes to the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0063">The gantry rotating mechanism <b>72</b> includes a foundation section <b>72</b>-<b>1</b>, a rotating section <b>72</b>-<b>2</b>, and a driving section <b>72</b>-<b>3</b>. The foundation section <b>72</b>-<b>1</b> is fixedly installed to a bottom surface (a floor surface, etc.). The rotating section <b>72</b>-<b>2</b> is rotatably installed on the foundation section <b>72</b>-<b>1</b>, and fixedly holds the O-type gantry <b>69</b>. The driving section <b>72</b>-<b>3</b> rotates the rotating section <b>72</b>-<b>2</b> and the O-type gantry on it. That is, around a first rotating axis J<b>1</b> as an axis in the vertical direction (Z-axis direction), the O-type gantry <b>69</b> is rotated as shown by I<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this case, the first rotating axis J<b>1</b> overlaps the diameter of a circle of the O-type gantry <b>69</b> and passes the circle center as the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0064">The O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> are rings which have inside diameters and outside diameters similar to those of the O-type gantry <b>69</b>. The O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> are rotatably provided to the O-type gantry <b>69</b> in a concentric manner and parallel manner to the circle of the O-type gantry <b>69</b> to put the O-type gantry <b>69</b> therebetween. The O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> rotate to the O-type gantry <b>69</b> around a second rotating axis J<b>2</b> which is perpendicular to the plane of the O-type gantry <b>69</b> and which is perpendicular to the first rotating axis J<b>1</b> and passes the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, as shown by <b>12</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At this time, the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> rotate integrally with the ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">The ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b> is movably connected with the O-type gantry <b>69</b> and fixedly with the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b>. Thus, the mechanism <b>70</b> moves the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> along the O-type gantry <b>69</b> in the circumferential direction as shown by <b>12</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b> may include the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b>. A rack and pinion system, belt system, and the like may be adopted for the ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">The upper support mechanism <b>82</b> has a foundation section <b>82</b>-<b>1</b> and a rotating section <b>82</b>-<b>2</b>. The foundation section <b>82</b>-<b>1</b> is fixedly installed to an upper section (ceiling, etc.). The rotating section <b>82</b>-<b>2</b> is rotatably installed below the foundation section <b>82</b>-<b>1</b> and holds the O-type gantry <b>69</b> from the above direction. That is, the rotating section <b>82</b>-<b>2</b> supports the rotation of the gantry rotating mechanism <b>72</b> around the first rotating axis J<b>1</b> in the top section of the O-type gantry <b>69</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">The O-type gantry <b>69</b> can rotate for 160 degrees around the first rotating axis J<b>1</b>. In addition, the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> can rotate for 360 degrees on the O-type gantry <b>69</b>. That is, the sections such as an X-ray head <b>10</b> to be described later fixed to the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> are moved in such a manner as to draw an 8/9 sphere ( 8/9 spherical shell) with the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>as a center. The O-type gantry <b>69</b>, the ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b>, the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b>, and the gantry rotating mechanism <b>73</b> are formed of material with a large rigidity, for example, stainless steel. The O-type gantry <b>69</b> (main body) is 200–400 mm wide, 100–200 mm thick, and 1200–2000 mm in radius from the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0068">The X-ray head <b>10</b> is a radiation irradiating head which irradiates the therapeutic X-rays <b>3</b> <i>a </i>to a radiation field <b>5</b>′ (diseased part <b>5</b>). The X-ray head <b>10</b> has a small-size electron lineac which irradiates the therapeutic X-rays <b>3</b> <i>a</i>. The X-ray head <b>10</b> is movably installed to the O-type gantry <b>69</b> via the O-type drive ring <b>71</b>, the support frame <b>67</b>-<b>1</b> to be described later and a support frame <b>67</b>-<b>2</b> to be described later. The X-ray head <b>10</b> has a support frame <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">The support frame <b>102</b> includes a first swing mechanism <b>131</b> and a second swing mechanism <b>132</b>. The first swing mechanism <b>131</b> is a mechanism to vibrate or turn the X-ray head <b>10</b> around a first swing axis S<b>1</b> on the O-type gantry <b>69</b> as shown by R<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The first swing axis S<b>1</b> is provided on the axis that nearly passes the inertia center of the X-ray head <b>10</b> or in the vicinity of it so that the inertia becomes small when the X-ray head <b>10</b> is swung. The second swing mechanism <b>132</b> is a mechanism to oscillate or turn the X-ray head <b>10</b> around the second swing axis S<b>2</b> on the O-type gantry <b>69</b> as shown in by R<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The second swing axis S<b>2</b> is provided on the axis that nearly passes the inertia center of the X-ray head <b>10</b> or in the vicinity of it so that the inertia becomes small when the X-ray head <b>10</b> is swung. The detail will be discussed later.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">Also, a sensor array <b>78</b>A and a sensor array <b>78</b>B are fixedly held by a holding frame <b>76</b>A and a holding frame <b>76</b>B. The support frame <b>67</b>-<b>1</b> is fixedly connected to the O-type drive ring <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> on one side and to the support frame <b>102</b> on the other side. The support frame <b>67</b>-<b>2</b> is fixedly connected to O-type drive ring <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> on one side and to a portion opposite to a connection between the support frame <b>102</b> and the support frame <b>67</b>-<b>1</b> in the support frame <b>102</b> on the other side. That is, the support frame <b>67</b>-<b>1</b> and the support frame <b>67</b>-<b>2</b> hold the X-ray head <b>10</b> on the inner circumferential side of the O-type gantry <b>69</b>. The support frame <b>67</b>-<b>1</b> and the support frame <b>67</b>-<b>2</b> rotate together with the X-ray head <b>10</b> held by the support frame <b>102</b> in accordance with the rotation of the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> by the ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">The real-time imager <b>74</b> (sensor arrays <b>78</b>A and <b>78</b>B) detects images of the diagnostic X-rays <b>3</b> <i>b </i>which have transmitted the patient <b>4</b> when the diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>as a weak fan beam X-ray is irradiated to the therapeutic field of the patient <b>4</b> from the two directions (X-ray sources <b>77</b>A and <b>77</b>B). An image processing is carried out on the detected images by an image processing unit <b>31</b> and a 3-dimensional tomography image of the therapeutic field or diseased part <b>5</b> is displayed on a computer screen. The real-time imager <b>74</b> is controlled by a system control unit <b>80</b>. The real-time imager <b>74</b> includes 2 sets of the X-ray sources <b>77</b>A and <b>77</b>B and the sensor arrays <b>78</b>A and <b>78</b>B like usual x-ray cameras, a holding section <b>68</b> that holds the X-ray sources <b>77</b>A and <b>77</b>B, and holding frames <b>76</b>A and <b>76</b>B that hold the sensor arrays <b>78</b>A and <b>78</b>B. The holding section <b>68</b> (<b>68</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>68</b>-<b>2</b>) is fixedly held to O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> on one side. Also, the other side thereof is held to have the X-ray sources <b>77</b>A and <b>77</b>B on both sides, and to aim at the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>while sandwiching a plane formed from the first rotating axis J<b>1</b> and the second rotating axis J<b>2</b>. Furthermore, the holding section <b>68</b> has a protection plate <b>75</b> at the top to absorb the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>penetrating the patient <b>4</b>. The X-ray sources <b>77</b>A and <b>77</b>B are moved in conjunction with the motion of the X-ray head <b>10</b> (motion of the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0072">The holding frame <b>76</b>A has one end extending downward from one side surface of the X-ray head <b>10</b> (holding frame <b>102</b>). The sensor array <b>78</b>A is connected to the other end of the frame <b>76</b> <i>a</i>. Similarly, the holding frame <b>76</b>B has one end extending downward from one side surface of the X-ray head <b>10</b> (holding frame <b>102</b>). The sensor array <b>78</b>B is connected to the other end of the frame <b>76</b>B. The X-ray source <b>77</b>A and the X-ray source <b>77</b>B are mounted to the holding section <b>68</b>. The two sources are located on the positions opposite to each other while putting the plane formed from the first rotating axis J<b>1</b> and the second rotating axis J<b>2</b> therebetween. The sensor array <b>78</b>A and the sensor array <b>78</b>B are similar to the sources. Because the diagnostic images are obtained by irradiating the diagnostic X-rays <b>3</b> <i>b </i>from two directions, the motion of each portion of the body of the patient <b>4</b> can be quickly and accurately grasped. Also, the real-time imager <b>74</b>, the O-type drive rings <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>71</b>-<b>2</b>, and the O-type gantry <b>69</b> are mechanically and tightly connected and have a common coordinate reference.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">The sensor array <b>78</b>A is mounted to one end of the holding frame <b>76</b>A. The sensor array <b>78</b>A is located near the X-ray head <b>10</b> but is disposed with care to prevent the sensor array <b>78</b>A from interfering with the course of the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>which is irradiated from the X-ray head <b>10</b>. Therefore, the sensor array <b>78</b>A does not receive the strong X-rays from the X-ray head <b>10</b>. The perpendicular line from the center portion of the light-receiving surface of the sensor is directed to the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, and the X-ray source <b>77</b>A is disposed on the extension line. Similarly, the sensor array <b>78</b>B is mounted on one end of the holding frame <b>76</b>B. The sensor array <b>78</b>B is located near the X-ray head <b>10</b> but is disposed with care to prevent it from interfering with the course of the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>which is irradiated from the X-ray head <b>10</b>. Therefore, the sensor array <b>78</b>B does not receive strong X-rays from the X-ray head <b>10</b>. The perpendicular line from the center portion of the light-receiving surface of the sensor is directed to the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, and the X-ray source <b>77</b>B is disposed on the extension line.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The sensor arrays <b>78</b>A and <b>78</b>B receive the diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>which penetrates the patient <b>4</b>. The sensor arrays <b>78</b>A and <b>78</b>B are fixedly disposed on the circumference of a circle with the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>as the center, and the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>surrounds the diagnostic space to which the patient <b>4</b> is located. Each sensor array <b>78</b>A or <b>78</b>B is provided with a large number of super high-sensitivity CdTe sensors, and has 0.5 mm resolution. Also, the irradiation time of diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is 0.0025 to 0.01 seconds per shot.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">The distance between each of the X-ray sources <b>77</b>A and <b>77</b>B and the sensor array <b>78</b>A and <b>78</b>B and the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>is smaller than the distance between the X-ray head <b>10</b> and the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>. That is, since the X-ray source and the sensor array are located close to the patient <b>5</b>, the image quality of the diagnostic image is improved. In addition, it is possible to secure a wide movable range of the X-ray head <b>10</b> on the O-type gantry <b>69</b>. It is preferable that the angle between the perpendicular line that passes the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>from the center part of the sensor array <b>78</b>A surface and the perpendicular line that passes the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>from the center part of the sensor array <b>78</b>B surface is between 20 degrees and 90 degrees, and more preferably, between 40 degrees and 60 degrees. This is determined on the basis of the condition in which the X-ray head <b>10</b>, the X-ray source <b>77</b>A and the X-ray source <b>77</b>B correctly operate without affecting one another and diagnostic images with sufficient accuracy are obtained.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The output side of the X-ray generation control apparatus of the real-time imager <b>74</b> is connected with the power supply and anodes, cathodes, and grid electrodes of the X-ray sources <b>77</b>A and <b>77</b>B. When an X-ray generation command signal is outputted from the system control unit <b>80</b> to the X-ray generation control apparatus, the X-ray generation control apparatus supplies the power supply to an electron gun driving circuit. In response to this, electron beams are emitted from the cathodes of the X-ray sources <b>77</b>A and <b>77</b>B, and a negative bias voltage applied to the grid electrodes is released to a zero potential. Thus, the electron beam passes the holes of the grid electrode and is supplied to the anode. When the electron beam reaches the anode, secondary X-rays are generated from the anode and fan-shaped diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is irradiated towards the patient <b>4</b> via a collimator mounted to a window.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The transmission X-ray detected by the sensor arrays <b>78</b>A and <b>78</b>B are converted into current signals proportional to the transmitted X-ray dosage, and the current signals are sent to an image signal digitizer and a data recorder via a pre-amplifier and a main amplifier, and recorded as diagnostic image data. The photographing, data recording, and other processes of using the diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>are controlled by the system control unit <b>80</b>. The recorded diagnostic image data is outputted from the data recorder to the image processing unit <b>31</b> to be described later, and is subject to data processing by the image processing unit <b>31</b>. The processed data is reproduced and displayed on a display unit of the system control unit <b>80</b> as a diagnostic image of the diseased part <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">Through the above-mentioned 3-axis drives (I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>), an isocentric motion of the X-ray head <b>10</b> on the 8/9 spherical shell with the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>as a center becomes possible and the X-ray head <b>10</b> is directed to the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>. Further, through the above-mentioned 2-axis drives (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>), a pseudo-nonisocentric motion of the X-ray head <b>10</b> on the 8/9 spherical shell becomes possible and the X-ray head <b>10</b> is directed to a desired point in a 3-dimensional region <b>5</b> <i>b </i>in the surrounding vicinity of the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This pseudo-nonisocentric motion is a swing movement around the inertia center of the X-ray head <b>10</b>. Therefore, a markedly quick motion can be carried out, as compared to the isocentric motion. By the pseudo-nonisocentric high-responsive quick tracking motion, for example, it is possible to make the head sights to track quick movements such as heart pulses with a high speed response and precisely.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">The microwave generating unit <b>20</b> includes a klystron (not shown) and generates microwaves by a klystron system. The microwave generating unit <b>20</b> has a circulator <b>21</b> and a dummy load <b>22</b> related to the waveguide, and supplies electron acceleration microwaves to the X-ray head <b>10</b> via the waveguide tube system <b>61</b>. Here, C-band (5.6 GHz) microwaves are supplied. The microwave generating unit <b>20</b> is controlled by the system control unit <b>80</b>. The waveguide tube system <b>61</b> is a waveguide to supply the microwave generated by the microwave generating unit <b>20</b> to the X-ray head <b>10</b>. The waveguide tube system couples a link arm <b>62</b>-<b>1</b>, an articulation <b>64</b> <i>a</i>, a link arm <b>62</b>-<b>2</b>, an articulation <b>64</b> <i>b</i>, a link arm <b>63</b>, an articulation <b>64</b> <i>c</i>, a link arm <b>65</b>, an articulation <b>66</b>, and the X-ray head <b>10</b> to one another to form a link mechanism. The articulation <b>64</b> <i>a </i>can rotate around an axis in the first rotating axis J<b>1</b> direction, and the articulations <b>64</b> <i>b </i>and <b>64</b> <i>c </i>and the articulation <b>66</b> can rotate around an axis in the second rotating axis J<b>2</b> direction. By the way, the X-ray head <b>10</b> at the link head slides along the O-type gantry <b>69</b> with the motion of the O-type drive ring <b>71</b>-<b>1</b> and is swung around the articulation <b>66</b> by the first swing mechanism <b>131</b>. The articulations <b>64</b> <i>a</i>, <b>64</b> <i>b</i>, <b>64</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>66</b> include a rotary RF coupler <b>50</b> to be described later, which transfers microwaves through axial rotation.

The microwaves generated by the microwave generating unit <b>20</b> are supplied to the X-ray head <b>10</b> via the articulation <b>64</b> <i>a</i>—the link arm <b>62</b>—the articulation <b>64</b> <i>b</i>—the link arm <b>63</b>—the articulation <b>64</b> <i>c</i>—the link arm <b>65</b>- and the articulation <b>66</b>.</p>

    <p num="p-0081">The X-ray head <b>10</b> will be described in detail below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a diagram showing the configuration of the X-ray head applied to the radiotherapy apparatus according to the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a cross sectional view along the line AA in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> is a cross sectional view along the line BB in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">The X-ray head <b>10</b> has a small-size electron lineac which generates the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>in an energy range of 4 MeV to 10 MeV. The X-ray head <b>10</b> is movably supported to the O-type gantry <b>69</b> via a support frame <b>102</b>. At the same time, the X-ray head <b>10</b> is swingably coupled to the articulation <b>66</b> (rotary RF coupler) of the waveguide tube system <b>61</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">The X-ray head <b>10</b> has a main body section of the X-ray head <b>10</b> covered with a head cover <b>101</b> and is provided with a radiating section <b>120</b> for emitting radiation to the tip section of the main body section. In the head cover <b>101</b> that covers the head main body, an electric circuit/cooling water circuit <b>116</b>, an accelerator tube <b>110</b>, a RF window <b>52</b>, a waveguide tube <b>51</b>, part of a rotary RF coupler <b>50</b>B, an exhaust pipe <b>107</b>, an ion pump <b>112</b>, a target exhaust chamber <b>119</b>, a target <b>121</b>, and a cooling plate <b>122</b> are provided.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">A cable (not shown) connected to the external power supply (not shown) is introduced from an insulation glass <b>103</b> at the tail end of the accelerator tube <b>110</b> into the head cover <b>101</b>, and is connected to a cathode <b>105</b> of an electron gun <b>104</b>. An anode <b>106</b> is disposed face to face with this cathode <b>105</b>. The power supply of the electron gun <b>104</b> is controlled by the system control unit <b>80</b>. Gas between the cathode <b>105</b> and the anode <b>106</b> is discharged by an exhaust pipe <b>107</b> for communication of the ion pump <b>112</b>. The space from which gas is discharged is connected from the electron gun <b>104</b> to the accelerator tube <b>110</b>, and further from the accelerator tube <b>110</b> to the radiating section <b>120</b>. Because the ion pump <b>112</b> is directly connected to the acceleration pipe <b>110</b>, the vacuum of the accelerator tube <b>110</b> can be kept constantly at a high vacuum, and can stably accelerate the electron beams. Thus, the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>can be stably outputted. The distance from the insulation glass <b>103</b> to the tip section of the accelerator tube <b>110</b> is about 360 mm. This size is smaller to about ⅓ that of a conventionally used accelerator tube. At the same time, the weight is reduced, too. This is accomplished by using high frequency (high energy) microwaves of C band (5.6 GHz) in place of the conventionally used S band microwaves.</p>
    <p num="p-0085"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged view of the vicinity of the electron gun <b>104</b> and the accelerator tube <b>110</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. The center hole of the anode <b>106</b> of the electron gun <b>104</b> communicates with a buncher cavity <b>109</b> of the accelerator tube <b>110</b>. Inside of the accelerator tube <b>110</b>, multiple accelerator cavities <b>111</b> <i>b </i>are connected and each of them has a center hole for an electron beam passage. The accelerator tube <b>110</b> allows the electron beam radiated from the electron gun <b>104</b> to accelerates the electron beam by microwave while passing the buncher cavity <b>109</b> and center holes <b>111</b> <i>c </i>of the multiple accelerator cavities <b>111</b> <i>b</i>. The accelerated electron beam collides against the X-ray target <b>121</b> as a high-energy electron beam. The accelerator cavities <b>111</b> <i>b </i>communicate with a pair of right and left lateral exhaust pipes <b>108</b> via side couple cavities <b>111</b> <i>a</i>, respectively. A pair of right and left lateral exhaust pipes <b>108</b> are connected to the ion pump <b>112</b> via the exhaust pipe <b>107</b> and the space in the multiple accelerator cavities <b>111</b> <i>b </i>are under a vacuum.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>, the waveguide tube <b>51</b> communicates with the accelerator tube <b>110</b>. The waveguide tube <b>51</b> communicates with the microwave generating unit <b>20</b> via a ceramic RF window <b>52</b> and rotary RF couplers <b>50</b>A and <b>50</b>B (through the waveguide tube system <b>61</b>). The RF window <b>52</b> is an inlet to introduce microwave to the accelerator tube <b>110</b> and prevents SF<sub>6 </sub>gas sealed in the waveguide tube <b>51</b> from leaking. The radiating section <b>120</b> is provided to the tip section of the main body section of the X-ray head <b>10</b> covered with the head cover <b>101</b>. The radiating section is provided with the target <b>121</b>, a target cooling plate <b>122</b>, a primary collimator <b>123</b>, and a flattening filter <b>124</b>. The components from the electron gun <b>104</b> to the flattening filter <b>124</b> via the accelerator tube <b>110</b> are aligned in series along the axis of the electron beam. Thus, the accelerated electron beam passes the target exhaust chamber <b>119</b> and strikes the target <b>121</b> of the radiating section <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">The target <b>121</b> radiates braking radiation X-rays by the incidence of high-energy accelerated electrons. The target cooling plate <b>122</b> is mounted to the target, to prevent the target from being subject to heat damage by the heat generated when braking radiation X-rays are emitted. For the target <b>121</b>, a high-melting point metal such as tungsten and tantalum or their alloy is used. The primary collimator <b>123</b> is made of material such as tungsten with superior shielding capability to radiation and fewer thermal neutrons. The primary collimator reduces the X-rays from the target <b>121</b> to a specified beam width and guides to the flattening filter <b>124</b>. The flattening filter <b>124</b> averages the intensity of X-rays emitted from the target <b>121</b> and produces the therapeutic X-rays <b>3</b> <i>a </i>with a uniform dose distribution.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">Furthermore, a second collimator <b>125</b> and an ionization chamber <b>126</b> for dose measurement are mounted to the tip section of the radiating section <b>120</b>. The secondary collimator <b>125</b> is made of material such as tungsten with high shielding property and prevents the therapeutic X-rays <b>3</b> <i>a </i>from transmitting. The secondary collimator <b>125</b> guides the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>from the flattening filter <b>124</b> to the ionization chamber <b>126</b>. This secondary collimator <b>125</b> is removably attached to the end face section of the primary collimator <b>123</b>. The ionization chamber <b>126</b> measures the dose of passing X-rays. The ionization chamber is mounted to the tip section of the secondary collimator <b>125</b> and gas of the specified composition is sealed. A detecting circuit (not shown) is connected to detect discharged electric charges. This detecting circuit is connected to the input side of the system control unit <b>80</b>. The system control unit <b>80</b> calculates the dose of the X-rays emitted from the X-ray head <b>10</b> based on an input signal from the dose measurement ionization chamber <b>126</b>, and stores it in a memory as the therapeutic dose data which the patient <b>4</b> receives.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">In the radiotherapy apparatus <b>6</b> according to the present invention, the X-ray head <b>10</b> can generate the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>with high electron energy of 4 MeV to 10 MeV though the X-ray head <b>10</b> is as small as 500–600 mm in total length, 500 mm wide, 300 mm deep and 60–80 kg by weight. This is because the acceleration tube <b>110</b> is compact and light weight since high-frequency (high energy) C band (5.6 GHz) microwaves are used, a deflection magnet that deflects the electron beam and its related devices are not required since the accelerator tube <b>110</b> is small, and a device for generating microwaves (microwave generating unit <b>20</b>) is located outside the X-ray head <b>10</b>. That is, because the overall weight is reduced and the overall size is reduced, the X-ray head <b>10</b> can be moved agilely and quickly to a desired position. Also, when an accelerator tube is used which can accelerate electrons by the use of still higher-frequency X-band microwaves, the radiotherapy apparatus can be further downsized and can have its weight reduced. In such a case, the design of each unit is changed in accordance with the microwave frequency, for example, the sizes of the waveguide tube system <b>61</b>, and the accelerator cavities <b>111</b> <i>b </i>of the accelerator tube <b>110</b> are changed.</p>

    <p num="p-0097">Next, description will be made on the control system of the radiotherapy apparatus according to the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram showing the control system of a radiotherapy apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention. The control system according to this embodiment includes the therapeutic bed system <b>7</b>, an X-ray head system <b>8</b>, the real-time imager <b>74</b>, an image processing unit <b>31</b>, the microwave generating unit <b>20</b>, the system control unit <b>80</b>, and a system utility <b>90</b>. Practically, a system configuration in which the system control unit <b>80</b> administers and controls the whole is adopted.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">The system control unit <b>80</b> is provided with a system control computer, and includes a system control algorithm, image tracking algorithm, radiotherapy plan algorithm, radiotherapy control algorithm, graphical user interface (GUI) and interlock algorithm as computer programs, and a radiotherapy plan database, a trend record database, and a radiotherapy database are provided. In addition, the system controller includes a system monitor (display unit) I/O units, and BIT, and with these at the center, other system blocks are connected, respectively, and I/O signals are exchanged.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">The radiotherapy plan database stores the radiotherapy plan data as the data concerning the radiotherapy plan which a doctor designs. The radiotherapy plan data is based on various inspections carried out before an operation. The radiotherapy plan data correlates the patient attribute data, patient image data, absorbed dose data, the therapeutic dose data, and diseased part position data with each other. However, the patient attribute data indicates data of the patient <b>4</b> such as name and birthday. The patient image data indicates the X-ray tomography pictures of the patient <b>4</b>. The absorbed dose data relates to the absorbed dose of radiation (X-rays) to the diseased part <b>5</b> and the irradiation method (frequency, absorbed dose for one time, irradiation direction (route)). The therapeutic dose data relates to the therapeutic dose setting that indicates the radiation for the diseased part <b>5</b> (X-ray), the irradiation method (frequency, absorbed dose for one time, irradiation direction (route)). The diseased part position data relates to the position of the diseased part <b>5</b>. The position of the affected-portion <b>5</b> may be in the defined region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> to be described later.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">The trend record database stores irradiation resultant data concerning the actual performance of radiotherapy. The irradiation resultant data relates to radiation (X-rays) actually irradiated at the time of radiotherapy. The irradiation resultant data correlates the patient attribute data, integrated therapeutic dose, integrated dosage, the therapeutic dose for each irradiation direction (portal number), estimated dosage, target coordinates (coordinates of irradiation target in diseased part <b>5</b>), and machine coordinates (coordinates of radiation field <b>5</b>′ actually irradiated) with each other. The radiotherapy database stores the kind of substances and radiation dosage curve to indicate the relationship between the thickness of substances and radiation (X-ray) dosage, and others by correlating them with each other.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">The system control algorithm controls the whole system control unit <b>80</b> such as each algorithm, GUI, system monitor (display unit), I/O units, and BIT. The radiotherapy plan algorithm calculates the therapeutic dose data (the therapeutic dose of X-rays per each irradiation direction (route) and integrated therapeutic dose), based on the radiotherapy database (X-ray tomography images of the patient <b>4</b>, dosage data) and the radiotherapy database (radiation dosage curve for each substance). The results are displayed on the display unit and are verified by the doctor or physician. The doctor or physician varies the irradiation directions and X-ray dosage to obtain the desired the therapeutic dose data. After the verification, the results are stored in the radiotherapy plan database.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">The radiotherapy control algorithm controls an X-ray head system <b>8</b> so that the X-ray head <b>10</b> is directed to the specified direction in accordance with the radiotherapy plan data of the radiotherapy plan database and/or X-ray head <b>10</b> swing rate from the image tracking algorithm. Also, the radiotherapy control algorithm stores the irradiation resultant data obtained from image processing unit <b>31</b>, the X-ray head system <b>8</b>, and the image tracking algorithm during the radiotherapy in the trend record database.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">The image tracking algorithm calculates the coordinates of the diseased part <b>5</b> in accordance with the tracking image data obtained from the image processing unit <b>31</b>. Also, based on various data obtained from the X-ray head system <b>8</b>, the coordinates of the radiation field <b>5</b>′ of the X-ray head <b>10</b> are found. Based on the coordinates of the diseased part <b>5</b> and coordinates of radiation field <b>5</b>′, swing of the X-ray head <b>10</b> is calculated.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">The interlock algorithm allows the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>and the diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>to make an emergency stop when specified conditions are satisfied. The specified conditions include a case that the emergency stop button is pressed, a case that the radiation field <b>5</b>′ and the diseased part <b>5</b> are separated by more than the preset distance, and at least one of a case in which the therapeutic dose and dosage to the patient <b>4</b> exceeds the relevant present allowable value, a case in which the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is stopped to irradiate the diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, and a case in which the diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is stopped to irradiate the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0105">The X-ray transmission data detected by the real-time imager <b>74</b> is reconstructed to a diagnostic image by the image restructuring algorithm in the image processing unit <b>31</b>, and transmitted to the system control unit <b>80</b>. By this, the diagnosis image is formed in real time during the radiotherapy, and the doctor or physician is able to carry out the radiotherapy while watching the diagnostic images displayed on the compute display unit of the system control unit <b>80</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">The microwave generating unit <b>20</b> includes a Klystron modulator and lineac system controller, Klystron, and RF driver. Klystron is connected to the X-ray head <b>10</b> via the waveguide tube system <b>61</b>, and is the supply source to supply the microwave to the accelerator tube <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">The X-ray head system <b>8</b> includes the X-ray head <b>10</b>, isocentric drive mechanism (including the O-type gantry <b>69</b>, the ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b>, and the gantry rotating mechanism <b>72</b>), and a swing drive mechanism (including the first swing mechanism <b>131</b>, the second swing mechanism <b>132</b>, and the rotary RF coupler <b>50</b>). The isocentric drive mechanism and the swing drive mechanism are connected to the system control unit <b>80</b> via each driver (isocentric driver and swing driver), and the isocentric drive mechanism of the X-ray head <b>10</b> during the isocentric irradiation and 2-axis swing drive mechanism of the X-ray head <b>10</b> at the time of pseudo-isocentric irradiation are controlled.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">Next, the operation of the radiotherapy apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">First of all, the position is calibrated. The position is calibrated by the use of a CCD camera <b>60</b> installed to allow the center of the light receiving surface to overlap the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and to keep the light receiving surface horizontal, and a laser transmitter installed in the X-ray head <b>10</b> to imitate the electron lineac. The deviation between the laser light receiving point and the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>is designated as a compensation value.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">Through the above-mentioned position calibration method, the positional deviation by strain at the time of fabrication, deflection by dead weight, displacement by stress at the time of installation can be corrected highly accurately in large machined workpieces such as the O-type gantry <b>69</b> in a short time, and the positional accuracy can be improved. In the present embodiment, it becomes possible to achieve about 20-μm positional resolution. This kind of position calibration is carried out when the radiotherapy apparatus <b>6</b> is installed and during periodical inspection. However, the position may be calibrated for each designated use frequency and each radiotherapy.</p>

    <p num="p-0126">Referring now to the drawings, how to irradiate the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>to the subject while the X-ray head <b>10</b> is being swung will be described.</p>
    <p num="p-0127"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a perspective view showing the manner of radiotherapy by the X-ray head <b>10</b>.

    <p num="p-0128">In order to irradiate the X-rays while tracking the movement of the radiation field <b>5</b>′, in the period from time t<b>3</b> to t<b>4</b>, the system control unit <b>80</b> calculates shift quantities DV<b>1</b> and DV<b>2</b> of the diseased part <b>5</b> from the radiation field <b>5</b>′ in the X-axis direction and Y-axis direction based on the calculated position of the diseased part <b>5</b> (coordinate (X, Y, Z)) and the present coordinate (x, y, z) of the radiation field <b>5</b>′ of the X-ray head <b>10</b>. Then, displacement angles θ<b>1</b> and θ<b>2</b> through the movement around the first swing drive axis S<b>1</b> and the second swing drive axis S<b>2</b> are calculated based on the shift quantities DV<b>1</b> and DV<b>2</b>, using a specified calculation equation.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">In the above-mentioned time period from time t<b>5</b> to time t<b>6</b>, the X-ray head <b>10</b> is swung around the first swing drive axis S<b>1</b> by displacement angle θ<b>1</b> and around the second swing drive axis S<b>2</b> by displacement angle θ<b>2</b>. Then, as soon as the swing operation is stopped, the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is emitted from the X-ray head <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">Through the above steps S<b>2</b>-<b>1</b> to S<b>2</b>-<b>6</b>, sights of the X-ray head <b>10</b> tracks the diseased part <b>5</b> quickly and at a high precision response even if the diseased part <b>5</b> is below the neck, and such as a tumor under the influence of movements and state of organs such as breathing, heart pulses, vermiculation, and urine volume in a bladder. Thus, it is possible to irradiate radiation (X-ray) to the diseased part at high accuracy. That is, within 0.03 second including the processing time of the diagnostic images, the X-ray head <b>10</b> can be swung and irradiate radiation (X-ray) to the diseased part. Thus, the X-ray head <b>10</b> can quickly follow the movement of the radiation field (diseased part).</p>
    <p num="p-0131">In the above process, the angle of the swing operation of the X-ray head <b>10</b> in the step S<b>2</b>-<b>5</b> is limited to a predetermined range during the period from time t<b>3</b> to time t<b>4</b> in the step S<b>2</b>-<b>4</b>. This is because as the swing angle increases, the time for the swing operation increases, so that the diseased part <b>5</b> moves further. As a result, the coordinate point (x, y, z) of the radiation field <b>5</b>′ of the X-ray head <b>10</b> would greatly deviate from the position of the coordinate point (X, Y, Z) of the diseased part <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">The quick movement of the diseased part <b>5</b> followed by the X-ray head <b>10</b> is mainly through breathing and heart pulses. In such a case, the diseased part <b>5</b> generally moves in the same region (however, the route is not always same).</p>
    <p num="p-0133">Consequently, even if the coordinate point (x, y, z) of the radiation field <b>5</b>′ of the X-ray head <b>10</b> does not completely coincide with the coordinate point (X, Y, Z) of the diseased part <b>5</b>, it is possible to bring them in line thereafter.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">When any trouble occurs in the acquisition of the diagnostic image data or image tracking calculation, the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is interlocked to stop irradiation at that point of time, and safety is secured. The therapy apparatus of the present invention is designed to carry out irradiation of the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>after it is confirmed that the swing operation and the positioning operation of the X-ray head <b>10</b> are properly carried out.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">When the deviation of the coordinate point (x, y, z) of the radiation field <b>5</b>′ from the coordinate point (X, Y, Z) of the diseased part <b>5</b> is greater than a preset value, irradiation of the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>in Step S<b>2</b>-<b>6</b> (time t<b>5</b> to t<b>6</b>) is not carried out.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">Also, the system control unit <b>80</b> can move the ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b>, the gantry rotating mechanism <b>72</b>, and the therapeutic bed system <b>7</b> as required, such that the sight of the X-ray head <b>10</b> can be aligned to the diseased part <b>5</b>. That is, the system control unit <b>80</b> calculates the swing quantities (for first swing mechanism <b>131</b> and the second swing mechanism <b>132</b>) and the movement quantity (for the ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b>, gantry rotating mechanism <b>73</b>, and the therapeutic bed system <b>7</b>) of the X-ray head <b>10</b> in the period from time t<b>3</b> to time t<b>4</b> based on the coordinate of the diseased part <b>5</b> and the coordinate of the radiation field <b>5</b>′. Next, in the period from time t<b>4</b> to time t<b>5</b>, the swing quantities and the movement quantity of the X-ray head <b>10</b> are outputted to the X-ray head system <b>8</b>. Then, the first swing mechanism <b>131</b>, the second swing mechanism <b>132</b>, the ring circumferential moving mechanism <b>70</b>, the gantry rotating mechanism <b>73</b>, and the therapeutic bed system <b>7</b> are moved to align the sight of the X-ray head <b>10</b> to the diseased part <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">After the irradiation of the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is stopped, the irradiation of diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>begins at timing t<b>5</b>, and the process advances to the next diagnostic image processing cycle from time t<b>5</b> to time t<b>8</b>. Then, at timing t<b>3</b> after the diagnostic image processing, interlock of the X-ray head <b>10</b> is cancelled and the irradiation of the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is restarted.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">In this way, the cycle of a total of 0.03 second, namely, 0.01 second for the diagnostic image processing cycle (0-Ta in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>), 0.01 second for the image tracking calculation cycle and X-ray head swing cycle (Ta to Tb in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>), and 0.01 second for the therapeutic X-ray irradiation cycle (Tb to Tc in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>) is repeated. That is, in a cycle shorter than 1/30 second (=0.033 second), the radiation head can be accurately directed to the irradiation subject. Thus, even if the diseased part (radiation field) has the quickest movement such as heart pulse, the irradiation subject can be accurately tracked in real time and radiation can be struck.</p>

    <p num="p-0154"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A to 16E</figref> are diagrams showing a relationship between the diseased part <b>5</b> and the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> and the frame <b>5</b>-<b>2</b> by pattern matching. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> indicates a relationship between the diseased part <b>5</b> and the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16B to 16E</figref> show a relationship between the diseased part <b>5</b> and the frame <b>5</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="h-0020">(1) Step S<b>4</b>-<b>1</b> </p>
    <p num="p-0155">The doctor or physician shows the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> on the display unit by a touch pen or a pointing device like a mouse on the display unit.</p>
    <p num="h-0021">(2) Step S<b>4</b>-<b>2</b> </p>
    <p num="p-0156">The radiotherapy plan algorithm extracts the diagnostic image in the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> based on the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> drawn on the display unit and the diagnostic image on the display unit. Thus, the radiotherapy plan algorithm grasps the shape, coordinate, and brightness distribution of the diagnostic image. Or, the radiotherapy plan algorithm grasps the shape, coordinate, and brightness distribution of the diagnostic image by extracting the shape of the brightness range for a predetermined ratio (for example, 90%) of the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>.</p>
    <p num="h-0022">(3) Step S<b>4</b>-<b>3</b> </p>
    <p num="p-0157">The radiotherapy plan algorithm calculates the center of gravity for the shape of the range of the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> or the shape of the brightness range which indicates the predetermined ratio. The algorithm displays the calculation result by “+” on the display unit. For example, the center of gravity of the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>) is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>. The center of gravity of the brightness range (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>) for the predetermined ratio is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</figref>. By the way, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16E</figref>, only the center of the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> may be simply shown.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">Through the above, the pattern matching is ended.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">Also, it is possible to carry out binary display in which the range of the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> or the brightness range for the predetermined ratio is displayed in a specific color and others in another color on the display unit. In this case, grasping of the brightness distribution is carried out as follows. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a graph showing one example of brightness distribution in the diagnostic image. The data is plotted in which the vertical axis shows brightness and the horizontal axis shows the position of the diagnostic image. The graph indicates that the brightness in the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> of the diagnostic image is in the range of L<b>1</b> to L<b>2</b>. Consequently, the brightness range of the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> is L<b>1</b> to L<b>2</b>. Also, the brightness range for the predetermined ratio of the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> (example: 90%) is a continuous brightness range L<b>3</b> to L<b>4</b> which is selected in such a manner as to occupy the area of the predetermined ratio (example: 90%) in the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> of the brightness range L<b>1</b> to L<b>2</b>. In such a case, L<b>2</b>=L<b>4</b>. It should be noted that since other positions that indicate the same brightness are apart from the definition region <b>5</b>-<b>1</b>, they are not recognized.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">According to the therapy apparatus of the present embodiment, the radiation irradiating head (X-ray head <b>10</b>) can be swung within 0.02 seconds including the diagnostic image processing to follow the movement of the radiation field (diseased part). Therefore, it is possible to irradiate the therapeutic X-ray to the radiation field at a high accuracy (radiation time: 0.01 second). In this way, it is possible to carry out non-isocentric irradiation at high-speed response and in high accuracy based on the movement of the diseased part. Therefore, it is possible to accept as radiotherapy subjects diseased parts below the neck, e.g., tumors under the influence of movements and conditions of the organs, such as breathing, heart pulses, vermiculation, and urine volume in a bladder.</p>
    <p num="p-0161">It is not possible to use the imaging for the soft tissues with low contrast. Therefore, the positioning of the radiation field should be carried out by using an X-ray CT, and MRI, based on landmarks with high contrast such as bone tissue. Or, small-size gold plates are embedded in the vicinity of the radiation field to use them as markers, or image enhancement is carried out by using contrast agents or through differential image processing as in a case of DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiography). Also, in the X-ray CT and PET, high-speed real-time image reconstruction calculation is carried out for real-time imaging.</p>
    <p num="p-0162">In the radiotherapy apparatus according to the present invention, even during radiation irradiation radiotherapy, it is possible to monitor the state of the radiotherapy field in real time by the real-time imager (X-ray system) which operates in linkage to the X-ray head (radiation irradiating head).</p>
    <p num="p-0163">Also, in the radiotherapy apparatus according to the present invention, the sensor array (image detector) of the real-time imager (X-ray system) is located on the X-ray head (radiation irradiating head) side and operates in linkage with the movement of the X-ray head. Consequently, it is possible to eliminate the influence of the therapeutic radiation to the sensor array.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">Also, a set of X-ray source and sensor arrays has a fixed positional relationship to the X-ray head <b>10</b>. Therefore, it is possible to greatly reduce the burdens of acquiring the diagnostic images or the burdens of the operation of the real-time imager.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">In addition, because the sensor array is mounted to the X-ray head side, the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, which is an extremely strong X-ray, is not incident on the sensor array.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">Furthermore, in the radiotherapy apparatus of the present invention, the O-type gantry is used. Consequently, the X-ray head (radiation irradiating head) can move in the extremely wide range of the 8/9 spherical shell, and is able to irradiate the radiation to the radiotherapy field from any desired angle. In addition, the O-type gantry has a stable structure and high strength. Consequently, it has few problems of apparatus deformation or inertia, and positioning of the X-ray head and sights alignment of radiation irradiation can be accurately carried out.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">Furthermore, when the radiotherapy field in the radiotherapy moves, quick sight alignment is carried out from a wide range by the gimbal ring mechanism, and it is possible to irradiate radiation to the radiotherapy field while tracking the radiotherapy field quickly.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">Also, because the radiotherapy apparatus of the present invention can accurately irradiate radiation, it is possible to reduce the radiation dose while increasing the therapeutic effects. That is, it is possible to alleviate burdens to the patient.</p>

    <p num="p-0177">The real-time imager <b>30</b> irradiates the diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>to the therapeutic field of the patient <b>4</b> and the diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is a weak fan beam X-ray from the two directions (X-ray sources <b>37</b>A, <b>37</b>B).

    <p num="p-0209">The configuration of the present embodiment is same as the third embodiment except for the real-time imager <b>30</b>′. This real-time imager <b>30</b>′ includes a rotation drive mechanism <b>39</b>, holding frames <b>35</b>A′, <b>35</b>B′, holding frames <b>36</b>A′, <b>36</b>B′, and a set of 2 sets of X-ray sources <b>37</b>A′ and <b>37</b>B′ and the sensor arrays <b>38</b>A′ and <b>38</b>B′, which are usual x-ray cameras.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">The holding frames <b>35</b>A′ and <b>35</b>B′ have their one ends connected to X-ray sources <b>37</b>A′ and <b>37</b>B′ and the other ends to the rotation drive mechanism <b>39</b>. Similarly, the holding frames <b>36</b>A′, <b>36</b>B′ have one ends connected to sensor arrays <b>38</b>A′, <b>38</b>B′ and the other ends to the rotation drive mechanism <b>39</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0211">The sensor array <b>38</b>A′ is located in the vicinity of one side of the X-ray head <b>10</b> in the Y-axis direction.

It should be noted that the two sets of X-ray sources <b>37</b>A′ and <b>37</b>B′ and the sensor arrays <b>38</b>A′ and <b>38</b>B′ may be controlled independently, respectively, if their visual lines of the sets of X-ray source and sensor array do not coincide.</p>
    <p num="p-0214">Because other configurations and operations of the real-time imager <b>30</b>′ are same as the real-time imager <b>30</b>, the details will be omitted.

    <p num="p-0215">Also, since the set of X-ray sources and sensor arrays are mounted to a mechanism different from the X-ray head, the burden on the gantry and X-ray head are small.</p>
    <heading>Fifth Embodiment</heading> <p num="p-0216">Referring now to the attached drawings, a fifth embodiment of the radiotherapy apparatus according to the present invention will be described in detail. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a perspective view showing the configuration of the radiotherapy apparatus according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention.

The coordinate <b>200</b> shows the three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates which have X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0217">The radiotherapy apparatus <b>6</b>E includes the therapeutic bed system <b>7</b>, the X-ray head <b>10</b>, the support frame <b>102</b>, the Ω-type gantry <b>9</b>, the waveguide tube system <b>11</b> (not shown), the microwave generating unit <b>20</b> (not shown), the support bed <b>29</b>, and the real-time imager.</p>
    <p num="p-0218">The configuration of the present embodiment is same as the third embodiment except that the real-time imager differs.</p>
    <p num="p-0219">The Ω-type gantry <b>9</b> includes the gantry tilting mechanism <b>28</b>, the head circumferential moving mechanism <b>33</b>, and the wiring <b>32</b>. The gantry tilting mechanism <b>28</b> tiltably supports the Ω-type gantry <b>9</b>. The gantry tilting mechanism <b>28</b> can tilt the Q-type gantry <b>9</b> as shown by G<b>1</b>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> around the gantry tilting axis <b>26</b> in a range from 0 degrees to 90 degrees (position tilted in the Z-axis negative direction and then tilted further to the X-axis positive direction), by setting the upright position in the Z-axis positive direction to 0 degrees. That is, the Ω-type gantry <b>9</b> moves as if it draws a ¼ sphere (¼ spherical shell) with the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>set as a center. The Ω-type gantry <b>9</b> is made of material with large rigidity, for example, stainless steel, and is 200–400 mm wide, 20–50 mm thick, and 800–1000 mm in radius from the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0220">The head circumferential moving mechanism <b>33</b> and the wiring <b>32</b> are same as those of the fourth embodiment and the description will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="p-0221">By the above-mentioned 3-axis drives (G<b>1</b>′, H<b>1</b>), the X-ray head <b>10</b> can perform isocentric motion (the X-ray head <b>10</b> is directed to the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>) on the ¼ spherical shell with the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>as a center. Furthermore, by the above-mentioned 2-axis drives (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>), the X-ray head <b>10</b> can perform pseudo-nonisocentric motion on the ¾ spherical shell (X-ray head <b>10</b> is directed to a desired point in the three dimensional region <b>5</b> <i>b </i>(see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) in the surrounding vicinity of the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>). Because this pseudo-nonisocentric motion is a swing operation around the inertia center of the X-ray head <b>10</b>, motion is markedly quick, as compared to the isocentric motion. Through the pseudo-nonisocentric high-responsive quick tracking motion, it is possible to allow the head sights to track at a high response and precisely even for the quick motion such as heart pulses.</p>
    <p num="p-0222">The real-time imager includes rotation drive mechanisms <b>39</b>A″-<b>1</b>, <b>39</b>A″-<b>2</b>, <b>39</b>B″-<b>1</b> and <b>39</b>B″-<b>2</b>, X-ray source <b>37</b>A″-<b>1</b> and <b>37</b>A″-<b>2</b> and <b>37</b>B″-<b>1</b> and <b>37</b>B″-<b>2</b> which are mounted to each of the rotation drive mechanisms, respectively, holding frames <b>36</b>A″ and <b>36</b>B″, and sensor arrays <b>38</b>″ and <b>38</b>B″.</p>

That is, the holding frames <b>36</b>A″ and <b>36</b>B″ are fixed to the X-ray head <b>10</b> and can move in conjunction with the X-ray head <b>10</b>. The angle made by the sensor array <b>38</b>A″ or sensor array <b>38</b>B″ and the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and X-ray head <b>10</b> are between 90 degrees and 20 degrees and more preferably, between 60 degrees and 30 degrees.</p>
    <p num="p-0224">The sensor array <b>38</b>A″ is located in the vicinity of one side of the X-ray head <b>10</b> in the Y-axis direction. The perpendicular line from the center portion of the sensor plane is directed to the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>. Similarly, the sensor array <b>38</b>B″ is mounted in the vicinity of the other side in the Y-axis direction of the X-ray head <b>10</b>.

    <p num="p-0226">Each of X-ray sources <b>37</b>A″-<b>1</b>, <b>37</b>A″-<b>2</b>, <b>37</b>B″-<b>1</b> and <b>37</b>B″-<b>2</b> are mounted on the rotation drive mechanisms <b>39</b>A″-<b>1</b>, <b>39</b>A″-<b>2</b>, <b>39</b>B″-<b>1</b> and <b>39</b>B″-<b>2</b>. By the system control unit <b>80</b>, the optimum two X-ray sources are selected from the plurality of X-ray sources based on the position of the X-ray head <b>10</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, four of X-ray sources <b>37</b>A″-<b>1</b>, <b>37</b>A″-<b>2</b>, <b>37</b>B″-<b>1</b> and <b>37</b>B″-<b>2</b>). In this case, the optimum two X-ray sources are designed to satisfy the conditions that the diagnostic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is irradiated to the peripheral region (vicinity of the isocenter <b>5</b> <i>a</i>) including the diseased part <b>5</b> and the transmission X-ray reaches sensor arrays. This selection of the optimum X-ray sources is carried out every time the portal (irradiation direction) of the therapeutic X-ray <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is changed (this is not carried out in the tracking motion). Also, the two sets of selected X-ray sources and sensor arrays are controlled to prevent their visual lines from coinciding.</p>
    <p num="p-0227">Because other configurations and operations of the real-time imager are the same as the real-time imager <b>30</b>, the details will be omitted. Also, because the configuration and operation of the present embodiment is the same as that of the third embodiment except for the real-time imager, the details will be omitted for other configurations.</p>
    <p num="p-0228">According to the radiotherapy apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to obtain effects the same as those of the third embodiment. Also, since the set of X-ray sources and sensor arrays are mounted to a mechanism different from the X-ray head, the burdens on the gantry and X-ray head are small.</p>
    <p num="p-0229">According to the present invention, pseudo-nonisocentric radiotherapy is made possible by allowing the head section itself to carry out 1-axis or 2-axis swing operation around an appropriate rotation center such as its inertia center in addition to the isocentric motion of the whole radiation head. Also, the same effect can be achieved, compared with completely nonisocentric radiotherapy apparatus. Also, the X-ray head can follow the movement of the radiation field caused by breathing or heart pulses at high speed.</p>
    <p num="p-0230">According to the present invention, the nonmagnetic type precision inspection apparatus enables high-accuracy control of conditions of radiation irradiating position, irradiation time, and others while the radiotherapy field is being confirmed. Consequently, the apparatus can not only be applied to the head which has no movement in the organ itself but also accurately irradiate the X-ray to small seats of disease of organs with movements such as heart and lungs, and the application can be increased in the radiotherapy field.</p>
    <p num="p-0231">According to the present invention, unlike a cantilever type robot arm which causes many problems from the viewpoint of rigidity, a high-strength high-rigidity radiation head support structure can be adopted, and high absolute accuracy can be mechanically guaranteed. Consequently, the desired efficient therapy is made possible.</p>
    <p num="p-0232">It is a problem from the viewpoint of patient safety to apply a general-purpose industrial robot arm which has an excessive degree of freedom that exceeds the degree of freedom required for nonisocentric radiotherapy. That is, in the event of accidents such as an erroneous operation of the robot arm, the robot arm or the radiation irradiating head at its tip section may come in contact with a patient, possibly causing traumatic danger to the patient. On contrary, the radiotherapy apparatus of the present invention has the movable range restricted and can secure absolute safety to the patient.</p>
    <p num="p-0233">In the conventional technique, the radiation field cannot be monitored in real time during radiotherapy, and irradiation based on estimation is forced to be carried out. However, according to the present invention, it becomes possible to monitor the radiation field in real time during radiotherapy by an imager such as usual X-ray cameras, X-ray CT, PET, and DSA, and high reliability and high safety radiotherapy is achieved.</p>
    <p num="p-0234">In addition, the image tracking operation is carried out on the basis of the radiation field images obtained in real time and follow-up irradiation to moving radiation fields is made possible.</p>
    <p num="p-0235">By the man-machine interface with a doctor or physician shown in embodiments of the present invention, radiotherapy with superb safety and reliability is achieved.</p>
    <p num="p-0236">In the radiotherapy apparatus of the present invention, it becomes possible to monitor the radiation field condition in real time without interfering with the X-ray head (radiation irradiating head) by the real-time imager (X-ray system) which operates in linkage with the X-ray head (radiation irradiating head) even while radiotherapy is being carried out by irradiating the seat of disease with radiation.</p>
