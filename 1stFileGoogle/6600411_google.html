    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>This invention generally relates to an electrical connector cord. More specifically, the present invention relates to a simplified bicycle electrical connector cord, which connects three electrical bicycle devices in an unobtrusive manner.</p>
    <p>2. Background Information</p>
    <p>Bicycling is becoming an increasingly more popular form of recreation as well as a means of transportation. Moreover, bicycling has also become a very popular competitive sport for both amateurs and professionals. Whether the bicycle is used for recreation, transportation or competition, the bicycle industry is constantly improving the various components of the bicycle. Specifically, manufacturers of bicycle components have been continually improving performance, reliability and appearance of the various components.</p>
    <p>Recently, bicycles have been provided with electronically controlled components. These electronic components include a rear multi-stage sprocket assembly with a motorized rear derailleur and a front multi-stage sprocket assembly with a motorized front derailleur. Additionally, many bicycles include suspension assemblies for off-road type riding. These suspension assemblies can also be electronically controlled. Many bicycles utilize a cycle computer with one or more sensors to monitor various operations of the bicycle, such as speed, cadence, riding time and gear position.</p>
    <p>The cycle computer is also often coupled to other components that are electrically controlled or operated, such as the front derailleur, rear derailleur or suspension assemblies. In this type of an arrangement, electrical wires or cords are utilized to transmit the electrical current to and from the various components and sensors. These electrical wires or cords are often connected to the components and/or sensors by electrical connectors. These electrical wires and connectors are often attached to the bicycle frame without regard to the appearance of the bicycle.</p>
    <p>Since the bicycle is typically utilized outdoors, the electrical connections of the electrical connectors are exposed to a variety of weather conditions. The electrical connections can often be contaminated so as to degrade performance of the operation of the electrically control component. If the electrical connections get too dirty, the bicycle components and/or sensors may not operate properly. Since the electrical connections are exposed to adverse weather conditions, it is important that the electrical connectors provide a good solid connection so that they can operate even though they may become slightly contaminated.</p>
    <p>Additionally, in certain riding conditions such as off-road type riding, the cyclist often encounters obstructions such as bushes or tree limbs. Sometimes, these obstructions can catch the electrical wires or cords and affect performance of the electrical components and/or sensors. Additionally, in some situations, other obstructions such as clothing, bicycle lock cables or tools can catch on the electrical wires or cords. Furthermore, since these wires or cords and connectors are often attached to the bicycle without regard to their appearance, the bicycle can have an unattractive look.</p>
    <p>In view of the above, there exists a need for an electrical connector cord which overcomes the above mentioned problems in the prior art. This invention addresses this need in the prior art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>One object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector cord with a simplified structure.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector cord that provides improved durability and waterproofing.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector cord, which is relatively simple and inexpensive to manufacture and assemble.</p>
    <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector cord, which contributes to a clean, attractive appearance for the bicycle.</p>
    <p>The foregoing objects can basically be attained by providing bicycle electrical connector cord comprising a first electrical connector, a primary cable, a second electrical connector, a secondary cable and an electrical device. The first electrical connector has a first connector body with a plurality of first electrical contacts. The primary cable includes a first electrical conducting member electrically coupled to one of the first electrical contacts and a second electrical conducting member electrically coupled to one of the first electrical contacts. The second electrical connector has a second connector body with at least one second electrical contact electrically coupled to the first electrical conducting member. The secondary cable extends from the second electrical connector and includes a third electrical conducting member electrically coupled to the second electrical conducting member. The electrical device is electrically coupled to the third electrical conducting member.</p>
    <p>The foregoing objects can also basically be attained by providing a method of attaching a bicycle electrical connector cord to a bicycle. The method includes attaching a first electrical connector to a bicycle display unit on the bicycle with a first end of primary cable extending from the first electrical connector. The method also includes attaching a second electrical connector to a first electrical device on a non-forwardly facing portion of the bicycle with a second end of the primary cable extending from the second electrical connector. The method further includes attaching a secondary cable to a non-forwardly facing portion of the bicycle with a first end of the secondary cable being coupled to the second electrical connector. The method still further includes attaching a second electrical device to a non-forwardly facing portion of the bicycle with a second end of the secondary cable being electrically coupled to the electrical device.</p>
    <p>These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>

Opposite ends of third electrical conductors <b>62</b> are electrically coupled to sensor <b>22</b> at first electrical conductor <b>30</b>. Thus, sensor <b>22</b> is electrically coupled to computer <b>20</b> via first electrical connector <b>30</b>, primary cable <b>32</b>, second electrical connector <b>34</b> and secondary cable <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 4-14, second electrical connector <b>34</b> is a six-pin type female electrical connector, and basically includes a second connector body <b>80</b> with at least one second electrical contact electrically coupled to first electrical conducting member <b>50</b>. Second electrical connector <b>34</b> also preferably includes at least one third electrical contact electrically coupled to second electrical conducting member <b>52</b> and third electrical conducting member <b>60</b> within second connector body <b>34</b>. Preferably, a pair of terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>form the second electrical contact and are electrically coupled to individual first conductors <b>54</b> of first electrical conducting member <b>50</b> by soldering in a conventional manner. Preferably, a pair of short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>form the third electrical contact and are electrically coupled to individual second and third conductors <b>56</b> and <b>62</b> by soldering in a conventional manner. In the illustrated embodiment, second electrical connector <b>34</b> is designed to mate with a male electrical connector of front suspension fork <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>Basically, the male electrical connector of front suspension fork <b>16</b> is relatively conventional, and therefore, will not be discussed and/or illustrated in detail herein. Basically, the male electrical connector of front suspension fork <b>16</b> has a receptor housing with six (or fewer) receptor pins. The receptor pins have a circular cross-section and are arranged in a pattern to mate with second electrical connector <b>34</b>. The receptor housing preferably has an annular flange for releasably retaining the electrical connector <b>34</b> thereto via a snap-fit. The receptor housing is constructed of a non-conductive material such as a hard, rigid plastic material. The receptor pins are constructed of a conductive material. In other words, the male connector of the front suspension fork <b>16</b> is substantially identical to the male connector of the cycle computer <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>Preferably, second electrical connector <b>34</b> includes one pair of terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and one pair of short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>as seen in FIG. <b>8</b>. Short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>are electrically coupled to second electrical conducting member <b>52</b> of primary cable <b>32</b> and third electrical conducting member <b>60</b> of secondary cable <b>36</b>, as mentioned above. Specifically, individual second conductors <b>56</b> and individual third conductors <b>62</b> of second and third conducting members <b>52</b> and <b>60</b>, respectively, are electrically coupled to short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>by soldering in a conventional manner, as also mentioned above. Short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>are modified versions of terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a</i>, as discussed in more detail below. More specifically, short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>are cut off such that short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>will not make electrical contact with receptor pins of the male connector.</p>
    <p>Second connector body <b>80</b> is basically formed of a terminal housing <b>84</b>, an inner casing <b>86</b> and an outer casing <b>88</b>, as seen in FIG. <b>7</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, second electrical connector <b>34</b> is a female electrical connector or receptacle with six terminal pin receptacles. Of course, it will be apparent skilled in the art from this disclosure that second electrical connector <b>34</b> can be a male electrical connector or a plug without departing from certain aspects of the present invention. Also, in the illustrated embodiment, second electrical connector <b>34</b> includes two terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and two short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b</i>. Of course, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the number and/or type of terminal pins can be fewer or more depending upon the particular application or use of electrical connector <b>34</b>. However, in the illustrated embodiment, only the two terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>are electrically coupled to the front suspension fork <b>16</b>, as discussed below in more detail.</p>
    <p>Terminal housing <b>84</b> is preferably formed of non-conductive material and includes the plurality of terminal pin receptacles formed therein. Terminal housing <b>84</b> has a generally cylindrical shape with a pair of protrusions or detents formed adjacent the second end and a pair of annular flanges that form an annular recess therebetween. The protrusions or detents and one of the flanges form part of a snap-fit that couples the terminal housing <b>84</b> to the inner casing <b>86</b>. The detents are preferably diametrically opposed, i.e., spaced 180° apart along the outer surface of the terminal housing <b>84</b>. The other annular flange and the annular recess are designed to ensure that outer casing <b>88</b> is securely molded onto terminal housing <b>84</b>, as explained below in more detail.</p>
    <p>Terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and <b>82</b> <i>b </i>are received in the terminal pin receptacles. Terminal housing <b>84</b> is preferably constructed of a hard, rigid plastic material for housing the terminal pins <b>82</b>. Preferably terminal housing <b>84</b> is molded as a one-piece, unitary member constructed of a substantial hard, rigid non-metallic material such as nylon. The terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and <b>82</b> <i>b </i>are preferably frictionally retained or press-fitted within each one of the terminal pin receptacles of the terminal housing <b>84</b>. Terminal housing <b>84</b> is relatively conventional, and thus, will not be discussed and/or illustrated in detail herein.</p>
    <p>The terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and <b>42</b> are identical and preferably constructed of any conductive material that is normally utilized in the electrical connector art. Preferably, each of the terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and <b>42</b> is formed from a stamped sheet metal material and has a first contact end, a second connection end with a bent portion, and a cord receiving recess formed by the bent portion. The cord receiving recess is designed to receive a portion of the end of one of the electrical conductors <b>54</b> of the primary cable <b>32</b>. Preferably, the electrical conductors <b>54</b> are soldered within the cord receiving recess to form a secure connection therebetween. The bent portion also forms a stop on a second longitudinal side of the connection end portion. Terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and <b>42</b> are also relatively conventional, and thus, will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein.</p>
    <p>Short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>are modified versions of terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a</i>, as mentioned above. Specifically, short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>are identical to terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and <b>42</b>, except short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>are cut off. More specifically, each of the short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>is formed from a stamped sheet metal material and has a first cut off end, a second connection end with a bent portion, and a cord receiving recess formed by the bent portion. Each cord receiving recess is designed to receive a portion of the end of one of the electrical conductors <b>56</b> of the primary cable <b>32</b> and a portion of the end of one of the electrical conductors <b>62</b> of the secondary cable <b>36</b>. Preferably, the electrical conductors <b>56</b> and <b>62</b> are soldered within the cord receiving recess to form a secure connection therebetween. The bent portion also forms a stop on a second longitudinal side of the connection end portion.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>12</b>, inner casing <b>86</b> has a tubular side wall with the terminal housing <b>84</b> located in a first open end of the tubular side wall. The electrical conductors <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>60</b> (i.e. ends of primary and secondary cables <b>32</b> and <b>36</b>) are located in a second open end of the tubular side wall. More specifically, a C-shaped retaining member <b>81</b> (FIGS. 7, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>) holds primary cable <b>32</b> and secondary cable <b>36</b> together.</p>
    <p>The tubular side wall preferably has at least one side opening, and preferably two side openings that are diametrically opposed 180 degrees apart. These side openings are relatively large to allow the material of the outer casing <b>88</b> to freely flow into the interior of the inner casing <b>86</b>. Thus, the ends of the electrical conductors <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>60</b> are completely covered by the material of outer casing <b>88</b>. This ensures a good waterproof connection there between. Moreover, by completely encasing the electrical connections between the electrical conductors <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>60</b>, and the terminal pins <b>82</b>, the electrical connections are very durable and resistant to detachment.</p>
    <p>The tubular side wall is also preferably provided with a pair of notches, which are formed as rectangular openings. These notches form a part of a snap-fit arrangement between the terminal housing <b>84</b> and the inner casing <b>86</b>. In other words, the notches are diametrically opposed from each other, i.e., spaced 180° apart around the inner casing <b>86</b>. The inner casing <b>86</b> is constructed from a relatively rigid material with a limited amount of resiliency. In other words, due to the tubular shape of the inner casing <b>86</b>, the tubular side wall can flex radially outwardly upon the insertion of the terminal housing <b>84</b> being inserted into the first open end of the inner casing <b>86</b>. Insertion of the terminal housing <b>84</b> into the first open end <b>94</b> causes the protrusions or detents of the terminal housing <b>84</b> to engage the inner surface of the tubular side wall of the inner casing <b>86</b>. The protrusion causes the tubular side wall to flex slightly outwardly until the protrusions of terminal housing <b>84</b> engage the notches of inner casing <b>86</b>.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the protrusions (one shown in broken lines in FIG. 7) are substantially ramp-shaped members with abutment surfaces facing in a longitudinal direction towards the first end of the terminal housing <b>84</b>. The notches have mating abutment surfaces that face in an axial direction towards the second open end of the inner casing <b>86</b>. Thus, relative axial movement of the terminal housing <b>84</b> away from the inner casing <b>86</b> is prevented. Moreover, the annular flange of the terminal housing <b>84</b> abuts the first open end of the inner casing <b>86</b> to prevent further inward axial movement of the terminal housing <b>84</b> relative to the inner casing <b>86</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring still to FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>12</b>, the outer casing <b>88</b> is molded over end portions of primary cable <b>32</b> and secondary cable <b>36</b>. Outer casing <b>88</b> also extends into the side openings of the tubular side wall of the inner casing <b>86</b>. The outer casing <b>88</b> is also formed of a non-conductive material such as a plastic or elastomeric material. During the molding process, the material of the outer casing <b>88</b> is molded over the entire inner casing <b>86</b>, as well as portions of the primary cable <b>32</b>, secondary cable <b>36</b> and the terminal housing <b>84</b>. Accordingly, the interface between the terminal housing <b>84</b> and the first open end of the inner casing <b>86</b> is sealed to prevent contaminants from entering therebetween. Moreover, the material of the outer casing covers both annular flanges and extends into the annular recess of terminal housing <b>84</b> to ensure a watertight seal.</p>
    <p>The side openings of inner casing <b>86</b> are designed to allow the material of the outer casing <b>88</b> to freely flow into the interior of the inner casing <b>86</b> so as to completely cover the ends of the electrical conductors <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and <b>62</b>, and the connection ends of the terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and <b>82</b> <i>b</i>. This ensures a good waterproof connection therebetween. Moreover, by completely encasing the electrical connections between electrical conductors <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and <b>62</b>, and the connection ends of the terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and <b>82</b> <i>b</i>, the electrical connections are very durable and less resistant to detachment due to vibrations.</p>
    <p>The free end of outer casing <b>88</b> is preferably spaced from the exterior surface of the terminal housing <b>84</b>. Thus, an annular space is formed between terminal housing <b>84</b> and outer casing <b>88</b> for receiving a portion of the male connector therein. Preferably, the outer casing <b>88</b> has an annular abutment flange located at its open end for mating with the corresponding annular flange of the male connector. Preferably, the material of the outer casing <b>88</b> is constructed of a resilient material so that the annular flange of the male connector can expand the outer casing <b>88</b> radially outwardly so as to pass beneath the annular flange of the outer casing <b>88</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 15-23, electrical device (sensor) <b>22</b> is preferably a front wheel speed sensing unit that includes a mounting portion (mounting bracket) <b>70</b>, a sensing portion <b>72</b> and a magnet <b>74</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>), as best seen in FIGS. 15-17. Sensing portion <b>72</b> is preferably a magnetically operable sensor that is mounted on the front suspension fork <b>16</b> of bicycle <b>10</b> and senses the magnet <b>74</b> that is attached to one of the spokes of the front wheel <b>18</b> of bicycle <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sensing portion <b>72</b> includes a reed switch <b>76</b> for detecting the magnet <b>74</b>. Sensor <b>22</b> generates a pulse each time wheel <b>18</b> of bicycle <b>10</b> has turned a prescribed angle or rotation. The sensor <b>22</b> outputs a bicycle speed signal to the computer <b>20</b> by detecting magnet <b>74</b> mounted on front wheel <b>18</b> of bicycle <b>10</b>. In other words, the sensor <b>22</b> detects the rotational velocity of the front wheel <b>18</b> of bicycle <b>10</b>. Sensor <b>22</b> is relatively conventional, except for the manner in which sensor <b>22</b> is mounted to front suspension fork <b>16</b> and coupled to secondary cable <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>Basically, sensor (electrical device) <b>22</b> is designed to be mounted to a non-forward facing portion of front suspension fork <b>16</b>. Specifically, front suspension fork <b>16</b> includes a rearward facing mounting plate with a through bore formed therein. Mounting portion <b>70</b> of sensor <b>22</b> is a flange with a through bore formed therein. An insert nut <b>71</b> (FIGS. 15-17, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>) is received in the through bore of mounting portion <b>70</b> such that a threaded fastener is used to fixedly couple mounting portion <b>70</b> to front suspension fork <b>16</b> in a relatively conventional manner. Insert nut <b>71</b> includes a pair textured sections facilitating a friction or interference fit in the through bore formed in the mounting portion <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p>Sensing portion <b>72</b> is preferably formed of a cup-shaped hollow tubular member <b>78</b> <i>a </i>and a cap member <b>78</b> <i>b</i>, both constructed of a non-conductive material such as a hard, rigid plastic material. Cap member <b>78</b> <i>b </i>is mounted to an open end of tubular member <b>78</b> <i>a</i>. Tubular member <b>78</b> <i>a </i>includes a pair of longitudinal slots <b>79</b> <i>a </i>adjacent the closed end and a longitudinal threaded bore <b>79</b> <i>b </i>adjacent the open end. Reed switch <b>76</b> is mounted in slots <b>79</b> <i>a</i>, preferably by an interference fit or snap fit (or frictionally retained). Cap member <b>78</b> <i>b </i>is coupled to tubular member <b>78</b> <i>a </i>via a threaded fastener <b>79</b> <i>c </i>received in the threaded bore <b>79</b> <i>b </i>of tubular member <b>78</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>As seen in FIGS. 15-21, cap member <b>78</b> <i>b </i>includes a through bore sized to receive secondary cable <b>36</b> therethrough and a stepped bore sized to receive the threaded fastener or screw <b>79</b> <i>c</i>. Secondary cable <b>36</b> is mechanically coupled to cap member <b>78</b> <i>b </i>and electrically coupled to reed switch <b>76</b>. Specifically, after an end of secondary cable <b>36</b> is inserted through the through bore of cap member <b>78</b> <i>b</i>, secondary cable <b>36</b> is tied into a knot on the inner side surface of cap member <b>78</b> <i>b</i>, as best seen in FIG. <b>17</b>. Individual third conductors <b>62</b> are then trimmed (if necessary) and soldered to contacts of reed switch <b>76</b> in a conventional manner. Cap member <b>78</b> <i>b </i>is then fixedly coupled to tubular member <b>78</b> <i>a </i>via threaded fastener <b>79</b> <i>c </i>to form sensing portion <b>72</b>. Reed switch <b>76</b> can be mounted in slots <b>79</b> <i>a </i>before/after individual conductors <b>62</b> are soldered to reed switch <b>76</b>. This structure prevents secondary cable <b>36</b> from becoming detached from sensor <b>22</b>. More specifically, this structure withstands a load of approximately 10.0 kg F applied to secondary cable <b>36</b>. Thus a durable structure is achieved.</p>
    <p>Once sensor <b>22</b> and secondary cable <b>22</b> are attached together, sensor <b>22</b> becomes a part of bicycle electrical connector cord <b>26</b>. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that bicycle electrical connector cord <b>26</b> could be used with other electrical devices (i.e. other than sensor <b>22</b>) as needed and/or desired. For example, bicycles can be designed with numerous electrical devices and sensors such as electrically operated derailleurs, brakes, cadence sensors, chain position or tension sensors, etc. which could use the bicycle electrical connector cord <b>26</b> of the present invention as needed and/or desired.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 2, <b>3</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>, as mentioned above, first electrical connector <b>30</b> is similar to second electrical connector <b>34</b>. Specifically, first electrical connector <b>30</b> is identical to second electrical connector <b>34</b>, except that the size and shape of first electrical connector <b>30</b> is slightly different, and the configuration of the terminal pins <b>42</b> is modified from second electrical connector <b>34</b>. More specifically, first electrical connector <b>30</b> utilizes four terminal pins <b>42</b> (identical to terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>a</i>) and does not use terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Basically, first electrical connector <b>30</b> is smaller than second electrical connector <b>34</b> because only a portion of the primary cable <b>32</b> is received therein (rather than both the primary cable <b>32</b> and the secondary cable <b>36</b> received in the second electrical connector <b>34</b>). Additionally, no short terminal pins <b>82</b> <i>b </i>are used in the first electrical connector <b>30</b>. In other words, all four terminal pins <b>42</b> of first electrical connector <b>30</b> are designed to mate with receptor pins of the male connector of cycle computer <b>20</b>. First electrical connector <b>30</b> is constructed in a manner identical to second electrical connector <b>34</b>. In view of the similarities between the first and second electrical connectors <b>30</b> and <b>34</b>, first electrical connector <b>30</b> will not be discussed or illustrated in further detail herein. Rather, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that most of the descriptions of the second electrical connector <b>34</b> also apply to the first electrical connector <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 1, <b>2</b> and <b>26</b>, front suspension fork <b>16</b> with suspension units <b>24</b> will now be discussed in more detail. The particular construction of the front suspension fork <b>16</b> is not critical to the present invention. There are currently numerous types of adjustable suspensions for bicycle <b>10</b> that can be utilized to carry out the present invention. Preferably, the front suspension fork <b>16</b> utilizes two conventional air shocks with hydraulic dampening mechanisms that have been modified to carry out the present invention.</p>
    <p>For the sake of simplicity, only one of the suspension units <b>24</b> from of front suspension fork <b>16</b> will be discussed and illustrated herein. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that a pair of shocks or suspension units <b>24</b> are utilized to form the front suspension fork <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>As seen in FIG. 26, each suspension unit <b>24</b> basically includes outer and inner tubular telescoping members <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> defining inner cavities <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> in the suspension unit <b>24</b>. The outer tubular member <b>91</b> is coupled to the front hub of the front wheel <b>18</b> by a mounting member <b>96</b>, while the inner tubular member <b>92</b> is coupled to the main frame <b>12</b> by a mounting member <b>97</b>. The outer tubular member <b>91</b> has the lower hydraulic cavity that receives the bottom end <b>92</b> <i>a </i>of the inner tubular member <b>92</b>. The bottom end <b>92</b> <i>a </i>of the inner tubular member <b>92</b> forms a piston that has a plurality of orifices <b>98</b>. The orifices <b>98</b> fluidly couple the inner hydraulic cavities <b>93</b> and <b>94</b> together such that hydraulic fluid flows from the lower hydraulic cavity <b>93</b> to the upper hydraulic cavity <b>94</b> formed by a portion of the inner tubular member <b>92</b>. The inner tubular member <b>92</b> also has the air cavity or chamber <b>95</b> formed above the upper hydraulic cavity <b>94</b>.</p>
    <p>The air chamber <b>95</b> and upper hydraulic cavity <b>94</b> are separated by an axially slidable piston <b>99</b>. Within the air chamber <b>95</b> is a coil spring <b>100</b>. The stiffness of the suspension unit <b>24</b> is controlled by changing the size of the orifices <b>98</b> utilizing a control disk <b>101</b> that is rotatably mounted to change the size of the orifices <b>98</b>. In other words, the control disk <b>101</b> is moveable to change the amount of overlapping or closing of the orifices <b>98</b>. Preferably, the control disk <b>101</b> of the suspension unit <b>24</b> is controlled by a electric motor <b>102</b> that rotates the control disk <b>101</b>.</p>
    <p>The electric motor <b>102</b> is electrically coupled to the cycle computer <b>20</b> that selectively operates the electrical motor <b>102</b> to adjust the stiffness of the suspension units <b>24</b>. More specifically, electric motor <b>102</b> is electrically coupled to a pair of electrical contacts <b>104</b> in a conventional manner such that the electric motor <b>102</b> of each suspension unit <b>24</b> receives the same current and/or control signal (i.e. such that suspension units <b>24</b> have identical dampening characteristics). A pair of mating electrical contacts <b>105</b> of the male connector of front suspension fork <b>16</b> are electrically coupled to electrical contacts <b>104</b> and a pair of terminal pins of the male connector in a conventional manner. Thus, the orifices <b>98</b> and the control disk <b>101</b> form a front suspension control valve <b>103</b> that is automatically adjusted via the cycle computer <b>20</b>. The electric motors <b>102</b> and the front cylinder control valves <b>103</b> of the suspension units <b>24</b> form a front controller or adjustment mechanism that changes or adjusts the stiffness or softness of the front suspension fork <b>16</b> based on the cycle computer <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>Of course, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that other types of adjustment mechanisms can be utilized for controlling the stiffness of the suspension units <b>24</b>. Moreover, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various conventional circuitry (capacitors, resistors, etc.) can be used with front suspension fork <b>16</b> as needed and/or desired to carry out the present invention. Furthermore, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that bicycle electrical connector cord <b>26</b> could be used with other electronically controlled or operated components such as brakes, derailleurs, etc. as needed and/or desired.</p>
    <p>The terms of degree such as “substantially”, “about” and “approximately” as used herein mean a reasonable amount of deviation of the modified term such that the end result is not significantly changed. These terms should be construed as including a deviation of at least ±5% of the modified term if this deviation would not negate the meaning of the word it modifies.</p>
    <p>While only a selected embodiment has been chosen to illustrate the present invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that various changes and modifications can be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. Furthermore, the foregoing description of the embodiment according to the present invention is provided for illustration only, and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
