    <p>FIGS. 4 through 8 are configuration diagrams of the picking unit <b>7</b> attached to the mimic guitar <b>5</b>. In FIGS. 4 through 8, the picking unit <b>7</b> is comprised of a picking blade <b>72</b> wherein the tip portion of a rib-shaped piece <b>721</b> is swingably axially supported in the longitudinal direction centered around a shaft <b>71</b> within a certain angle range, an elastic member <b>73</b> which is positioned at the base portion of the picking blade <b>72</b> and serves as a restoring means for restoring the tip portion of the rib-shaped piece <b>721</b> automatically so as to face outwards, a turning detector <b>74</b> for detecting the turning of this picking blade <b>72</b>, and an attachment plate <b>76</b> with attachment holes <b>75</b> for attaching to the main body of the mimic guitar <b>5</b>, wherein sound generation signals are output for the first turning detecting timing of the picking plate by the turning detector <b>74</b> as the sound generation instructing timing, as described later.</p>
    <p>This elastic member <b>73</b> may be a compression spring, or may be an elastic material such as rubber. The elastic member <b>73</b> is provided at four corners, i.e., two places for each swinging direction, so as to uniformly press the base portion of the picking blade <b>72</b> and maintain the balance thereof. Picking the rib-shaped piece <b>721</b> downwards as indicated by the imaginary line A shown in FIG. 8, causes the two elastic members <b>73</b> to the lower side to be compressed, and the two elastic members <b>73</b> to the upper side are stretched, so that the pressing force of the elastic members <b>73</b> on the picking blade <b>72</b> acts to cause the rib-shaped piece <b>721</b> to rock upwards as indicated by the imaginary line B shown in FIG. 8</p>
    <p>Also, the swing detector <b>74</b> has oppositely-positioned element attaching members <b>741</b> attached to the attachment plate <b>76</b> with a holding member <b>77</b> introduced therebetween, transmitting photo-sensors <b>742</b> positioned to the element attaching members <b>741</b> so that the photo-emitting side and photo-receptor side are arranged in an oppositely facing manner, and a light-shielding piece <b>743</b> movable between the photo-emitting side and photo-receptor side, such that in the event that the picking blade <b>72</b> is stationary the light-shielding piece <b>743</b> shields the photo-sensor <b>742</b> so the photo-sensor <b>742</b> is in an off state, and in the event that the rib-shaped piece <b>721</b> is picked the light-shielding piece <b>743</b> moves in accordance with the rocking of the picking plate <b>72</b> and the photo-sensor <b>742</b> turns on, following which a sound generation instructing signal is output at a certain timing. This sound generation instruction signal is output after the lapse of a predetermined time from the first off time following on the photo-sensor <b>742</b> turning on. This is in order to approximate the state of an actual guitar string being picked to generate sound, in order to create a more realistic atmosphere.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 is a block diagram illustrating the control configuration of the rhythm game apparatus <b>1</b> shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. In FIG. 9, the control means <b>11</b> has a PCM data storage unit <b>12</b>, a main RAM <b>13</b> capable of reading and writing various types of data, a sound processor <b>14</b> connected to the PCM data storage unit <b>12</b> for extracting sound generation data from the PCM data storage unit <b>12</b> and performing sound generation control, a mixing device <b>17</b> connected to the sound processor <b>14</b> for mixing the sound generation data from the sound processor <b>14</b> and background music data from a CD-ROM <b>15</b> for output to a speaker <b>16</b> serving as sound generation device, graphic RAM <b>18</b> serving as graphic storage means for storing image data for the monitor <b>2</b>, a graphic RAM <b>19</b> connected to the monitor <b>2</b> for extracting the image data within the graphic controller <b>18</b> and performing display control to the monitor <b>2</b>, an interface <b>20</b> for receiving input signals from the mimic guitars <b>5</b> and CD-ROM <b>15</b>, a lamp driving unit <b>21</b> connected to the lamps <b>6</b> for driving the lighting of the lamps <b>6</b>, and a CPU (Central Processing Unit) <b>22</b> for controlling each portion. A graphic controller is comprised of the main RAM <b>13</b>, graphic RAM <b>18</b>, graphic controller <b>19</b>, and CPU <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>The PCM data storage unit <b>12</b> stores each sound of sound generation data (type of sound data; type selected with buttons R, G, B) of a played music piece. Such sound generation data for multiple music pieces for each play level is stored in the PCM data storage unit <b>12</b>. This sound generation data consists of sector No. provided to the CD-ROM <b>15</b>, sound No. (Nos. provided to each of a series of sounds arrayed in a time system for each played music piece), sound generation length, and type of neck button (R, G, B). Also, as shown in the notes display <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 14, the graphic RAM <b>18</b> divides the rhythm sounds (notes bar <b>34</b> corresponding to the rhythm sounds) of a played music piece comprised containing at least rhythm sounds into certain intervals (which may be different for each sound, or may be the same) in the time direction C, and also stores each of a series of rhythm sounds constructed by appropriating to the three types (R, G, B) on the same time axis, for each sound, as image data for the above-described monitor <b>2</b>. This image data is subjected to data loading from the CD-ROM <b>15</b> in the later-described step ST<b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>Also, the CD-ROM <b>15</b> serving as the storage medium is comprised of a so-called ROM cassette wherein a plastic case houses ROM and the like storing the above image data, and also the background music data for played music pieces, and further storing the selective sound group data (type of neck button) and the specified generation timing data (sound No.) of each sound, and storing score data according the degree of matching of these, and storing program data such as programs for the rhythm game, operating system, and so forth. The recording medium may be comprised of an optical disk or a flexible disk or the like, instead of the CD-ROM <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, the graphic RAM <b>18</b> stores screens (FIGS. 12 through 18) according to the later-described game conditions and data related thereof, such as notes screen data for instruction operation for visually guiding the instruction operation with the mimic guitar <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p>The CPU <b>22</b> causes an not-shown reading device to read the program data and data related thereto (score data, selective sound group data, true sound generation timing data, etc.) within the CD-ROM <b>15</b> from the CD-ROM <b>15</b>, to be written to the main RAM <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>Also, the CPU <b>22</b> controls the graphic controller <b>19</b> according to the processing state of the stage selection, based on the program, and extracts necessary image data from the graphic RAM <b>18</b> and displays this on the monitor <b>2</b>, while performing game stage selection processing by operation with the neck buttons R, G, B on the mimic guitar <b>5</b> and the start button <b>3</b>. This stage selection processing includes selection of one player to play or two players to play, selection of difficulty, and selection of played music piece.</p>
    <p>For example, in the event of selecting two players to play, this is selected by depositing a certain monetary amount from both left and right coin deposit openings <b>4</b> of the rhythm game apparatus <b>1</b>, and the CPU <b>22</b> controls the graphic controller <b>19</b> to display a display screen on the monitor <b>2</b> such as shown in FIG. 12 (“credits <b>02</b>” indicating two players to play), using the data within the graphic RAM <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>Selection of difficulty involves a difficulty selection screen (guidance “select with neck button”, “confirm with start button”) on the monitor <b>2</b> such as shown in FIG. <b>12</b>, the player sequentially selecting from the three stages of play level of advanced (expert), medium (normal), and beginner (practice) with the neck button R or the neck button G, and the CPU <b>22</b> controlling the graphic controller <b>19</b> according to the level of difficulty selected thereby to control display on the monitor <b>2</b> such that the title and number of shining stars change. For example, in FIG. 12, a screen of a bear holding a mimic guitar <b>5</b> is displayed on the monitor <b>2</b> with the title “PRACTICE” of the beginner stage and two of the six stars shining, from which pressing the neck button R once changes the screen displayed on the monitor <b>2</b> to that wherein a bear holding a different mimic guitar with the title “NORMAL” of the medium stage comes up and four of the six stars are shining, and further, pressing the neck button R once more changes the screen displayed on the monitor <b>2</b> to that wherein a bear holding another different mimic guitar with the title “EXPERT” of the advanced stage comes up and six of the stars are shining, and moreover, pressing the neck button R once more returns to the beginner “PRACTICE” screen. Incidentally, the arrangement is such that each time the neck button B is pressed, the play level changes in reverse from advanced to medium to beginner. Pressing the start button <b>3</b> according to the operation guidance “confirm with start button” determines the play level displayed on the monitor <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, for selecting the played music piece, a plurality of (five in the present embodiment) mimic guitars with shapes according to the played music piece are displayed on the monitor <b>2</b> as shown in FIG. 13, and the title of a played music piece corresponding to the mimic guitar at the center (the center guitar is shining, and the other guitars are not shining, as represented by the hatching) is displayed on the monitor <b>2</b>. From this display state, each time the neck button R is pressed, the five mimic guitars sequentially move to the right, with the mimic guitar situated at the far right moving to the far left, and the title of a played music piece corresponding to the mimic guitar at the center is displayed. Also, the arrangement is such that each time the neck button B is pressed, the five mimic guitars sequentially move in the opposite direction (to the left) as that with the neck button R. The title of the played music piece “Chicago Blue” is displayed at the title portion of the screen of the monitor <b>2</b> shown in FIG. 13, indicating the state that the same has been selected. In the event that this selected piece is suitable, the start button <b>3</b> is pressed according to the operation guidance “confirm with start button” on the monitor <b>2</b>, thereby confirming the played music piece.</p>
    <p>Also, the CPU <b>22</b> has a judging means for judging whether or not the sound data selected with the neck buttons (sound group selector) R, G, B, is instructed as operating timing within the certain interval by operating of the picking unit <b>7</b> according to the sound generation control procedures of the program; a sound generation controller for extracting one piece of sound generation data from the played music piece from the PCM data storage unit <b>12</b> with the sound processor <b>14</b> according to the type of neck button R, G, B from the mimic guitar <b>5</b> and the generation timing (sound No.) thereof, in a state affirmed by the judging means at least, this one piece of sound generation data being output to the mixing unit <b>17</b> where the one piece of sound generation data and background music data from the CD-ROM <b>15</b> are mixed and sound is generated from the speaker <b>16</b>; and a display device for updating notes screen data according to the time-system group of the played piece according to the notes display control procedures of the program, and also performing display control on the monitor <b>2</b> of whether or not there has been a miss in the input operation with the mimic guitar <b>5</b>; and rhythm input instrumental unit for following the rhythm input operating evaluating procedures of the program to check the selection operation of the mimic guitar <b>5</b>, and compare the generation instruction timing with the true generation timing of the sound, and perform evaluation of instruction operation for the score data according to the degree of matching, whereby points are added to the score. The sound generation controller has difference amount detector and sound generation control means.</p>
    <p>Detailed description will now be made regarding the sound generation control processing and the display control processing. The CPU <b>22</b> via the sound processor <b>14</b> obtains the CD sector No. where the sound generation data of the PCM data storage unit <b>12</b> corresponding to the next sound generation of the selected piece is to be positioned, and controls the graphic controller <b>19</b> such that image data is read from the graphic RAM <b>18</b> which is the graphic storage means to the next notes display position <b>31</b> so as to update it, thereby displaying on the monitor <b>2</b> as shown in FIG. 14 or FIG. <b>15</b>. That is to say, the sector No. for which the CD head is searching is obtained at each interruption in the program, and the note display position <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 14 or FIG. 15 is moved one step upwards, so that the player selects and operates the neck button corresponding to the R, G, B notes bar <b>34</b> which has reached the reference line <b>32</b> at the topmost position, and also picks the picking unit <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>In this way, the operator watches the notes display (neck button operating procedures) <b>31</b> at the left side of the monitor <b>2</b> in FIG. 14, and operates the neck button R, G, B, with the left hand along with the background music, and also operates the picking lever <b>72</b> with the right hand to input operating signals to the CPU <b>22</b>. At this time, the CPU <b>22</b> obtains the degree of matching with the time-system data in the table, at the point that there is signal input within the certain timing period.</p>
    <p>This degree of matching is the extent to which the type of neck button (R, G, B) operated and the timing of picking match. For example, in the event that the sound generation has the sector No. obtained at the time of picking input and the sector No. of the corresponding time-system data within the certain interval, and also that the next button written to the neck button type on the same table has been pressed, the sound data corresponding to the sound No. within the same table is emitted for the sound generation length of that sound data. Also, in the event that the type of neck button is correct, but the picking is made extending before or after the certain interval (a case wherein the picking is not contained within the certain interval), the operation is admitted, and comparison is made in the corresponding table before and after, and the close is emitted as sound. The display to the monitor <b>2</b> at this time is a “fail” display (gray). Incidentally, a “success” display is lit as a color corresponding to the operated neck button R, G, B with the notes bar <b>34</b> of the notes display <b>31</b>. Also, in the event that the picking input time is within the certain interval but the neck button type is wrong, a sound No. is obtained from the table with the data of the closest same type of button. The display to the monitor <b>2</b> at this time also is a “fail” display (gray). In this way, the CPU <b>22</b> controls the sound processor <b>14</b> to obtain sound data from the PCM data storage device <b>12</b> for the sound selected by the player with the neck button at the timing of operating the picking lever, which is generated via the speaker <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>Next, the instruction operation evaluating processing will be described in detail. The CPU <b>22</b> is arranged so as to extract score points from the score point table according to various conditions such as amount of picking difference from the reference timing range, different neck button types, whether continuous input operations are correct or not, whether there is no input of operating instructing signals which should be made within the certain timing period, and so forth, following the instruction operation evaluation procedures of the program and the game data, thereby calculating the score. Also, the CPU <b>22</b> is arranged to calculate the amount of time (gauge amount) necessary till sound generation. Based on the gauge amount calculation results and the score calculation results, the calculated score points are added to the accumulated score points and updated and stored to the main RAM <b>13</b>, and at the same time the calculated gauge amount is subtracted from the remaining life amount and the remaining life amount is updated, so that the remaining life amount is displayed on the monitor <b>2</b> as a horizontal bar graph <b>33</b>. In the even that there is no updated remaining life amount, the CPU <b>22</b> displays a “Game Over” display such as shown in FIG. 17 on the monitor <b>2</b>, and the rhythm game is ended.</p>
    <p>Further, tower picking of the mimic guitar <b>5</b> will be described. An over-turn detecting unit (not shown) is set within the mimic guitar <b>5</b>, so as to detect the angle of the mimic guitar <b>5</b> while playing. By adding an action of holding the mimic guitar <b>5</b> vertically at a certain point in the played music piece as shown in FIG. 19, the over-turn detecting unit detects this and outputs a detection signals, whereby the CPU <b>22</b> obtains high score points from the main RAM <b>13</b>, adds to the score and stores in the main RAM <b>13</b>, following the tower picking evaluation procedures of the program, and at the same time the arrangement is such that the lamp driving unit <b>21</b> is controlled to light the lamps <b>6</b>, thereby staging a fanatical live performance. This action is in order to encourage over-acting while playing the game, so there are no minus actions taken such as reducing the score in the event that this action is not performed. Also, regarding the detection timing for this action, since there are differences in the action and many different operation images, a guitar mark appears to the right side of the notes display portion <b>31</b> from one frame ahead as shown in FIG. 20, this guitar mark ascends along with the group of the played music piece, so that the timing matches if the mimic guitar <b>5</b> is raised when this reaches the position of the reference line <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p>The operation of the above configuration will be described below. FIG. 10 is a groupchart illustrating the operation of the rhythm-matching game apparatus shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. As shown in FIG. 10, first, in step ST<b>1</b>, stage selection is made from the various stages. That is, whether one is to play or two is to play is selected by depositing a certain monetary amount in both coin deposit openings <b>4</b> on the left and right side of the rhythm game apparatus <b>1</b>, or by depositing in only one. An initial display screen such as shown in FIG. 12 is displayed on the monitor <b>2</b>, and a display such as “credits <b>02</b>” is made in the event that two are to play. Also, coins for two have been deposited by only one person has taken a mimic guitar <b>5</b>, so the display screen displays a comment such as “OK to participate partway through” shown in FIG. 12 is displayed in order to urge another to play.</p>
    <p>Also, this display screen is a difficulty display screen, where selection is sequentially made from the three stages of play level of advanced (expert), medium (normal), and beginner (practice) with the neck button R or G, following the difficulty selection guidance “select with neck button”, and for example, the beginner title “PRACTICE” with two of the six stars shining as shown in FIG. 12 is selected. Next, the start button <b>3</b> is pressed following the operation guidance of “confirm with start button” on the monitor <b>2</b>, confirming the beginner level for the play level.</p>
    <p>Further, selection of the played music piece is performed by five mimic guitars having shapes corresponding to the played music piece being displayed on the monitor <b>2</b> as shown in FIG. 13, and the played music piece being selected by pressing the neck button R. In FIG. 13, the title of the played music piece “Chicago Blue” corresponding to the mimic guitar at the center is displayed. In the event that this is suitable, the start button <b>3</b> is pressed following the operating guidance “confirm with start button” on the display screen, thereby confirming the played music piece.</p>
    <p>Next, data loading is performed in step ST<b>2</b>. Programs instructing the procedures of the rhythm-matching game and related data other than background music data is read into the main RAM <b>13</b> from the recording medium CD-ROM <b>15</b> via the flash ROM on the main substrate. In other words, the background music is directly generated from the speaker <b>16</b> as background music sounds from the CD-ROM <b>15</b> shown in FIG. 9 via the mixing unit <b>17</b>. Thus, when preparations for playing are completed, the game screen is displayed on the monitor <b>2</b> in step ST<b>3</b>. FIG. 14 illustrates the game screen for a single player, and FIG. 15 illustrates the game screen for two players. Here, the screen for a single player will be described, in order to facilitate ease of description. A notes display <b>31</b> is carried out to the left side of the monitor <b>2</b>, showing the neck button operating procedures for the selected music piece, displayed with different colors for each of the neck buttons R, G, and B, and the playing of the selected piece thus starts.</p>
    <p>Further, in step ST<b>4</b> the CPU <b>22</b> obtains the CD sector No. that the CD is currently playing, and in step ST<b>5</b> updates the position of the notes display <b>31</b>. The player watches the notes display <b>31</b> (neck button operating procedures) at the left side of the monitor <b>2</b>, and operates at least one of the neck buttons R, G, and B with the left hand, and also operates the picking lever <b>72</b> with the right hand, along with the background music, thereby outputting the instruction signal to the CPU <b>22</b>. At this time, the CPU <b>22</b> judges whether or not there has been signal input within the certain timing period in step ST<b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>At the point that there has been operating input by picking performed by the player in step ST<b>6</b>, in step ST<b>7</b> the degree of matching of the type of operated neck buttons R, G, and B and the picking timing with the time-system data (the type of buttons and the true generation timing of sounds) in the table is obtained, and in step ST<b>8</b>, the CPU <b>22</b> controls the sound processor <b>14</b> to obtain sound data for the played music piece from the PCM data storing unit <b>12</b>, based on the type of button selected with at least one of the neck buttons R, G, and B at the timing that the picking lever <b>72</b> was operated, which is generated via the speaker <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, in step ST<b>9</b>, calculation of the remaining life amount (gauge amount) wherein the game can be played, and calculation of the score is performed. Score points are extracted form the score point table according to conditions such as amount of picking difference from the reference timing range, wrong neck button types, correct continuous input operations, cases wherein there is no input of operating instructing signals which should be made within the certain timing period in step ST<b>6</b>, such as described above and the score is calculated. Also, the amount of time necessary for the operating input is calculated.</p>
    <p>Further, based on the gauge amount calculation and score calculation results in step ST<b>9</b>, the gauge, score, and staged effects are updated in step ST<b>10</b>. The score points calculated in step ST<b>9</b> are added to the accumulated score points and updated and stored in the main RAM <b>13</b>. Also, the gauge amount calculated in step ST<b>9</b> is subtracted from the remaining life amount and the remaining life amount is updated and recorded, and the remaining life amount is displayed on the monitor <b>2</b> as a horizontal bar graph, as shown by <b>33</b> in FIG. <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, in step ST<b>11</b>, the CPU <b>22</b> judges whether or not there is updated remaining life amount, and in the event that there is no remaining life amount a “Game Over” display such as shown in FIG. 17 is displayed on the screen on the monitor <b>2</b> in step ST<b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, in step ST<b>13</b>, judgment is made whether or not the selected piece has ended, by detecting whether or not there is an ending symbol which has been added to the end of the PCM data of the selected piece which the CPU <b>22</b> has obtained via the sound processor <b>14</b>. In step ST<b>13</b>, in the event that the CPU <b>22</b> judges that the playing of the selected music piece has not ended, the group returns to step ST<b>3</b>, performs the series of processing for the next sound (steps ST<b>3</b> through ST<b>13</b>), which is repeated until the playing of the selected music piece ends.</p>
    <p>In the event that the CPU <b>22</b> detects the ending symbol which has been added to the end of the PCM data of the selected piece and thus judges in step ST<b>13</b> that playing of the selected piece has ended, in step ST<b>14</b> the CPU <b>22</b> controls the graphic controller to display a stage results display such as shown in FIG. 16 on the monitor <b>2</b> as an evaluation of the playing, based on the score calculation results.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, in step ST<b>15</b>, the CPU <b>22</b> judges whether or not the stipulated number of stages (e.g., up to three selected pieces can be selected) has been achieved, and end in the event that this has been achieved, and returns to step ST<b>1</b> to repeat the above series of actions in the event that this has not been achieved.</p>
    <p>Next, description will be made regarding the peripheral demo. FIG. 11 is a groupchart illustrating the peripheral demo for the rhythm game device shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. First, in step ST<b>21</b>, a warning screen displaying a warning text such as age restriction or the like is displayed on the monitor screen, in step ST<b>22</b> the Konami logo mark is displayed, in step ST<b>23</b>, an opening video is displayed, in step ST<b>24</b>, the title for this rhythm-matching game is displayed, and further, in step ST<b>25</b>, how to play this rhythm-matching game (operation method) is explained.</p>
    <p>Further, in step ST<b>26</b>, a noted piece demo is performed. That is, the number of times that each piece has been selected in the rhythm game is recorded following data initialization once every certain period such as a week, and that data is used to read the date and time, and a piece matching that period such as the season, day of the week, or the like is introduced, and also the piece with the greatest number of selections when demo looping is output as audio as the “No. 1 popular piece”.</p>
    <p>In step ST<b>27</b>, the name of the high-score player and the high score thereof for the week is displayed in order of high score, thus performing a ranking demo. Subsequently, the group returns to the warning screen in step ST<b>21</b>. Incidentally, the rhythm game apparatus <b>1</b> is arranged such that the player name can be input from input means in the event that a certain high-score value is passed.</p>
    <p>In the event that a coin is deposited during the above routine, the title display in step ST<b>24</b> is performed.</p>
    <p>The operation of the refrain mode for practice will be described. When the setting for the refrain mode is made, first, a teacher for performing a model performance appears on the monitor <b>2</b> and plays a certain practice piece, which the player listens to and learns the sense of timing. Next, a monitor screen such as shown in FIG. 18 is displayed, and the neck button operating procedures for that practice piece are displayed on the position of the notes display <b>31</b>, along with which at least one type from the neck buttons R, G, B and picking is performed, whereby sound is generated according to the type of neck button and picking timing. In the event that the type of neck button and picking timing of the player match that of the teacher, the notes bar <b>34</b> of the notes display <b>31</b> is displayed with the colors R, G, and B, corresponding with the types of neck buttons, and in the event that this does not match, the RGB colors disappear and become gray, thereby allowing judgment whether or not this has matched.</p>
    <p>The sound generation control and instruction operation evaluation is performed according to the sound group selection (type of buttons R, G, B) with the left hand of the mimic guitar <b>5</b> and the instruction timing with the right hand, so a rhythm-matching game can be enjoyed relatively easily in a manner closer to a realistic state of playing an instrument, fully using the right hand and left hand.</p>
    <p>When conducting this rhythm-matching game, the changing sound group selection and the true sound generation timings arc displayed on the monitor <b>2</b>, so the rhythm-matching game can be performed in an easier and more sure manner, such that rhythm-matching becomes easier for even relatively difficult pieces, so the game becomes even more enjoyable.</p>
    <p>The present embodiment is a case wherein the rhythm game apparatus <b>1</b> is applied to playing with a mimic guitar <b>5</b>, and the player can perform the rhythm-matching game in a manner closer to a realistic state using the right hand and left hand.</p>
    <p>Further, according to the picking unit <b>7</b> of the present embodiment, a simpler configuration can be used to obtain a realistic feel close to that of picking a mimic guitar <b>5</b>, and more precise generation instruction can be attempted.</p>
    <p>The sound generation is made based on the degree of matching of the sound group selection and instruction timing, so sound generation according to the played music piece can be made in a more natural manner.</p>
    <p>The way of holding the rhythm input instrumental unit <b>7</b> can be changed with the sensation of a live performance, such that in the case of a mimic guitar <b>5</b>, the action of raising along with the music allows the rhythm-matching game to be enjoyed in a more fanatical manner.</p>
    <p>Incidentally, though the configuration with the present embodiment has been described as with the notes display <b>31</b> in FIG. 14, as shown in FIG. 21, the display for instructing the sound generation timing with the display device has the identification marks <b>35</b> being sequentially display by scrolling from one side of the display screen of the display means (monitor <b>2</b>) to the other side, and timing marks <b>36</b> are moved and displayed so as to head for the corresponding identification marks <b>35</b> from the position generally corresponding to the identification marks <b>35</b>, in a direction at right angles with the above scrolling direction, so that at the point that the display position between the identification mark <b>35</b> displayed at the other-most side and the timing mark <b>36</b> corresponding to this identification mark <b>35</b> reach a certain relation, preferably the point of matching, this is instructed as the sound generation timing. In this example shown in the Figure, the one side of the display screen is the right side of FIG. 21, and the other side is the left side in FIG. <b>21</b>.</p>
    <p>Incidentally, the present invention is not restricted to the above embodiment; rather, the following variations can also be employed.</p>
    <p>(1) The sound generation needs only to contain rhythm sound, out of rhythm sound, scales, and chord sounds (chords).</p>
    <p>(2) The rhythm input instrumental unit <b>7</b> is configured such that the picking blade <b>72</b> swings, but the present invention is not restricted to this, and an arrangement may be made wherein this slides; in effect, the picking blade <b>72</b> should be configured swingably.</p>
    <p>(3) The instruction timing of the instructor as to the sound data instructed as operating timing and the operating timing display instruction are compared, and the instruction operation is evaluated based on the amount of difference thereof, wherein the evaluation means may be evaluated form the total amount of difference obtained by accumulating the difference amount to each piece of sound data, or the evaluator may set a tolerance range before and after the operating timing for each sound data, and calculate score by accumulating subtraction parameters set according to the smallness of the amount of being off within the inner side of the boundary of the tolerance range as a reference thereof, and addition parameters set according to the greatness of the amount of being off at the outer side thereof.</p>
    <p>(4) In the node display <b>31</b>, the notes bars <b>34</b> of rhythm sounds sequentially move upwards along with elapsing of time, toward the reference line <b>32</b>, with the point of matching the reference line <b>32</b> being the operating timing, and here, the notes bars <b>34</b> move, but the invention is not restricted to this, so the reference line <b>32</b> may move, or the reference line <b>32</b> and the notes bars <b>34</b> may move, with the overlapping point being the operating instructing timing.</p>
    <p>(5) The arrangement is such that one or multiple pieces can be selected from five pieces for three stages of play levels, advanced (expert), medium (normal), and beginner (practice), but an arrangement may be made wherein multiple pieces (e.g., two) other than the five are hidden, and at the point that the selection of pieces remaining is close to being depleted, the hidden two pieces then appear on the monitor <b>2</b>, so as to be selectable. This reduces the unfairness for individuals selecting pieces at the point that the selection of pieces remaining is close to being depleted, and the rhythm-matching game can be enjoyed more.</p>
    <p>(6) A description has been made using mimic guitars <b>5</b> as the instrumental unit, but the invention is not restricted to this, and can be applied to instruments such as cellos, violins, ukuleles, shamisens, kotos, etc. In the case of cellos or violins, a bow-like member would be used instead of the picking.</p>
    <p>(7) The three neck buttons are provided, but this number may be one, or any other number, and in the case of a plurality thereof, this would mimic a guitar. Also, the operation input to the neck button may be performed to one neck button, or simultaneously with multiple neck buttons.</p>
    <p>(8) The one rhythm input instrumental unit <b>7</b> having a picking blade <b>72</b> is provided, but the invention is not restricted to this, and a plurality thereof may be provided. In this case, the more picking blades <b>72</b> there are provided, the more realistic the playing becomes, and in the event that six or twelve are provided for example corresponding to the strings on a guitar, guitar accompaniment and arpeggio, or even playing of melody and chords separately can be performed, thus coming closer to guitar playing and allowing the game to be enjoyed more.</p>
    <p>(9) The sound generation controller is configured so as to output the sound data instructed as the operating timing to the sound generation device and be generated, but the invention is not restricted to this, and the sound generation device may be controlled so as to conduct sound generation only of background music, without outputting instructed sound data to the sound generation device, with evaluation of the operation being displayed and output in the same manner as with the above embodiment.</p>
    <p>(10) The present embodiment uses the configuration shown in FIGS. 2 through 8 for the mimic guitar, but the present invention is not restricted to this. For example, such as shown in FIGS. 22 and 23 can be used.</p>
    <p>This mimic guitar <b>80</b> has three neck buttons R, G, and B, serving as the rhythm sound selecting means (sound group selector) for selecting the type of rhythm sound for each sound following the time-wise group of the played music piece from the plurality of rhythm sounds of the played music piece, a picking unit <b>83</b> serving as sound generation instructing member for instruction the generation of a sound in the sound group selected by the selecting operation of at least one neck button of these neck buttons R, G, and B, a push switch <b>81</b> provided lower than the picking unit <b>83</b> for switching added modes such as the echo mode (wherein generally the same type of sounds are generated in a sequential manner) and chorus mode (wherein different types of sounds are generated generally at the same time), and a push switch <b>82</b> for starting playing. These neck buttons R, G, and B are left-hand input means for inputting guitar chords and the like, and the picking unit <b>83</b> is a right-hand input means for inputting guitar picking; the left-hand and right-hand arrangements may be reversed.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 23A and 23B are configuration diagrams of the picking unit <b>83</b> attached to the mimic guitar <b>80</b> shown in FIG. <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>This picking unit <b>83</b> has a picking blade <b>84</b>, an elastic nipping member <b>100</b> swingably supporting this picking blade <b>84</b>, and swing detector <b>86</b> for detecting the swinging of the picking blade <b>84</b> provided to both sides of the base of the picking blade <b>84</b>. Also, as shown in FIGS. 22 through 24, this mimic guitar <b>80</b> is comprised of a main body <b>80</b>A, a neck unit <b>80</b>B to which the neck buttons R, G, and B are provided, and a rear unit <b>80</b>C, with an opening <b>80</b> <i>a </i>provided in the main body <b>80</b>A and an opening <b>80</b> <i>b </i>provided in the neck unit <b>80</b>B generally matching.</p>
    <p>The picking blade <b>84</b> is formed so as to have a mountain-shaped cross-sectional form with the base opened, having an apex <b>841</b>, two protrusions <b>842</b> formed protruding at a certain thickness downwards from two locations on the inner side of the apex <b>841</b>, two shaft portions <b>843</b> having round cross-sectional forms protruding outwards from both sides, and two pressing portions <b>844</b> wherein the wall thickness of the picking blade <b>84</b> has been made thick from around the center in the height direction to the bottom side at the general center portion in the longitudinal direction at the inner plane. The pressing portions <b>844</b> act to press the swing detector <b>86</b> in the swinging direction, by the swinging of the picking blade <b>84</b>.</p>
    <p>The shaft portions <b>843</b> are swingably supported at recessed bearings <b>85</b> <i>a </i>provided to the attachment member <b>85</b> linked to the main body <b>80</b>A via later-described screw <b>95</b>. In this supported state, the apex <b>841</b> side protrudes outwards through both openings <b>80</b> <i>a </i>and <b>80</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Also, one of the two constant thickness protrusions <b>842</b> is supported by an elastic nipping member <b>100</b> having a general shape of a box with one side open, attached to the attachment member <b>85</b> with a screw <b>99</b>. Incidentally, the two protrusions <b>842</b> are provided at symmetrical positions in the longitudinal direction of the picking blade <b>84</b>. This elastic nipping member <b>100</b> is formed of a spring material, has two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a</i>, and the protrusion <b>842</b> is inserted between the two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a</i>. Accordingly, when the picking blade <b>84</b> is picked and rotates, the constant thickness protrusion <b>842</b> tilts and the gap between the two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a </i>begins to open, so conversely the two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a </i>attempt to close. Thus, the picking blade <b>84</b> returns to the original reference position.</p>
    <p>With the picking unit <b>83</b> this configured, picking the picking blade <b>84</b> toward a swinging direction causes the swing detector <b>86</b> at one side to press against the pressing portion <b>844</b> at the relevant side. The swing detector <b>86</b> outputs a sound generation instruction signal as a sound generation instruction timing at the point at that a certain amount of time has elapsed from the point of pressing thereof. The reason that such a time lapse is provided is to come closer to the state of an actual guitar string being played and generating sound, thereby creating a more realistic feel. Also, when the above picking is performed, the constant thickness protrusion <b>842</b> tilts and the gap between the two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a </i>begins to open, so conversely the two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a </i>attempt to close, so the picking blade <b>84</b> returns to the original reference position. The above is the same even in the case that the picking blade <b>84</b> is picked in the other swinging direction, though the relevant swing detector <b>86</b> is different.</p>
    <p>Also, with this configuration, the protrusion <b>842</b> is inserted between the two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a </i>to support the picking blade <b>84</b>, so there is the advantage that not only the picking unit <b>83</b> but also the mimic guitar <b>80</b> can be assembled extremely easily.</p>
    <p>Next, the assembly process for the mimic guitar <b>80</b> will be described with reference to FIGS. 24 through 30. FIG. 24 is a disassembled perspective view illustrating the overall assembly state, and FIGS. 25 through 30 are perspective view illustrating the assembly states of each portion.</p>
    <p>First, as shown in FIG. 25, the neck unit <b>80</b>B is attached to the main body <b>80</b>A via screws <b>101</b>. At this time, the attaching is performed such that both openings <b>80</b> <i>a </i>and <b>80</b> <i>b </i>match. Subsequent processes can be performed for each part, and the order does not matter.</p>
    <p>Regarding the neck buttons R, G, B portion, this is conducted as follows. As shown in FIG. 24, the neck buttons R, G, B are attached to the neck unit <b>80</b>B, push switches <b>90</b> are mounted on the neck buttons R, G, B, a substrate <b>91</b> is mounted thereupon, and the whole is fixed by screws <b>97</b>.</p>
    <p>Also, regarding the portion of the picking unit <b>83</b>, this is performed as follows. First. The picking blade <b>84</b> is placed in the opening <b>80</b> <i>a </i>of the main body <b>80</b>A with the apex <b>841</b> downwards, and the attachment member <b>85</b> is mounted thereupon with the bearing portions <b>85</b> <i>a </i>facing down. At this time, the attachment member <b>85</b> has an elastic nipping member <b>100</b> having a general shape of a box with one side open attached by a screw <b>99</b>, as shown in FIG. 26. A the time of mounting the attachment member <b>85</b> onto the picking blade <b>84</b>, the protrusion <b>842</b> is inserted between the two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a </i>of the elastic nipping member <b>100</b>, and at that time, two protrusions <b>842</b> are symmetrically provided in the longitudinal direction of the picking blade <b>84</b> as described above, so there is no problem in the event that the picking blade <b>84</b> itself is attached backwards in the longitudinal direction. Next, push switches <b>86</b> are attached to the two attachment holes <b>85</b> <i>b </i>provided to the attachment member <b>85</b>, a substrate <b>87</b> is mounted thereupon, and the whole is fixed with screws <b>95</b>. FIG. 27 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the elastic nipping member <b>100</b> following fixing thereof.</p>
    <p>Also, regarding the portion of the push switches <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>, the following is carried out. First, as shown in FIG. <b>24</b> and FIG. 28, the push switches <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> are attached to the openings <b>80</b> <i>c </i>and <b>80</b> <i>d </i>of the main body <b>80</b>A, and switch elements <b>89</b> <i>a </i>and <b>89</b> <i>b </i>are attached thereupon, following which a substrate <b>88</b> is provided over the same and is fixed by screws <b>96</b>.</p>
    <p>Also, regarding the portions other than the above, i.e., the protective member <b>94</b> for protecting the cord <b>87</b> <i>a </i>electrically connected with the substrate <b>87</b>, and the strap attaching members <b>92</b> and <b>93</b> for attaching a strap to the mimic guitar <b>80</b> for hanging on the shoulder, these are attached to recesses formed around the main body <b>80</b>A.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, with a mimic guitar <b>80</b> manufactured by such a process, the picking blade <b>84</b> is easily supported by the elastic nipping member <b>100</b> simply by inserting the protrusion <b>842</b> between two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a</i>, and also subsequent member attachment is performed unrelated to the supported state of the picking blade <b>84</b>, so assembly can be carried out easier than mimic guitars of a configuration which uses a coil spring for the picking unit <b>83</b>.</p>
    <p>Incidentally, with the mimic guitar <b>80</b>, an elastic nipping member <b>100</b> having a general shape of a box with one side open is used, but the present invention is not restricted to this. For example, an elastic nipping member consisting only of two nipping portions <b>100</b> <i>a</i>, or an elastic nipping member <b>100</b> having only the portion which nips the protrusion <b>842</b> formed so as to have the general shape of a box and the linking portion situated therebetween formed as a plate of elastic material, may be used.</p>
    <p>As described above, the rhythm game apparatus is comprised of: a rhythm sound data storage device for storing a plurality of selective sound types (or groups) and a series of rhythm sounds in each selective type or group; a display device for displaying image data concerning occurrences of sounds in each sound group with time passing; a sound generation device; an instrumental unit integrally comprising an sound group selector for selecting a sound group and an instructor for instructing generation of a sound in the sound group selected by the sound group selector to the sound generation device; a judging means for judging whether or not the sound selected by the sound group selector is instructed by the instructor within a predetermined time; a sound generation controller for generating at least background sound to the sound generation device; and an evaluator for comparing the operating timing of the instructor and the timing of the displayed instruction, and for evaluating the instruction operation based on a total of differences therebetween.</p>
    <p>Also, the rhythm game production method comprises the steps of: displaying a plurality of selective sound types or groups and a sequence of rhythm sounds in each type (or group) with time passing, allowing the game player to instruct generation of a sound in a selected sound group; and judging whether or not the sound is instructed within a predetermined time; comparing the instruction timing and the predetermined sound generation timing; and evaluating the instruction operation based on a total of differences therebetween.</p>
    <p>The computer-readable storage medium stores the program comprising the steps of displaying a plurality of selective sound types (or groups) and a sequence of rhythm sounds in each type or group with time passing, allowing the game player to instruct generation of a sound in a selected sound group; and judging whether or not the sound is instructed within a predetermined time; comparing the instruction timing and the predetermined sound generation timing; and evaluating the instruction operation based on a total of differences therebetween.</p>
    <p>The sound generation control is performed by the sound group selection and the generation instruction, so a rhythm-matching game can be enjoyed relatively easily in a manner closer to real playing of an instrument. Also, operation evaluation can be performed for players who have operated only by listening to background music.</p>
    <p>In other words, the inventive rhythm game apparatus performs a rhythm-matching game with sound generation input by operation of the player. Accordingly, there are provided rhythm selecting means of selecting and instructing a correct sound with respect to a played music piece; and a rhythm input instrumental unit having an instruction means for instructing generation of the rhythm sound; a first storage device (PCM data storing unit <b>12</b>) for storing sound generation data for each sound in the played music piece; second storage device (main RAM <b>13</b>) for storing the sound generation data for each sound in the played music piece and the true generation timing data thereof, and also storing score points data according to the degree of matching of these, and also storing programs stipulating the sound generation control procedures and rhythm input operating evaluating procedures; sound generation controller for following the sound generation control procedures to read out the aforementioned sound generation data according to the input of the generation signals from the aforementioned rhythm input instrumental unit so as to perform control of one sound generation of the played music piece; and an instruction operation evaluator for following the rhythm input operating evaluating procedures to compare the instruction timing of the aforementioned instruction means and the true generation timing data, and evaluating the instruction operation for score points data corresponding to the degree of matching thereof, so as to add score points. The second storage means stores notes display control procedures; and also comprising a monitor capable of displaying images; graphic storage means for storing notes screen data of the instruction operation for visually guiding the instruction operation with the rhythm input instrumental unit; and a display device for updating the notes screen data following the notes display control procedures in a manner corresponding to the time-system group of the played music piece, and performing display control on the monitor so as to display whether or not there has been a miss in operation with the rhythm input instrumental unit.</p>
    <p>The inventive rhythm game method performs rhythm-matching with sound generation input by operation of the player, and comprises the steps of: outputting a notes display screen to the display means for visually guiding the instruction operation with the instrumental unit; obtaining the degree of matching between the instruction timing of a sound in the selected sound group and the true instruction timing; outputting closer sound data according to this degree of matching to sound generation device; and evaluating instruction operation for score points data corresponding to this degree of matching and adding the score points.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the computer-readable storage medium stores a program capable of executing the steps of: performing rhythm-matching with sound generation input by operation of the player: outputting a notes display screen for visually guiding the instruction operation with the instrumental unit; obtaining the degree of matching between the instruction timing and the true generation time; outputting closer sound data according to this degree of matching to sound generation device; and evaluating instruction operation for score points data corresponding to this degree of matching and adding the score points.</p>
    <p>According to these configurations, the sound generation control and instruction operation evaluation may be performed by the sound group selection and the generation instruction. Accordingly, a rhythm-matching game can be enjoyed relatively easily in a manner closer to real playing of an instrument. Also, when conducting this rhythm game, the changing sound group selection and the generation instruction timing may be displayed on the monitor. Thus, the rhythm-matching game can be performed in an easier manner, such that the rhythm-matching game can be played for even relatively difficult pieces.</p>
    <p>Also, another aspect of the present invention, there are provided a rhythm sound data storage device for correlating identification symbols to each sound data of a played musical piece including at least rhythm sound, and for storing the same; a display means; a display device for sequentially displaying on the display means a plurality of identification marks indicating the identification symbols corresponding with each piece of sound data comprising the played musical piece, and also for instructing the operating timing corresponding to each identification mark being displayed; a sound generation device; an instrumental unit integrally comprising an sound group selector having a selection portion equivalent to the type of the identification mark for selectively instructing an identification mark corresponding to the sound data of the rhythm sound data storage device and an instructor for instructing the generation of the sound corresponding to the identification mark selected by the sound group selector to the sound generation device; a judging means for judging whether or not the sound data selected by the sound group selector is instructed as operating timing within the certain interval by the instructor; a sound generation controller for generating at least background sound to the sound generation device; and an evaluator for comparing the operating timing of the instructor as to the sound data instructed as the operating timing and the timing of the operating timing display instruction, and for evaluating the instruction operation from the difference amount thereof.</p>
    <p>Also, the sound generation controller may be made to output sound data instructed as the operating timing to the sound generation device so as to generate sound, at the point that the sound generation instructing member is operated in a state that the judging means has affirmed, at the operating timing of the user. Further, as described above, the sound generation controller may be made to output sound data instructed as the operating timing to the sound generation device so as to generate sound, at each certain point in a state that the judging means has affirmed, such that sound is generated at each certain point by the sound generation controller. In this case as well, the same advantages of the above aspect of the present invention are exhibited.</p>
    <p>The evaluator may evaluate based on the total difference amount obtained by accumulating the difference amount to each piece of sound data. Further, as described above the evaluator may set a tolerance range before and after the operating timing for each sound data, and calculate score by accumulating addition parameters set according to the smallness of the amount of being off within the inner side of the boundary of the tolerance range as a reference thereof, and subtraction parameters set according to the greatness of the amount of being off at the outer side thereof. Though this arrangement is such wherein the higher the score is, the higher the skill is deemed to be, but an arrangement may be made wherein the higher the score is, the lower the skill is deemed to be.</p>
    <p>According to these configurations, the sound generation control and instruction operation evaluation is performed by the sound group selection and the generation instruction, so not only can evaluation be made by listening to the sounds produced by the player himself/herself or others, accurate evaluation can be made with evaluation standards, so particularly two can play and compete based on the evaluation standards, enabling the rhythm-matching game to be even more fair and enjoyable.</p>
    <p>Further, as described above, the sound data may contain at least either of scales or chords. According to this configuration, the sounds generated by sound generation instruction have a rich variety, and the rhythm-matching game can be further enjoyed.</p>
    <p>The display device may comprise: a graphic storage device for storing notes screen data for visually guiding the instruction operation by the instrumental unit; and a graphic controller sequentially updating the notes screen data according to the group of the time-system of the played music piece, and also for displaying whether or not there has been a miss in the input operation by the instrumental unit. According to the above configuration, sound generation instruction is performed with the notes screen as a guide, so the rhythm-matching game can be easily played for even relatively difficult played music pieces. Also, misses in the input operation are displayed on the notes screen in real-time, so the player can identify and immediately correct his/her mistake in real-time, thereby allowing the rhythm-matching game to be enjoyed at an even higher level.</p>
    <p>Regarding the instrumental unit, one of the input means for the right hand of the player and the input means for the left hand of the player may comprise the sound group selector, and the other comprise the instructor. Also, as described above, regarding the instrumental device, one of the input means for the right hand of the player and the input means for the left hand may comprise the sound group selector, and the other comprise the sound generation instructing member.</p>
    <p>According to this configuration, the rhythm-matching game can be played using the right hand and left hand in a manner closer to reality.</p>
    <p>The instrumental unit may have a form mimicking that of a guitar, the sound group selector configured of a plurality of neck buttons corresponding to the series of rhythm sound types, and the instructor configured of one picking unit. Also, the instrumental device described above may have a form mimicking that of a guitar, wherein the sound group selector is configured of a plurality of neck buttons corresponding to the series of rhythm sound types, and the instructor is configured of one picking unit.</p>
    <p>According to this configuration, the rhythm game apparatus according to the present invention can be easily applied to playing with a mimic guitar.</p>
    <p>The picking unit may comprise: a picking blade provided swingably; a restoring mechanism for restoring a blade portion of the picking blade to a reference position with respect to the instrumental unit; and a swing detector for detecting the swing of the picking blade to determine a sound generation timing.</p>
    <p>According to this configuration, the picking unit can be obtained wherein a simpler configuration can be used to obtain a realistic feel close to that of picking a mimic guitar, and more precise instruction timing can be made.</p>
    <p>It may be appreciated to provide a pair of elastic members below the picking blade. One member of the pair is provided on one swing side while the other member is provided on the other swing side. It may be, also, appreciated that the picking blade is formed with a protrusion extending inside, and the restoring mechanism includes an elastic support holding the protrusion in a swingable manner. Also, as described above, the picking blade may be provided swingably with respect to the instrumental unit and also have a protrusion protruding from the inner plane thereof toward the inner side of the instrumental unit, and the restoring mechanism have an elastic nipping member for nipping the protrusion from both sides of the swinging direction of the picking blade and also support the picking blade in a swingable manner; and the picking blade is supported at the reference position by elastic nipping pieces by inserting the protrusion in the portion for nipping the protrusion of the elastic nipping member.</p>
    <p>In the case a configuration described above, by inserting the protrusion of the picking blade into the portion of the elastic nipping member for nipping the protrusion, the picking blade is supported thereby, so the picking blade can be easily attached, and ease of attaching the picking blade can be improved over the case of another above-described arrangement. Particularly in the case of the invention described in the previous paragraph, by inserting the protrusion of the picking blade into the portion of the elastic nipping member for nipping the protrusion, the picking blade is supported in the reference position, which is even more preferable.</p>
    <p>Further, the sound generation controller may be provided with: a difference amount detector for detecting a difference between the sound generation length of the sound data according to the sound generation instruction from the instrumental unit and the time range of generating sound of the sound data; and sound generation control means for outputting to the sound generation device the sound data of the side containing more sound generation length of sound data according to the sound generation instruction, in the time range for generating sound of continuing sound data. According to the above configuration, outputting sound generation based on the degree of matching of the sound group selection and the instruction timing makes for a less unnatural sound generation corresponding with the playing.</p>
    <p>Further, the rhythm input operating evaluator may perform adding of scored points in the event that the position of the instrumental unit is changed at a certain period in the played music piece. According to this configuration, changing the way of holding the rhythm input instrumental unit with the sensation of a live performance, such as raising along with the music in the case of a mimic guitar for example, allows the rhythm-matching game to be enjoyed more.</p>
    <p>The sound generation control and instruction operation evaluation are performed by the sound group selection and the instruction timing. Accordingly, a rhythm-matching game can be enjoyed relatively easily in a manner closer to a realistic state of playing an instrument.</p>
    <p>The sound generation control and instruction operation evaluation is performed by the sound group selection and the instruction timing, so not only can evaluation be made by listening to the sounds produced by the player himself/herself or others, accurate evaluation can be made with evaluation standards, so particularly two can play and compete based on the evaluation standards, enabling the rhythm-matching game to be even more fair and enjoyable.</p>
