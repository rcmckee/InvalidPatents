The block top surface has one or more protrusions positioned adjacent the first and second insets on the block top surface. The block also has a protrusion which has an angled side wall, the angle being at least about 20° from vertical. The protrusion is positioned on the block so that it will mate with any opening of an adjacently positioned course. In use, the blocks may be stacked to provide an interlocking structure wherein the protrusions of one block interfit or mate within the insets of another block.</div>

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The invention generally relates to concrete masonry blocks. More specifically, the invention relates to concrete masonry blocks which are useful in forming various retaining structures.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Soil retention, protection of natural and artificial structures, and increased land use are only a few reasons which motivate the use of landscape structures. For example, soil is often preserved on a hillside by maintaining the foliage across that plain. Root systems from the trees, shrubs, grass, and other naturally occurring plant life, work to hold the soil in place against the forces of wind and water. However, when reliance on natural mechanisms is not possible or practical, man often resorts to the use of artificial mechanisms such as retaining walls.</p>
    <p>In constructing retaining walls, many different materials may be used depending on the given application. If a retaining wall is intended to be used to support the construction of a roadway, a steel wall or a concrete and steel wall may be appropriate. However, if the retaining wall is intended to landscape and conserve soil around a residential or commercial structure, a material may be used which compliments the architectural style of the structure such as wood timbers or concrete block.</p>
    <p>Of all these materials, concrete block has received wide and popular acceptance for use in the construction of retaining walls and the like. Blocks used for these purposes include those disclosed by Forsberg, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,802,320 and Design 296,007, among others.</p>
    <p>Previously, blocks have been designed to “setback” at an angle to counter the pressure of the soil behind the wall. Setback is generally considered the distance in which one course of a wall extends beyond the front surface of the next highest course of the same wall. Given blocks of the same proportion, setback may also be regarded as the distance which the back surface of a higher course of blocks extends backwards in relation to the back surface of a lower course of the wall.</p>
    <p>There is often a need in the development of structures such as roadways, abutments and bridges to provide maximum usable land and a clear definition of property lines. Such definition is often not possible through use of a composite masonry block which results in a setback wall. For example, a wall which sets back by its very nature will cross a property line and may also preclude maximization of usable land in the upper or subjacent property. As a result, a substantially vertical wall is more appropriate and desirable.</p>
    <p>However, in such instances, vertical walls may be generally held in place through the use of mechanisms such as pins, deadheads, tie backs or other anchoring mechanisms to maintain the vertical profile of the wall. Besides being complex, anchoring mechanisms such as pin systems often rely on only one strand or section of support tether which, if broken, may completely compromise the structural integrity of the wall. Reliance on such complex fixtures often discourages the use of retaining wall systems by the everyday homeowner. Commercial landscapers may also avoid complex retaining wall systems as the time and expense involved in constructing these systems is not supportable given the price at which landscaping services are sold.</p>
    <p>Further, retaining structures are often considered desirable in areas which require vertical wall but are not susceptible to any number of anchoring matrices or mechanisms. For example, in the construction of a retaining wall adjacent a building or other structure, it may not be possible to provide anchoring mechanisms such as a matrix web, deadheads or tie backs far enough into the retained earth to actually support the wall. Without a retaining mechanism such as a matrix web, tie-back, or dead head, many blocks may not offer the high mass per face square foot necessary for use in retaining structures which have a substantially vertical profile.</p>
    <p>Manufacturing processes may also present impediments to structures of adequate integrity and strength. Providing blocks which do not require elaborate pin Systems or other secondary retaining and aligning means and are still suitable for constructing structures of optimal strength is often difficult. Various measures must be taken depending upon the nature and position of the detail point on the block that is being made. Further, a balance between manufacturing ease and block performance.</p>
    <p>Two examples of block molding systems are disclosed in commonly assigned Woolford et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,610 and Woolford, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/828,031 filed Jan. 30, 1992 which are incorporated herein by reference. In both systems, advanced design and engineering is used to provide blocks of optimal strength and, in turn, structures of optimal strength, without the requirement of other secondary systems such as pins and the like. The Woolford et al patent discloses a mold which, through varying fill capacities provides for the uniform application of pressure across the fill. The Woolford application discloses a means of forming block features through the application of heat to various portions of the fill.</p>
    <p>As can be seen there is a need for a composite masonry block which is stackable to form walls of high structural integrity without the use of complex pin and connection systems and without the need for securing mechanisms such as pins, or tie backs.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a pinless composite masonry block having a high unit mass per front surface square foot. The block comprises a front surface, a back surface, first and second sides, as well as a top surface and a bottom surface. The block sidewalls each may comprise an opening or inset extending from the top surface to the bottom surface. The block also comprises a protrusion which is positioned, on either the top or bottom surface, so that it may mate with openings on adjacently positioned blocks. In use, the block may be made to form vertical or set back walls without pins or other securing mechanisms as a result of the high mass per front surface square foot.</p>
    <p>In accordance with an additional aspect of the invention there is provided structures resulting from the blocks of the invention. In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is provided a mold and method of use resulting in the block of the invention.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>Turning to the figures wherein like parts are designated with like numerals throughout several views, there is shown a composite masonry block in FIG. <b>1</b>. The block generally comprises a front surface <b>12</b> and a back surface <b>18</b> adjoined by first and second side surfaces <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively, as well as a top surface <b>10</b> and a bottom surface <b>8</b> each lying adjacent said front <b>12</b>, back <b>18</b>, and first <b>14</b> and second <b>16</b> side surfaces. Each of said side surfaces has an inset, <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B, spanning from the block top surface <b>10</b> to the block bottom surface <b>8</b>. The block top surface <b>10</b> may also comprise one or more protrusions <b>26</b>. Each protrusion is preferably positioned adjacent an inset <b>22</b>A or <b>22</b>B, on the block top surface <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The block generally comprises first and second legs <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B, respectively. The first leg <b>24</b>A extends from the block first side <b>14</b>. The second leg <b>24</b>B extends from the block second side <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>The composite masonry block of the invention generally comprises a block body. The block body <b>5</b> functions to retain earth without the use of secondary mechanisms such as pins, dead heads, webs and the like. Preferably, the block body provides a retaining structure which may be manually positioned by laborers while also providing a high relative mass per square foot of face or front surface presented in the wall. To this end, the block may generally comprise a six-surface article.</p>
    <p>The most apparent surface of the block is generally the front surface <b>12</b> which provides an ornamental or decorative look to the retaining structure, FIGS. 1-3. The front surface of the block may be flat, rough, split, convex, concave, or radial. Any number of designs may be introduced into the front surface. Two preferred front surfaces may be seen in FIGS. 1-3 and <b>4</b>-<b>6</b>. Additionally, two alternative embodiments of the block of the invention may be seen in FIGS. 9-11, and two additional alternative embodiments of the invention may be seen at FIGS. 13 and 14. The block of the invention may comprise a flat or planar front surface or a roughened front surface <b>12</b> created by splitting a portion of material from the front of the block, FIGS. 1-3.</p>
    <p>In accordance with one other embodiment of the invention, the block may comprise a split or faceted front surface having three sides, FIGS. 4-6.</p>
    <p>The block of the invention generally also comprises two side surfaces <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, FIGS. 1-6. These side surfaces assist in definition of the block shape as well as in the stacked alignment of the block. Generally, the block of the invention may comprise side surfaces which take any number of forms including flat or planar side surfaces, angled side surfaces, or curved side surfaces. The side surfaces may also be notched, grooved, or otherwise patterned to accept any desired means for further aligning or securing the block during placement.</p>
    <p>One preferred design for the side surfaces may be seen in FIGS. 1-6. As can be seen, the side surfaces <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are angled so as to define a block which has a greater width at the front surface <b>12</b> than at the back surface <b>18</b>. Generally, the angle of the side surfaces (See FIGS. 3 and 6) in relationship to the back surface as represented by alpha degrees, may range from about 70° to 90°, with an angle of about 75° to 85°, being preferred.</p>
    <p>The side surfaces may also comprise insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B for use in receiving other means which secure and align the blocks during placement. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the insets may extend from the block top surface <b>10</b> to the block bottom surface <b>8</b>. The insets in one preferred embodiment are defined by front walls <b>22</b>C and <b>22</b>D, back walls <b>22</b>E and <b>22</b>F, and walls <b>22</b>G and <b>22</b>H interconnecting the front and back walls. Further, these insets may be angled across the height of the block to provide a structure which gradually sets back over the height of the wall. When mated with protrusions <b>26</b>, the insets may also be angled to provide a retaining wall which is substantially vertical.</p>
    <p>The angle and size of the insets may be varied in accordance with the invention. However, the area of the inset adjacent the block bottom surface <b>8</b> should be approximately the same area as, or only slightly larger than, protrusion <b>26</b> with which it will mate. The area of the insets adjacent the block top surface <b>10</b> is preferably larger than the protrusion <b>26</b> by a factor of 5% or more and preferably about 1% to 2% or more. This will allow for adequate movement in the interfitting of blocks in any structure as well as allowing blocks of higher subsequent courses to setback slightly in the retaining structure. Further, by varying the size and position of the inset relative to protrusion <b>26</b>, the set back of the wall may be varied. In effect, the protrusion <b>26</b> may be positioned in any location on the block which facilitates interlocking or mating with an adjacently positioned block. Further, by varying the position of the protrusion within an inset of greater relative size the set back of a retaining structure may be varied in the structure. For example, by pulling the blocks forward as far as possible a setback may be attained in the wall. The set back may vary depending upon any number of factors including protrusion size, core area, and the position of either of these two features on the block, among other factors. A set back of 0″ to 2″, is preferably ¼″to ¾″, and most preferably ½″ has been generally found to work in designing retaining structures. Hereagain, movement forward and backward is the movement of protrusion <b>26</b> within the confines of insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B.</p>
    <p>Generally, the top <b>10</b> and bottom <b>8</b> surfaces of the block function similarly to the side surfaces of the block. The top <b>10</b> and bottom <b>8</b> surfaces of the block serve to define the structure of the block as well as assisting in the aligned positioning of the block in any given retaining structure. To this end, the top and bottom surfaces of the block are generally flat or planar surfaces.</p>
    <p>Preferably, as can be seen in FIGS. 1-6, <b>9</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>13</b>-<b>16</b>, either the top or bottom surface comprises a protrusion <b>26</b>. The protrusion functions in concert with the insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B to secure the blocks in place when positioned in series or together on a retaining structure by aligning the protrusions <b>26</b> within the given insets. To this end, the protrusions <b>26</b> may be positioned anywhere on the block which will facilitate the mating of the protrusions <b>26</b> with insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B. While the protrusions may take any number of shapes, they preferably have a kidney or dogbone shape.</p>
    <p>As can be seen in FIGS. 1-6, FIGS. 9-11, and FIGS. 13-14, the protrusion may comprise two circular or oblong sections which are joined across their middle by a narrower section of the same height. The central narrow portion in the protrusion <b>26</b> (FIGS. 1-6) allows for orientation of the blocks to provide inner curving and outer curving walls by the aligned seating and the relative rotation of the protrusion <b>26</b> within, and in relationship to, any block inset <b>22</b>A or <b>22</b>B. In turn, the larger surface area of the dogbone naturally gives this protrusion greater strength against forces which otherwise could create movement among individual wall blocks or fracture of this element of the block.</p>
    <p>Generally, the protrusions may comprise formed nodules or bars having a height ranging from about ¼ inch to 1 inch, and preferably about ½ inch to ⅝ inch. The width or diameter of the protrusions may range from about 1 inch to 3 inches, and preferably about 1-½ inches to 2-½ inches. In shipping, the protrusions may be protected by stacking the blocks in inverted fashion, thereby nesting the protrusions within opening <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>Generally, the protrusions <b>26</b> and insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B may be used with any number of other means which function to assist in securing the retaining wall against fill. Such devices include tie backs, deadheads, as well as web matrices such as GEOGRID™ available from Mirafi Corp. or GEOMET™ available from Amoco.</p>
    <p>The back surface <b>18</b> of the block generally functions in defining the shape of the block, aligning the block as an element of any retaining structure, as well as retaining earth or fill. To this end, the back surface of the block may take any shape consistent with these functions.</p>
    <p>Various embodiments of the block back surface can be seen in FIGS. 1-6, <b>9</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>13</b>-<b>14</b>. In accordance with the invention, the back surface may preferably be planar and have surfaces <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B which extend beyond the side surfaces of the block. In order to make the block more portable and easily handled, the block may be molded with any number of openings including central opening <b>30</b>. This central opening <b>30</b> in the block allows for a reduction of weight during molding. Further, these openings allow for the block to be filled with earth or other product such as stone, gravel, rock, and the like which allows for an increase in the effective mass of the block per square foot of front surface. One or more openings may also be formed in the front portion of the blocks as can be seen by openings <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, FIGS. 9-11. Additional fill may be introduced into openings <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>36</b> as well as the openings formed between surfaces <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B and adjacent side walls <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>In use, a series of blocks are preferably placed adjacent each other, forming a series of fillable cavities. Each block preferably has a central cavity <b>30</b> for filling as well as a second cavity formed between any two adjacently positioned blocks. This second cavity is formed by opposing side walls <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, and adjacently positioned back surfaces <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B. This second cavity, formed in the retaining structure by the two adjacent blocks, holds fill and further increases the mass or actual density of any given block structure per square foot of front surface area. The block cavity <b>30</b> may preferably also provide an opening for a protrusion from an adjacently positioned block with which to mate.</p>
    <p>Generally, an unfilled block (FIGS. 1, <b>4</b> and <b>13</b>), may weigh from about 95 to 155 pounds, preferably from about 100 to 125 pounds per square foot of front surface. Once filled, the block mass will vary depending upon the fill used but preferably the block may retain a mass of about 140 to 180 pounds, and preferably about 150 to 175 pounds per square foot of front surface when using rock fill such as gravel or class <b>5</b> road base.</p>
    <p>Two alternative preferred embodiments of the invention can be seen in FIGS. 9-11. First, as can be seen in FIG. 9, there is depicted a block having cavities <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> for accepting fill. Further, this block also has sidewall insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B and a protrusion for complimentary stacking with the blocks shown in FIGS. 1-6, FIGS. 10-11, or FIGS. 13-14. Consistent with the other embodiments of the block disclosed herein, this block allows for finishing walls having base courses of larger heavier blocks with blocks which are smaller, lighter and easier to stack on the higher or highest courses. While not required, the block depicted in FIGS. 1-6, <b>10</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>13</b> may be larger in dimension than the block of FIG. 9 from the front surface to back surface allowing for the construction of a structure such as that shown in FIG. <b>12</b>. Further, the use of the dogbone shaped protrusion <b>26</b> allows for retention of these blocks in an interlocking fashion with the blocks of lower courses to form a wall of high structural integrity, (see FIG. <b>12</b>).</p>
    <p>The blocks depicted in FIGS. 9 and 14 may weigh from about 60 to 100 pounds, preferably from about 75 to 95 pounds, and most preferably from about 80 to 90 pounds, with the filled block mass varying from about 90 to 130 pounds, preferably from about 95 to 125 pounds, and most preferably from about 105 to 115 pounds per square foot of front surface using rock fill such as gravel or class <b>5</b> road base.</p>
    <p>Another alternative embodiment of the block of the invention can be seen in FIGS. 10, <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>. As can be seen, the block depicted in FIGS. 10, <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> has angled first and second legs <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B, respectively, as well as an angled back wall sections, <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>A, and <b>18</b>B.</p>
    <p>The resulting back surfaces <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B, (FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>), have a reduced angle alpha which increases the structural integrity of the wall by increasing the walls resistance to blow out. The angled back surfaces <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B provide a natural static force which resist the pressure exerted by the angle of repose of fill on any given retaining structure. The angled back surfaces <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B may be anchored in fill placed between adjacent blocks. Any force attempting to move this block forward, will have to also confront the resistance created by the forward angled back legs moving into adjacently positioned fill or, if the base course, the ground beneath the wall.</p>
    <p>The use of angled back walls also facilitates manufacture of the blocks of the invention. Specifically, the angled back sides <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B assist in allowing the conveying of blocks once they have been compressed, formed, and cured. Generally, the proximity of the blocks on the conveyer may lead to physical contact. If this contact occurs at a high speed, the blocks may be physically damaged. Also, the use of a conveyer which turns on curves in the course of transporting may naturally lead to contact between blocks and damage. Angling the back side legs <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B allows easier and more versatile conveyer transport and strengthens the back side legs.</p>
    <p>Angling the back sides of the block also assists in the formation of a cell when two blocks are placed adjacent to each other in the same plane. This cell may be used to contain any assortment of fill including gravel, sand, or even concrete. The design of the block of the invention allows the staggered or offset positioning of blocks when building a retaining wall structure. The internal opening <b>30</b> of the blocks depicted in FIGS. 1-6, <b>10</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>13</b> may be used in conjunction with the cells created by the adjacent blocks to create a network of channels for the deposition of fill. Specifically, with the offset placement blocks from one course to the next, the opening <b>30</b> of a second course block may be placed over a cell created by two blocks positioned adjacent each other in the first course. Thus, opening <b>30</b> in second course block is aligned with a cell in the next lower course and this cell may be filled by introducing gravel, sand, etc. into the opening in the second course block. The addition of further courses allows the formation of a series of vertical channels across the retaining structure, (see FIG. <b>7</b>).</p>
    <p>From the axis created by back wall <b>18</b>, the back legs <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B may angle towards the front surface of the block ranging from about 5 degrees to 20 degrees, preferably about 7 degrees to 15 degrees, and most preferably about 10 degrees to 12 degrees, (FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>). The angle beta (FIG. 11) may generally range from about 60 to 80 degrees, preferably about 60 to 75 degrees, and most preferably about 65 to 70 degrees. Further, this block (FIGS. 10 and 11) may vary in weight from about 100 to 150 pounds, preferably about 110 to 140 pounds, and most preferably from about 115 to 125 pounds, with the filled block mass varying from about 210 to 265 pounds, preferably from about 220 to 255 pounds, and most preferably from about 225 to 240 pounds per square foot of front surface using rock fill such as gravel or class <b>5</b> road base.</p>
    <p>A further alternative embodiment of the invention may be seen in FIGS. 13-16. When constructing structures such as those seen in FIGS. 7 and 8, as well as FIG. 12, (for example a retaining wall), several concerns may arise depending upon the dimensions of the block, length and height of the structure, environmental conditions including the nature of the fill used behind the wall as well as the environment in which the wall is placed including landscape geography, weather, etc. Additionally, depending upon the block manufacturing process used, certain concerns with the dimensions of the block as well as the various protrusions, openings, and associated block features, may also be raised.</p>
    <p>Specifically, when constructing the landscape structure such as that shown in FIG. 8, the structure is generally assembled one course at a time while the appropriate fill is placed behind the wall. Once complete, the pressure on the wall will tend to force blocks of each subsequently higher course outward towards the front of the wall. The interlocking nature of the protrusion <b>26</b> and insets, <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B, will generally resist the movement between the blocks of any two given courses.</p>
    <p>The structural integrity of a composite masonry block structure generally comes from the coefficient of friction between the blocks of adjacent courses, the footprint of the blocks used in the structure, as well as the nature of the protrusion <b>26</b>. Generally, the protrusion functions to secure the block on which it is placed or the blocks of the next adjacent course by interfitting with insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B. By using a protrusion having angled sidewalls, the tendency for blocks to push forward out from the wall due to physical stresses is substantially reduced. Further, we have also found that by using a protrusion having sidewalls of varying angles, manufacturing may be streamlined and efficiency increased.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 13 and 14 depicts composite masonry blocks which are similar in design to those shown in FIGS. 9-11. These blocks comprise openings <b>30</b> and <b>35</b> as well as a front face <b>12</b> which may be faceted (see FIG. 13 with dotted lines depicting surfaces <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B), or unfaceted, as surface <b>12</b> (see also FIG. <b>13</b>).</p>
    <p>As will be seen, the mold used in accordance with the invention may provide for various break point <b>19</b>, in the various surfaces of the block. These break points may be used, for example, to remove block legs <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B, or define front faceted surfaces <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>′. These blocks provide insets, <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B, as well as, a protrusion <b>26</b> which may span a portion of the upper surface of the block and may boarder the insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B.</p>
    <p>The blocks of FIGS. 13 and 14 may also comprise a tag <b>35</b>′. Tag <b>35</b>′ functions to provide any observer with a perception of a more complete and solid view when the blocks of the invention are used to make outer curing walls. Use of tag <b>35</b>′ tends to cover any opening which may occur as the blocks are angled to a greater degree and higher courses do not cover opening <b>35</b> completely.</p>
    <p>Generally, as can be seen in FIGS. 13 and 14, the protrusion can have four sides. The angle on each of these four sides may vary in accordance with the invention to provide for a more secure placement of blocks as well as ease in processing. Side <b>26</b>A may generally be found adjacent opening <b>35</b>. Protrusion side <b>26</b>B may generally be found adjacent opening <b>30</b>. In turn, sides <b>26</b>C generally may be found adjacent insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B.</p>
    <p>With the understanding that the block of the invention may be used in any number of structural configurations, an additional view of the protrusion of the invention may be seen in FIG. 15 in accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention. As can be seen, protrusion <b>26</b> generally has visible three sidewalls, <b>26</b>A and <b>26</b>B which are adjoined by <b>26</b>C, in this view. In this instance, protrusion <b>26</b> sidewall <b>26</b>B is a position towards the block back <b>18</b> and is angled so as to provide an adequate stopping or nesting mechanism to prevent any block, placed immediately adjacent it, from moving forward when stacked in an interlocking form, i.e. by interlocking the protrusion of one block with the insets of an immediately adjacent second block.</p>
    <p>Further, by changing the incline of protrusion surface <b>26</b>A so as to lessen the angle between the upper surface <b>10</b> of the block and protrusion surface <b>26</b>A (or away from vertical), the protrusion may be formed more easily during block molding. Reducing the angle of surface <b>26</b>A from vertical allows the application and release of the heated stripper shoe in a manner which lowers the potential for retaining fill within the heated stripper shoe indentation, (see FIG. 17A at <b>79</b>). Hereagain, the positioning of protrusion surfaces <b>26</b>A and <b>26</b>B may depend upon how the block is to be used, with protrusion surface <b>26</b>B positioned to resist the forward movement of subsequent courses of blocks and surface <b>26</b>A positioned to facilitate manufacture of the block but not compromise the structural integrity of, for example, the resulting wall.</p>
    <p>An enlarged cross-sectional view of protrusion <b>26</b> can be seen in FIG. <b>16</b>. Protrusion surface <b>26</b>B generally has an angle delta in relationship to vertical as shown by axis x-x′. Protrusion surface <b>26</b>A also has an angle theta in relationship to vertical as shown by access z-z′. Angle delta generally provides the greatest resistance towards displacement of a block on an adjacent course. Further, in order to ease manufacture, protrusion surface <b>26</b>A will generally have an angle theta which allows ease of manufacture which prevents fill from adhering from the underside of the heated stripper shoe.</p>
    <p>As can be seen in FIGS. 13 and 14, the protrusion <b>26</b> may have a straight front surface, and symmetrical opposing bulb-shaped side portions. The back surface <b>26</b>B of the protrusion may comprise an indentation <b>27</b> which allows for the angled orientation of blocks of preceding or subsequently layed courses. As with all other embodiments of the protrusion, the side walls are angled to ease manufacture and avoid displacement between blocks of various courses. The angles theta and delta are preferably both at least about 20°, or greater, when measured from vertical (with horizontal measured as an angle 90° from vertical). More preferably, angles delta and theta vary from about 19° to 21° from vertical, and most preferably, angles delta and theta are about 20° from vertical. Use of an angle for both theta and delta of at least this magnitude allows optimal efficiency in manufacture while retaining the greatest structural integrity. In this context, protrusion side walls <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B, and <b>26</b>C, all have substantially the same angle.</p>
    <p>Hereagain, as one of skill in the art will realize from reading this application, the orientation of protrusion surfaces <b>26</b>A and <b>26</b>B may vary depending upon the structure of the block in the manner in which the block is used in, in overall landscape structure.</p>
    <p>In use, protrusion <b>26</b> may span from inset <b>22</b>A to inset <b>22</b>B across a portion of the top or bottom surface of the block. Generally, and according to this aspect of the invention, as shown in FIGS. 13-16 the protrusion will have a height ranging from one-quarter inch to three-quarter inches and preferably from about three-eighth inches to one-half inches. The overall width of the protrusion from surface <b>26</b>A to <b>26</b>B will generally range from about 1 inch to 4 inches, preferably about 2 to 3 inches, and most preferably about 2 and ½ inches between protrusion surface <b>26</b>A and <b>26</b>B. Hereagain, one of skill in the art will understand, having read this specification, how these ranges may be changed or otherwise altered, but still within the scope of the invention.</p>
    <p>While all of the blocks depicted herein may be made in varying scales, the following table provides general guidelines on size.</p>

    <heading>Block Structures</heading> <p>The composite masonry block <b>5</b> of the invention may be used to build any number of landscape structures. Examples of the structures which may be constructed with the block of the present invention are seen in FIGS. 7-8. As can be seen in FIG. 7, the composite masonry block of the invention may be used to build a retaining wall <b>10</b> using individual courses or rows of blocks to construct a wall to any desired height.</p>
    <p>Generally, construction of a structure such as a retaining wall <b>10</b> may be undertaken by first defining a trench area beneath the plane of the ground in which to deposit the first course of blocks. Once defined, the trench is partially refilled and tamped or flattened. The first course of blocks is then laid into the trench. Successive courses of blocks are then stacked on top of preceding courses while backfilling the wall with soil.</p>
    <p>The blocks of the present invention also allow for the production of serpentine walls. The blocks may be placed at an angle in relationship to one another so as to provide a serpentine pattern having convex and concave surfaces. If the desired structure is to be inwardly curving, blocks of the invention may be positioned adjacent each other by reducing either surface <b>28</b>A or <b>28</b>B on one or both blocks. Such a reduction may be completed by striking leg <b>24</b>A or <b>24</b>B with a chisel adjacent deflection <b>19</b>, see FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b>. Deflection <b>19</b> is preferably positioned on the block back surface <b>18</b> to allow reduction of the appropriate back surface leg (<b>24</b>A or <b>24</b>B) while retaining enough potential open area for filling between blocks. Structures made from composite masonry blocks are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,610, issued Nov. 5, 1991 to Woolford et al which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>While designed for use without supporting devices, a supporting matrix may be used to anchor the blocks in the earth fill behind the wall. One advantage of the block of the invention is that despite the absence of pins, the distortion created by the block protrusions <b>26</b> when mated with insets <b>22</b>A or <b>22</b>B anchors the matrix when pressed between two adjacent blocks of different courses.</p>
    <p>Further, the complementary design of the blocks of the invention allow the use of blocks <b>40</b> such as those depicted in FIGS. 1-6, <b>10</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>19</b> with blocks <b>42</b> which are shorter in length in the construction retaining wall structures, (FIG. <b>12</b>). Tie-backs, deadheads, and web matrices may all be used to secure the retaining wall structure <b>46</b> in place. The generally large pound per square-foot front area of the blocks depicted herein allows blocks such as those depicted in FIGS. 1-6, <b>10</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>19</b> to be used in the base courses with blocks such as those depicted in FIG. 9 used in the upper courses. In turn, the design of all the blocks disclosed herein allows the use retaining means such as geometric matrices (i.e., webs), deadheads and tie backs without pins. Such securing means may be useful in anchoring the smaller blocks in place when used, for example, towards the upper portion of the retaining structure.</p>
    <p>The invention also comprises a heated stripper shoe, a heated stripper shoe/mold assembly and a method of forming concrete masonry blocks with the shoe and mold assembly.</p>
    <p>The stripper shoe and mold assembly generally includes those elements disclosed in earlier incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,610, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,249,950, issued Oct. 5, 1993 to Woolford, which are both incorporated herein by reference. As can be seen in FIGS. 17A and 17B there is provided a stripper shoe plate <b>70</b>, having a lower side <b>75</b> and an upper side <b>77</b>, FIG. <b>17</b>A. The stripper shoe plate <b>70</b> may have indentations to form block details such as those shown at <b>79</b> on the shoe lower side <b>75</b>, (see also <b>26</b> at FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b>). Heat elements may be positioned on the stripper shoe plate upper side <b>77</b> within a heat shroud <b>80</b>. The stripper shoe plate may comprise any number of pieces to allow for manufacture using core elements <b>62</b>A, and <b>62</b>B, for example. Openings <b>76</b>A through <b>76</b>D define points of separation for the shoe plate pieces or elements.</p>
    <p>Positioned over the heat elements on the upper surface of the shoe plate is a heat shroud <b>80</b>. The heat shroud lower side is configured to cover the heat elements. Once the heat shroud <b>80</b> is positioned over the upper surface <b>77</b> of the stripper shoe plate <b>70</b>, wiring for the heat elements may be passed through the heat shroud <b>80</b> and further into the head assembly <b>90</b>.</p>
    <p>The assembly may also comprise a standoff <b>90</b> which attaches the assembly to the block machine head <b>95</b>. The standoff <b>90</b> is capable of spacing the stripper shoe plate <b>70</b> appropriately in the block machine and insulating the head from the heat developed at the surface of the stripper shoe plate <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p>The assembly also comprises a mold <b>50</b> having an interior perimeter designed to complement the outer perimeter of the stripper shoe plate <b>70</b>, FIG. <b>17</b>B. The mold generally has an open center <b>63</b> bordered by the mold walls.</p>
    <p>Positioned beneath the mold is a pallet (not shown) used to contain the concrete fill in the mold and transport finished blocks from the molding machine.</p>
    <p>The stripper shoe <b>70</b> serves as a substrate on which the heat elements <b>78</b> are contained. Further, the stripper shoe plate <b>70</b> also functions to form the body of the block as well as detail in the blocks through indentations <b>79</b> in the stripper shoe lower surface <b>75</b>. In use, the stripper shoe <b>70</b> functions to compress fill positioned in the mold and, once formed, push or strip the block from the mold <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>The stripper shoe plate <b>70</b> may take any number of designs or forms including ornamentation or structural features consistent with the block to be formed within the mold. Any number of steel alloys may be used in fabrication of the stripper shoe as long as these steel alloys have sufficient resilience and hardness to resist abrasives often used in concrete fill. Preferably, the stripper shoe <b>70</b> is made from steel alloys which will resist continued compression and maintain machine tolerances while also transmitting heat from the heat elements through the plate <b>70</b> to the fill. In this manner, the total thermal effect of the heat elements is realized within the concrete mix.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the stripper shoe plate <b>70</b> is made from a carbonized steel which may further be heat treated after forging. Preferred metals include steel alloys having a Rockwell “C”-Scale rating from about 60-65 which provide optimal wear resistance and the preferred rigidity. Generally, metals also found useful include high grade carbon steel of 41-40 AISI (high nickel content, prehardened steel), carbon steel 40-50 (having added nickel) and the like. A preferred material includes carbon steel having a structural ASTM of A36. Preferred steels also include A513 or A500 tubing, ASTM <b>42</b>-<b>40</b> (prehardened on a Rockwell C Scale to 20 thousandths of an inch). The stripper shoe plate <b>70</b> may be formed and attached to the head assembly by any number of processes known to those of skill in the art including the nut, washer, and bolt mechanisms known to those of skill in the art.</p>
    <p>One preferred heated stripper shoe design which complements the block mold is shown in FIG. <b>17</b>A. The stripper shoe comprises a first section <b>72</b>A, a second section <b>74</b>B, and a third section <b>72</b>C. The second section <b>72</b>A has indentations <b>79</b> on the shoe lower side <b>75</b>. A heat element is positioned over indentation <b>79</b>. The outer perimeter of the stripper shoe <b>70</b> may generally complement the interior outline of the mold <b>50</b>. Heat elements are preferably positioned adjacent to indentation <b>79</b> on the shoe lower side <b>75</b> to facilitate the formation of that point of detail created by the indentations <b>79</b> in the stripper shoe <b>70</b>. While generally shown with one form of indentation <b>79</b>, the stripper shoe plate <b>70</b> may be capable of forming any number of designs through indentations in the shoe plate lower surface <b>75</b> with the indentation matching the point of detail, such as protrusion <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>The invention may also comprise one or more heat elements, (not shown). Generally, the heat element functions to generate and transmit radiant energy to the upper surface <b>77</b> of the stripper shoe <b>70</b>. The heat elements are preferably positioned adjacent indentation <b>79</b> in the shoe plate lower surface <b>75</b>.</p>
    <p>Generally, any type and quantity of heat elements may be used in accordance with the invention. However, preferred heat elements have been found to be those which will withstand the heavy vibration, dirt and dust common in this environment. Preferred heat elements are those which are easily introduced and removed from the system. This allows for easy servicing of the stripper shoe assembly without concerns for injury to the operator through thermal exposure or complete disassembly of mold <b>50</b>, stripper shoe <b>70</b>, shroud <b>80</b>, and standoff <b>90</b>.</p>
    <p>The heat element may comprise any number of electrical resistance elements which may be, for example, hard wired, solid state, or semiconductor circuitry, among others. The heat element may generally be positioned over indentations <b>79</b> in the stripper shoe lower surface <b>75</b>, FIG. <b>13</b>A. By this positioning, the heat element <b>78</b> is able to apply heat to the stripper shoe <b>70</b> in the area where it is most needed, that is, where the block detail (in this case, protrusion <b>26</b>, see FIG. 1) is formed in the concrete mix held by the mold.</p>
    <p>The heat element may comprise any number of commercially available elements. Generally, the power provided by the heat element may range anywhere from 300 watts up to that required by the given application. Preferably, the power requirements of the heat element may range from about 400 watts to 1500 watts, more preferably 450 watts to 750 watts, and most preferably about 600 watts. Power may be provided to the heat elements by any number of power sources including for example, 110 volt sources equipped with 20 to 25 amp circuit breakers which allow the assembly to run off of normal residential current. If available, the assembly may also run off of power sources such as 3-phase, 220 volt sources equipped with 50 amp circuit breakers or other power sources known to those of skill in the art. However, the otherwise low power requirements of the assembly allow use in any environment with minimal power supplies. In one system used to make the blocks of the invention, two heating elements, (each 550 volts and a 20 amp breaker) are used to make the block of FIG. <b>13</b>. Four heating elements, (also 550 volts each) are used to make pairs of the block depicted in FIG. <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>Elements found useful in the invention include cartridge heaters, available from Vulcan Electric Company, through distributor such as Granger Industrial Co. of Minnesota. These elements have all been found to provide easy assembly and disassembly in the stripper shoe of the invention as well as good tolerance to vibration, dirt, dust, and other stresses encountered in such an environment.</p>
    <p>Generally, the heat elements may be activated by hard wiring as well as any other variety of electrical feeds known to those of skill in the art. If hard wiring is used, provision may be made to circulate this wiring through the shroud <b>80</b> and standoff <b>90</b> by various openings <b>88</b>. The heat element may be externally controlled through any number of digital or analogue mechanisms known to those of skill in the art located at an external point on the block machine.</p>
    <p>Heating the stripper shoe elements allows the formation of block detail such as indentations or protrusions, or combinations thereof without the fouling of the shoe plate <b>70</b>. Detail is essentially formed by case hardening the concrete fill adjacent the element. This allows the formation of block detail which is both ornate and has a high degree of structural integrity.</p>
    <p>The invention may also comprise means of attaching the heat element to the stripper shoe <b>70</b> such as a heat block. Examples of attachment means for the heat elements <b>76</b> may again be seen in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,249,950, issued Oct. 5, 1993 to Woolford et al and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>The stripper shoe may also comprise a heat shroud <b>80</b> (shown in outline), FIG. 17A, which thermally shields or insulates the heat elements and molding machine. The heat shroud <b>80</b> also functions to focus the heat generated by the heat elements back onto the stripper shoe <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p>The heat shroud <b>80</b> may take any number of shapes of varying size in accordance with the invention. The heat shroud <b>80</b> should preferably contain the heat elements. To this end, the heat shroud <b>80</b> preferably has a void formed within its volume so that it may be placed over the heat elements positioned on the upper surface <b>77</b> of the stripper shoe <b>70</b>. At the same time, the shroud <b>80</b> is preferably positioned flush with the stripper shoe upper surface <b>77</b>.</p>
    <p>Preferably, there is a space between the upper surface of the heat element and the opening or void in the heat shroud <b>80</b>. Air in this additional space also serves to insulate the standoff and mold machine from the heat created by the heat element.</p>
    <p>Generally, the heat shroud <b>80</b> may comprise any metal alloy insulative to heat or which is a poor conductor of thermal energy. Metal alloys such as brass, copper, or composites thereof are all useful in forming the heat shroud <b>80</b>. Also useful are aluminum and its oxides and alloys. Alloys and oxides of aluminum are preferred in the formation of the heat shroud <b>80</b> due to the ready commercial availability of these compounds. Aluminum alloys having an ASTM rating of 6061-T6 and 6063-T52 are generally preferred over elemental aluminum.</p>
    <p>The assembly may additionally comprise a head standoff <b>90</b>, attached to the stripper shoe plate <b>70</b>, to position, aid in compression, and attach the head assembly to the block machine.</p>
    <p>Generally, the head standoff <b>90</b> may comprise any number of designs to assist and serve this purpose. The head standoff may also be used to contain and store various wiring or other elements of the stripper shoe assembly which are not easily housed either on the stripper shoe <b>70</b>, or the heat shroud <b>80</b>.</p>
    <p>The head standoff <b>90</b> may comprise any number of metal alloys which will withstand the environmental stresses of block molded processes. Preferred metals include steel alloys having a Rockwell “C”-Scale rating from about 60-65 which provide optimal wear resistance and the preferred rigidity.</p>
    <p>Generally, metals found useful in the manufacture of the head standoff mold of the present invention include high grade carbon steel of 41-40 AISI (high nickel content, prehardened steel), carbon steel <b>40</b>-<b>50</b> (having added nickel) and the like. Another material includes carbon steel having a structural ASTM of A36. Generally, the head standoff <b>50</b> may be made through any number of mechanisms known to those of skill in the art.</p>
    <p>The assembly may also comprise a mold <b>50</b>. The mold generally functions to facilitate the formation of the blocks. Accordingly, the mold may comprise any material which will withstand the pressure to be applied to the block filled by the head. Metal such as steel alloys having a Rockwell “C”-Scale rating from about 60-65 which provide wear resistance and rigidity. Generally, other metals found useful in the manufacture of the mold of the present invention include high grade carbon steel of 41-40 AISI (high nickel content, prehardened steel), carbon steel 40-50 (having added nickel) and the like. Another material useful in this context includes carbon steel having a structural ASTM of A36. Useful materials may also include materials which have been treated or coated to increase hardness with any variety of materials.</p>
    <p>Mold <b>50</b> useful in the invention may take any number of shapes depending on the shape of the block to be formed and be made by any number of means known to those of skill in the art. Generally, the mold is produced by cutting the steel stock, patterning the cut steel, providing an initial weld to the pattern mold pieces and heat treating the mold. Heat treating generally may take place at temperatures ranging from about 1000° F. to about 1400° F. from 4 to 10 hours depending on the ability of the steel to withstand processing and not distort or warp. After heat treating, final welds are then applied to the pieces of the mold.</p>
    <p>Turning to the individual elements of the mold, the mold walls generally function according to their form by withstanding the pressure created by the block machine. Further, the walls measure the height and the depth of resulting blocks. The mold walls must be made of a thickness which will accommodate the processing parameters of the block formation given a specific mold composition.</p>
    <p>Generally, as can be seen in FIG. 17B, the mold comprises a front surface <b>52</b>, back surface <b>54</b>, as well as a first side surface <b>51</b>, and a second side surface <b>58</b>. As noted, each of these surfaces function to hold fill within a contained area during compression, thus resulting in the formation of a block. Accordingly, each of these mold surfaces may take a shape consistent with this function.</p>
    <p>The mold side walls, <b>51</b> and <b>58</b>, may also take any shape in accordance with the function of the mold. Preferably, the side walls each comprise an extension <b>64</b> which are useful in forming the insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B in the block of the invention, see FIG. <b>1</b>. In order to form insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B in the block of the invention, extension <b>64</b> may have a dimension which is fairly regular over the depth of the mold.</p>
    <p>However, if insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B are required which have a conical shape as seen in FIGS. 2 and 5, the extensions may be formed to have a width at the top of the mold which is greater than the width of the extension at the bottom of the mold. This will result in the insets <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B which are seen in the various embodiments of the block of the invention shown in FIGS. 1-6, <b>9</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>13</b>-<b>16</b> while also allowing stripping of the block from the mold <b>50</b> during processing.</p>
    <p>The mold may preferably also comprise one or more support bars <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>C and core forms <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>B. The support bars <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>C hold the core forms <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>B in place within the mold cavity <b>63</b>. Here again, the support bars may take any shape, size, or material composition which provides for these functions.</p>
    <p>As can be seen more clearly in FIG. 17B, support bars <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>C are preferably long enough to span the width of the mold <b>50</b> resting on opposing side walls <b>51</b> and <b>59</b>. The support bars <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>C functions to hold cores <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>B within the mold central opening <b>63</b>. Complementing this function, the support bars <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>C are generally positioned in the central area <b>63</b>B of the opposing side walls <b>51</b> and <b>58</b>. In turn, core form <b>62</b>A may be held in place by support bar <b>60</b>A and positioned generally in the central area <b>63</b>A between the opposing sidewalls <b>51</b> and <b>58</b>. The support bars <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>C may be held in place by a mold top plate <b>85</b> by inserting support bar end portions, such as for example <b>60</b>A′ into and through the top plate. The use of these various support structures reduces core form vibration during the molding process.</p>
    <p>As can be seen in the outline on FIG. 17B, the core forms <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>B are supported by bars <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>C which span the width of the mold <b>50</b> resting through the mold top plate onto the opposing side walls <b>51</b> and <b>58</b>. The core forms have any number of functions. The core forms <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>B act to form voids in the resulting composite masonry block. In turn, the core forms lighten the blocks, reduce the amount of fill necessary to make a block, and add to the portability and handleability of the blocks to assist in transport and placement of the blocks.</p>
    <p>Also preferred as can be seen in the view provided in FIG. 17B, the core form <b>62</b>A is affixed to the support bar <b>60</b>A. As can be seen, the support bars <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>C projects upwards from mold <b>50</b>. As a result, the stripper shoe <b>70</b> and stand off <b>80</b> may be partitioned or split, (at <b>76</b>A-<b>76</b>D), as can be seen in FIG. <b>17</b>A. The separate sections of the shoe <b>70</b> and stand off will allow adequate compression of the fill without obstruction by the support bars <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>C. In turn, the various sections of the stripper shoe <b>70</b> and stand off <b>90</b> may be held in place by the head <b>95</b>.</p>
    <p>While the mold of the invention may be assembled through any number of means, one manner is that shown in FIG. <b>17</b>B. Preferably, the mold is held in place by two outer beams <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>, each of which have an interior indentation, <b>61</b> and <b>67</b>, respectively. As can be seen, bolt elements <b>57</b> may be fit into the front wall <b>52</b> and back wall <b>54</b> of the mold <b>50</b>. The side walls <b>51</b> and <b>58</b> of the mold may be held in the outer beams of the mold by nut plates <b>65</b> sized to fit in indentations <b>61</b> and <b>67</b>. In turn the nut plates <b>65</b> may be held within the outer beam indentations <b>61</b> by bolt means <b>53</b>. In this manner, the mold <b>50</b> may be held in place even though constructed of a number of pieces. As one of skill in the art will recognize having read this specification any number of extension sections, see for example <b>68</b> in FIG. 17B, may be used in accordance with the insertion. These extensions may be used to create any number of effects, such as, for example break out points in the blocks by flange <b>66</b>. Additionally, the extension units <b>68</b> may be used to create faceting in the front surface <b>12</b> of the block or vary the angle of the block sides <b>14</b> or <b>16</b> in front or behind the cores <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B. Changing the angle of the block sides <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> may be completed to facilitate the molding of a block which is useful in making inner and outer curving retaining structures. The same alteration in shape and surface angle may be effected through mold extension pieces <b>68</b> with any of the blocks of the invention.</p>
    <p>An additional aspect of the present invention is the process for casting or forming the composite masonry blocks of this invention using a masonry block mold assembly, FIGS. 13A and 13B. Generally, the process for making this invention includes block molding the composite masonry block by filling a block mold with mix and casting the block by compressing the mix in the mold through the application of pressure to the exposed mix at the open upper end of the block mold. An outline of the process can be seen in the flow chart shown in FIG. <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>In operation, the assembly is generally positioned in the block molding machine atop of a removable or slidable pallet (not shown). The mold so is then loaded with block mix or fill. As configured in FIGS. 17A and 17B, the mold <b>50</b> is set to form one block. Once formed and cured, these blocks may be split along the deflections created by flanges <b>66</b> which may be positioned on the interior of sidewalls of the mold. Prior to compression, the upper surface of the mold is vibrated to settle the fill and scraped or raked with the feed box drawer (not shown) to remove any excess fill. The mold is then subjected to compression directly by the stripper shoe <b>70</b> through head assembly.</p>
    <p>Upon compression, the stripper shoe <b>70</b> forces block fill towards either end of the mold and into the stripper shoe indentation <b>79</b> to create a protrusion <b>26</b> in the formed block, see FIG. <b>1</b>. This indentation may range in size for example from about 1 to 3 inches, preferably about 1½ to 2½ inches, and most preferably about 1¾ to 2 inches.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the invention, this indentation <b>79</b> is heated by elements so that protrusions <b>26</b> of minimal size and varying shape may be formed without the build up of fill on the stripper shoe <b>70</b> at indentation <b>79</b>. By doing so, the assembly may be used in the automatic manufacture of blocks by machine.</p>
    <p>Blocks may be designed around any number of different physical properties in accordance with ASTM Standards depending upon the ultimate application for the block. For example, the fill may comprise from 75 to 95% aggregate being sand and gravel in varying ratios depending upon the physical characteristics which the finished block is intended to exhibit. The fill generally also comprises some type of cement at a concentration ranging from 5% to 15%. Other constituents may then be added to the fill at various trace levels in order to provide blocks having the intended physical characteristics.</p>
    <p>Generally, the fill or mix may be formulated in any variety of ways with any variety of constituents as known to those of skill in the art. In one exemplary manner, fill constituents may be mixed by combining the aggregate, the sand and rock in the mixer followed by the cement. After one to two and one-half minutes, any plasticizers that will be used are added. Water is then introduced into the fill in pulses over a one to two minute period. The concentration of water in the mix may be monitored electrically by noting the electrical resistance of the mix at various times during the process. While the amount of water may vary from one fill formulation to another fill formulation, it generally ranges from about 1% to about 6%.</p>
    <p>Once the mold has been filled, leveled by means such as a feed box drawer, and agitated, a compression mechanism such as a head carrying the assembly converges on the exposed surface of the fill. Levelling may be completed by means such as a strike off bar (not shown) which removes excess fill before molding through a screeding action across the top of the mold from side to side. The strike off bar may allow for the design of mold and any detail to be created in the resulting block. For example, the strike off bar may be notched to allow for support bars <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>C or may be patterned to allow for the deposition or more fill in the area of the mold in which the block protrusion <b>26</b> (for example) is formed. The stripper shoe assembly <b>30</b> acts to compress the fill within the mold for a period of time sufficient to form a solid contiguous product. Generally, the compression time may be anywhere from 0.5 to 4 seconds and more preferably about 1.5 to 2 seconds. The compression pressure applied to the head ranges from about 1000 to about 8000 psi and preferably is about 4000 psi.</p>
    <p>Once the compression period is over, the stripper shoe <b>70</b> in combination with the underlying pallet acts to strip the blocks from the mold <b>50</b>. At this point in time the blocks are formed. Any block machine known to those of skill in the art may be used in accordance with the invention. One machine which has been found useful in the formation of blocks is a Besser V-{fraction (3/12)} block machine.</p>
    <p>Generally, during or prior to compression the mold may be vibrated. The fill is transported from the mixer to a hopper which then fills the mold <b>50</b>. The mold is then agitated for up to 2 to 3 seconds, the time necessary to ensure the fill has uniformly spread throughout the mold. The blocks are then formed by compressive action by the compressive action the head. Additionally, this vibrating may occur in concert with the compressive action of the head onto the fill in the mold. At this time, the mold will be vibrated for the time in which the head is compressed onto the fill.</p>
    <p>Once the blocks are formed, they may be cured through any means known to those with skill in the art. Curing mechanisms such as simple air curing, autoclaving, steam curing or mist curing, are all useful methods of curing the block of the present invention. Air curing simply entails placing the blocks in an environment where they will be cured by open air over time. Autoclaving entails placing the blocks in a pressurized chamber at an elevated temperature for a certain period of time. The pressure in the chamber is then increased by creating a steady mist in the chamber. After curing is complete, the pressure is released from the chamber which in turns draws the moisture from the blocks.</p>
    <p>Another means for curing blocks is by steam. The chamber temperature may be slowly increased over time and then stabilized after the block has reached an equilibrium temperature and moisture content given the curing environment humidity and temperature. The steam is turned off and allowed to cool. In most instances, the blocks are generally allowed to sit for a period of time to promote structural integrity and strength before being stacked or stored. Critical to curing operations is a slow increase in temperature. If the temperature is increased too quickly, the blocks may “case-harden”. Case hardening occurs when the outer shell of the block hardens and cures while the inner region of the block remains uncured and moist. While any of these curing mechanisms will work, the preferred mechanism is autoclaving.</p>
    <p>Once cured the blocks may be split to create any number of functional or aesthetic features in the blocks. Splitting means which may be used in the invention include manual chisel and hammer as well as machines known to those with skill in the art. Flanges <b>66</b> (FIG. 9) may be positioned on the interior of the mold <b>50</b> side walls to provide a natural weak point or fault which facilitates the splitting action. The blocks may be split in a manner which provides a front surface <b>12</b> which is smooth or coarse (FIGS. 1-6 and FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b>), single faceted (FIG. 1) or multifaceted (FIG. <b>4</b>), as well as planar or curved. For example, the blocks may be split to provide a faceted front surface as shown in FIGS. 4-6 by surfaces <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>, and <b>12</b>B. Preferably, splitting will be completed by an automatic hydraulic splitter. When split, the blocks may be cubed and stored. Once split, the blocks may be cubed and stored.</p>
    <p>The above discussion, examples, and embodiments illustrate our current understanding of the invention. However, since many variations of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the invention resides wholly in the claims hereafter appended.</p>
