The spreadsheet program comprises three storage areas: a spreadsheet data structure; a set of database files in a storage area, and a video display system. The spreadsheet data structure is divided into two sets of cells that can be operated through three different environments. The first environment contains the tools of a spreadsheet environment, and the first set of cells can be operated through the first environment. This is most appropriate for scratchpad uses. The second environment contains the tools of a spreadsheet environment and contains a special command that can define commands for the third environment. This is appropriate to develop formulas for an application, and the application&#39;s environment of operation. The second environment also contains the tools necessary to define special environments for the integrated operation of spreadsheet and database tools. Said integrated operation coordinates dynamic screen video operations of the information in the spreadsheet and database storage areas. The second set of cells (for the development and use of an application) can be operated through the second or third environments.

The spreadsheet program comprises three storage areas: a spreadsheet data structure; a set of database files in a storage area, and a video display system. The spreadsheet data structure is divided into two sets of cells that can be operated through three different environments. The first environment contains the tools of a spreadsheet environment, and the first set of cells can be operated through the first environment. This is most appropriate for scratchpad uses. The second environment contains the tools of a spreadsheet environment and contains a special command that can define commands for the third environment. This is appropriate to develop formulas for an application, and the application's environment of operation. The second environment also contains the tools necessary to define special environments for the integrated operation of spreadsheet and database tools. Said integrated operation coordinates dynamic screen video operations of the information in the spreadsheet and database storage areas. The second set of cells (for the development and use of an application) can be operated through the second or third environments. Several environments for the integrated operation of spreadsheet and database tools can exist in this invention. The software enables users to develop and use full database applications such as integrated accounting packages, within spreadsheet environments.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The invention relates to the field of enhancements for spreadsheet software instruments. More specifically the invention relates to an improved environment and data interface for spreadsheet and database instruments.</p>
    <p>Heretofore three kinds of instruments had been involved with a similar idea as that dealt with in the invention: multitasking environments (A), database systems (B) and database tools for spreadsheet instruments (C).</p>
    <p>A. Referring to MULTITASKING ENVIRONMENTS, the DESKVIEW™ multitasking environment, by Quarterdeck Office Systems, and the MICROSOFT WINDOWS™ graphical user interface and multitasking environment, by Microsoft Corporation, allow applications such as spreadsheets and database programs to transfer information from one to another by data exchange services. But this communication between processes is slow and limited to information displayed in the video screen.</p>
    <p>B. Referring to relational DATABASE SYSTEMS, some of these let the user build entry tables that are similar in appearance to spreadsheet tables. The FOXBASE+™ and the FOXPRO™ programmable database file managers, by Fox Software Inc., call them browse tables. There are also other systems, such as the ADVANCED REVELATION™ programmable database file manager, by Revelation Technologies Inc., that let the user write small programs to perform field calculations that involve formulas and numerical operations. The LOTUS/DBMS™ spreadsheet/database integrative program, by Lotus Development Corporation, is one such relational database systems. A publication in the LOTUS™ industry-specific magazine, by Lotus Development Corporation, April 1988, page 5, says that the LOTUS/DBMS™ spreadsheet/database integrative program, by Lotus Development Corporation, "will share a common menu structure and programming capability with Lotus Development's forthcoming graphical spreadsheet" (referring to the LOTUS 1-2-3/G™ spreadsheet program, by Lotus Development Corporation). "This means, for example, that (the user) will be able to move data between the database and the spreadsheet without reformatting or converting." "[Besides] An add-in product will allow you to use LOTUS 1-2-3™ Releases 2 and 3 with the LOTUS/DBMS™ server. This will enable users of Microsoft's DOS 3.0™ operating system and OS/2™ operating system to share information, using the familiar LOTUS 1-2-3™ interface."</p>
    <p>However, browse tables of relational database systems are not spreadsheet tables. In a browse table the user may define a formula and place its computed results in a field that is added to all the records. Thus, the same formula is repeatedly applied to all records. Except for the ADVANCED REVELATION™ programmable database file manager, by Revelation Technologies Inc., the formula's arguments may only be fields of the same record that holds the result of the calculation.</p>
    <p>Most relational database instruments provide procedural languages for the development of applications. These languages allow the user to perform calculations with diverse structures, and write the results back to fields located anywhere in the records. But the combination of the procedural language and the data interface for indexed files causes the programming and interpretation of calculations to be cumbersome.</p>
    <p>The LOTUS/DBMS™ spreadsheet/database integrative program, by Lotus Development Corporation, is an example of a standalone relational database instrument that operates as described above. Compatibility with the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program, by Lotus Development Corporation, is limited to menu structure and programming language. The LOTUS/DBMS™ spreadsheet/database integrative program, by Lotus Development Corporation, has offered an add-in product that allows the use of LOTUS 1-2-3 RELEASE 2.0™ and LOTUS 1-2-3 RELEASE 3.0™ with the LOTUS/DBMS™ spreadsheet/database integrative program, by Lotus Development Corporation. But it is very probable that this new product operates like all database add-ins for the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program, by Lotus Development Corporation. Database add-ins are very similar to the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Personics Corporation, a database tool for a spreadsheet program described in the following section.</p>
    <p>C. The ideas used by DATABASE TOOLS FOR SPREADSHEET PROGRAMS are the most similar prior-art references to the invention.</p>
    <p>The @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Personics Corporation, may be considered the pioneer among the LOTUS 1-2-3™ add-in product family. It has kept a leadership position in the market and a series of enhanced versions have updated its capabilities.</p>
    <p>The @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management is a database add-in for the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program that mimics most commands in the DBASE III™ database file manager, by Ashton Tate Corporation. The manufacturer refers to it as "a full-feature relational database add-in for LOTUS 1-2-3™." Personics advertises the product with the slogan: "@BASE™ turns LOTUS 1-2-3™ into a powerful front-end for database applications."</p>
    <p>In the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management it is possible to set up dynamic links that import updated information from the DBASE III™ database file manager records every time a worksheet is recalculated. Records can be entered or examined either in a form view, where each record occupies a separate screen, or in the usual one-record-to-a-line format.</p>
    <p>Besides the indexing feature, the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management's OPTION PAC™, by Personics Corporation, can perform file join operations to create relational databases and operating computed fields. Also it may sort a database without rearranging the records on the disk, and automatically keeps files in the correct sorting order during record entry or updating.</p>
    <p>The @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management comprises two sets of elements in its operational structure: a functional replicate of the DBASE III™ database file manager's set of commands, and a set of @functions for read and write operations.</p>
    <p>Any DBASE III™-compatible command may be issued from within the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program, by Lotus Development Corporation. But the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management and the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program have completely independent video screens and communication links between files and data. Thus, operating the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management's independent compatible format files is functionally equivalent to suspending execution of the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program, and activating the DBASE III™ database file manager. The user may go back to the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program when finished using the DBASE III™ tools. This clears the video overlay of the add-in application, and allows the user to return to the LOTUS 1-2-3™'s previous condition.</p>
    <p>A set of @functions allow the user to read and write the contents of single fields in database files and single cells in the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet environment. These functions perform like standard screen input and output operations in the DBASE III™ database file manager. Yet database and spreadsheet instruments operate independently from one another.</p>
    <p>With the invention, the user can generate coordinated video operations, to look and operate simultaneously at a combination of the spreadsheet and the database files contents. This is not possible in the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management.</p>
    <p>By means of the invention, the user needs only design the structure and contents of database files and spreadsheet formulas. The screen simultaneously displays actual spreadsheet information and a dynamic database browse view. Yet, the program performs all read and write functions automatically, so the user is unaware of them. Thus, it is necessary for the user to distinguish between the database and the spreadsheet data.</p>
    <p>In the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, the user has to program each individual read and write operation to and from the database files. These operations and functions may be directly written in data cells or as the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program's macro commands. Yet an average programmer would consider this an extensive and complicated programming task. The execution of these operations would be significantly slow, due to the large number of commands and to a sub-optimal execution schedule for read and write operations.</p>
    <p>The ORACLE DATABASE ADD-IN FOR 1-2-3™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Oracle Systems Corp., is a product whose basic concept is similar to the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management. However, this product also allows the user to type SQL statements directly into the worksheet. These statements can be stored in LOTUS 1-2-3™ worksheet cells as LOTUS 1-2-3™ @functions. Function @SQL(range) executes the SQL statement in "range." These SQL statements may operate directly with database tables.</p>
    <p>However, video operations in the environments of LOTUS 1-2-3™ and the ORACLE DATABASE ADD-IN FOR 1-2-3™ spreadsheet add-in are totally isolated, as in the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management. With the invention, the user can generate coordinated video operations, to look and operate simultaneously at a combination of the spreadsheet and the database files contents, as was described before.</p>
    <p>SQL statements accelerate programming for the operation of database files, but they cannot control those read and write operations that effect information transfer between spreadsheet and database instruments. Users of the ORACLE DATABASE ADD-IN FOR 1-2-3™ spreadsheet add-in would have to do extensive programming automatic read/write operations in the invention. Therefore, the same limitations described for the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Personics Corporation, apply to this product.</p>
    <p>The INFORMIX DATASHEET ADD-IN™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Informix Software Inc., develops essentially the same idea and data procedures as the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Personics Corporation, but is based in a different database file format. It uses "query by example" techniques. There are other important implementations of database add-in spreadsheet tools, such as @DB123™ , which are not described here. These present similar characteristics and limitations as those products described here.</p>
    <p>As mentioned in preceding paragraphs, the invention presents a spreadsheet environment optimally suited for the integrated operation of database files. Such an environment cannot be developed using an add-in product such as any of those described here. This type of product is designed with a different orientation. It provides the user expanded spreadsheet operations, by adding @functions and superimposing alternative menus and video structures in particular modes of the spreadsheet environment. These capabilities in an existent spreadsheet product do not suffice for the implementation of the invention.</p>
    <p>Recent spreadsheet programs, like the MICROSOFT EXCEL™ spreadsheet program, by Microsoft Corporation, the SUPERCALC™ spreadsheet program, by Computer Associates International Inc., and the LOTUS 1-2-3 release 2.2™ and the LOTUS 1-2-3 release 3.1™ spreadsheet programs, by Lotus Development Corporation, also contain database features. As an example of their characteristics, four products will be discussed here: the QUATTRO PRO™ spreadsheet program, by Borland International, the VP-PLANNER PLUS™ spreadsheet program, by Paperback Software International, the LOTUS SYMPHONY™ integrated spreadsheet/database manager/word processing program, by Lotus Development Corporation, and the UNIPLEX SPREADSHEET™ program by Uniplex Information Systems.</p>
    <p>The QUATTRO PRO™ spreadsheet program, by Borland International, is a spreadsheet program that implements database instruments similar to those described in the previous add-in database instruments. The same limitations described for the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Personics Corporation, apply to this product. Also, this product does not allow the user to write information directly to a database file. Besides, the user may read data from a database file, but needs to convert it to a spreadsheet format to operate on it.</p>
    <p>The VP-PLANNER PLUS™ spreadsheet program, by Paperback Software International, is a spreadsheet program that implements the read, write, query and sort operations of the previous database instruments. This product also implements a multidimensional database option, which lets the user create a database with up to five fields. By choosing two of these fields to act as vertical and horizontal coordinates, the user can view a crosstab table automatically. However, this multidimensional database file is really a spreadsheet data storage file of a fixed format. Thus, the same limitations described for the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Personics Corporation, apply to this product.</p>
    <p>The LOTUS SYMPHONY™ integrated spreadsheet/database manager/word processing program, by Lotus Development Corporation, integrates spreadsheet, database and word processing environments. Yet this product stores database information in spreadsheet cells. So, the nature of its query, sort and other database operations is very similar to operations in LOTUS 1-2-3™ and other spreadsheet programs. The same limitations described for the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Personics Corporation, apply to this product.</p>
    <p>The UNIPLEX SPREADSHEET™ program by Uniplex Information Systems, is a spreadsheet program based in the UNIX™ operating system, by AT&amp;T. It supports "embedded calls to the database using SQL," according to the commercial documentation. The UNIPLEX SPREADSHEET™ program by Uniplex Information Systems, is part of the UNIPLEX ADVANCED OFFICE SYSTEM™ also by Uniplex Information Systems, integrating several application programs. However, all these products can only exchange information through a compatible format for file storage. Like most integrated software systems, the UNIPLEX SPREADSHEET™ program only allows video integration of independent modules through the window capability of the base operating systems. The same limitations described for the @BASE™ spreadsheet add-in for database management, by Personics Corporation, and for multitasking environments such as the DESKVIEW™ multitasking environment, by Quarterdeck Office Systems, and the MICROSOFT WINDOWS™ graphical user interface and multitasking environment, by Microsoft Corporation, apply to this product.</p>
    <p>Two particular products also merit mention as relevant prior-art references to the invention: (D) the REFLEX PLUS™ spreadsheet analysis tool, by Borland International, and (D) the RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system, by Lord Publishing Inc.</p>
    <p>D. The REFLEX PLUS™ spreadsheet analysis tool, by Borland International, is a database program that adds special features for the analysis of information. The user may define several ways of displaying the data, or database "views."</p>
    <p>For example, one possible "view," called table-mode, can mimic some operations in a spreadsheet program. This corresponds to the "browse" mode in other database programs. It allows the user to examine all the database information as in a spreadsheet table.</p>
    <p>Table-mode operations act only on the structure and contents of a single flat database file. In table-mode, any formula is evaluated on all records of the underlying database. This is functionally equivalent to the operation of computed fields in other database programs. The user interface for the development, modification and recalculation of formulas in table-mode imitates some characteristics of spreadsheet programs.</p>
    <p>The REFLEX PLUS™ spreadsheet analysis tool is a flat database program with a powerful customized interface for data analysis. Yet its functionality is still limited to that of a database program, which naturally lacks the flexibility of spreadsheet operations. Thus the restrictions mentioned for relational databases apply to this program as well.</p>
    <p>E. The RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system, by Lord Publishing Inc., is a software tool for developing financial models (by Lord Publishing, Inc.; One Apple Hill, Natick, Mass. 01760; 508-651-9955).</p>
    <p>The visual operation and the user interface of the RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system are similar to the operation of the invention's database interface. Also, the RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system allows the definition of formulas as in a spreadsheet, but the user is restricted to write them in a single column. This instrument is not a spreadsheet program.</p>
    <p>Formula evaluation in the RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system parallels a Copy command in a spreadsheet, executed over the entire worksheet. The user of the RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system loads a column of formulas and an entire set of database records into memory. The screen displays records as a columns of data. Then the column of formulas operates repeatedly on successive data columns.</p>
    <p>As indicated before the RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system is not a spreadsheet program. Therefore, it lacks the flexibility and efficiency of the spreadsheet operations that the invention allows. It is restricted by the columnar evaluation of formulas.</p>
    <p>The RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system does not allow the operation of external database files, because it operates exclusively on the database file that is loaded completely into memory. The invention, on the other hand, operates directly with database files' contents.</p>
    <p>The RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system was designed exclusively for the calculation of financial projections. Therefore, it is limited to working with data columns that represent single periods in time. The invention, being an enhancement to a spreadsheet instrument, does not have this restriction, since it can be used to develop all kinds of applications.</p>
    <p>F. SPREADSHEET COMPILERS also merit mention as relevant prior-art references. Two examples of these are the BALER™ spreadsheet compiler, by Baler Software Corporation, and the KING JAGUAR™ spreadsheet compiler, by Sheng Laboratories Inc.</p>
    <p>These instruments allow the user to compile or convert a worksheet into a closed (unmodifiable) application. The worksheet may be developed with any spreadsheet program, such as the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program. The result is a standalone program that uses context-sensitive help screens, data validation, special macros, and pull-down menus. These instruments do not allow the modification of formulas after compilation, nor the creation of new formulas. Therefore, the finished application loses the flexibility of the spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>The invention allows the user all the features mentioned above WITHIN an active modifiable spreadsheet. The invention enables the user to continue to work with the spreadsheet, modify formulas and screens, and do additional transformations on the data. Also, all existing spreadsheet compilers do not contain the capability to access external database files.</p>
    <p>The cited PRIOR-ART references are important because the invention provides the benefits of integrating their main characteristics. Like database add-ins, the invention is a spreadsheet enhancement. Yet, it is the only spreadsheet enhancement that implements options for full environment definition and automatic read and write operations between database and spreadsheet structures. The RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system, by Lord Publishing Inc., and the REFLEX PLUS™ spreadsheet analysis tool, by Borland International, store their information in database structures similarly to the invention. Also, the RONSTADT'S FINANCIALS™ financial forecasting system allows formula operation on database structures. Yet, the invention integrates these concepts in spreadsheet instruments. Spreadsheet compilers implement options for full environment definition, but the invention does so while keeping the interactive nature of a full spreadsheet environment.</p>
    <p>Thus, as stated before, the invention allows users to interactively develop new environments to program and use finished applications, and to use database files for the storage of information operated in the spreadsheet program. Prior art references do not implement interactive creation of spreadsheet environments.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, the following paragraphs describe several objects and advantages of the invention.</p>
    <p>The invention expands the power of spreadsheet programs without placing any limitations on their basic operations. All applications developed for spreadsheet environments are a primary subject of the invention. Of particular interest are applications whose data structures benefit from the added support of database files.</p>
    <p>The invention integrates the operation of spreadsheet and database instruments in an environment that provides an "automatic" collaborative scheme. It allows the coordination of video screens, data storage, spreadsheet operations and database features. The combination does not confuse the user by presenting a multitude of options. This gives more flexibility and power to the spreadsheet than all 3-D and "@BASE-like" schemes used in other products.</p>
    <p>The invention enables the user to develop spreadsheet application environments. This will enable users to develop small, practical and modifiable applications for tasks such as the analysis of financial and accounting statements and market reports. Finished applications may provide specific database features. Also, they may have data validation capabilities, context-sensitive help texts and distinctive screen displays.</p>
    <p>The invention's synergistic approach allows users to develop spreadsheet applications traditionally executed with database instruments, such as integrated accounting packages and inventory analysis.</p>
    <p>By using the invention, users can develop small, practical and modifiable applications for the analysis of financial and accounting statements, market demand, and other business problems. These types of applications will benefit from the invention, because they require relational database storage and access techniques, and complex analytical computations.</p>
    <p>For example, a simple financial model can be developed by using only one col<sub>--</sub> prog window and one flat database file. In this application, each record in the database file corresponds to one period. Also, all formulas are developed in the col<sub>--</sub> prog window. The implementation of a large-scale financial model may use separate database files to store credit information, accounting data, market demand analysis, etc. It would take approximately three man-years to implement this model with prior-art tools. In the invention's environment, the development of the model takes between three and six months.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the invention represents cost reductions in the development of many types of large and complicated data-analysis applications. The resulting applications are as flexible as spreadsheet programs, and modifiable by the user.</p>
    <p>Another example is inventory planning. The invention enables the user to design an application containing past history of sales, inventory levels, prices and other criteria for each product and/or product group. The user may easily classify products according to their sales/inventory level indexes. The application allows the user to prepare sales forecasts and recommend new orders for each product and/or product group. This is accomplished by one or more associated database files. Each file may contain, among other data, information regarding individual products, product groups, demand forecasts, and future orders for manufacturing and/or raw materials.</p>
    <p>Another example is a fully integrated accounting system. The invention allows the creation of such a system in a spreadsheet-database environment. The scratchpad section allows the user the additional opportunity of performing spreadsheet operations on data generated by reports. This information is stored in a relational structure of database files associated to several col<sub>--</sub> prog windows.</p>
    <p>Database files being used by the invention may contain special operational codes. These codes can control the operation of specific database fields or spreadsheet cells. In a particular example, operational codes allow the results of a financial application to be calculated and expressed in different currencies. This may be done without changing the formulas in the spreadsheet environment. Thus, operational codes expand the power and flexibility of the invention's programmability.</p>
    <p>The invention has the functionality of the combination of a spreadsheet compiler and a spreadsheet program. A user can develop applications in a spreadsheet format. Then the user may define tools for the application (menu options, help screens, data validation routines, etc.) that enable other users to operate the application.</p>
    <p>The invention overcomes weaknesses that proved the downfall of spreadsheet prepackaged applications. These applications for spreadsheet programs, or "templates," reached their sales peak before the arrival of the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program. According to some experts, their popularity wanned gradually due to their failure to make the spreadsheet program easier to use. (See chapter 3 of: Entrepreneurial Finance--Taking Control of Your Financial Decision Making, by Dr. Robert Ronstadt; Lord Publishing, Natick, Mass., 1988. Also see: Mark Chussil, "Computer-Based Planning: A PC Survival Guide," The Journal of Business Strategy, January/February, 1988, pp. 38-42.)</p>
    <p>Users of the invention are able to interactively modify an application developed using the invention. The user who developed it can limit the number and quality of the modifications available to other users. Thus, any other user can build new routines for any application, that conform to specific needs. These routines involve adding formulas that cannot damage the primitive application.</p>
    <p>The invention can operate as the software equivalent of a hardware parallel processor for several Turing machines. Additionally, some tools of the invention can make it operate more efficiently than a the parallel Turing machines. Any computation or recognition problem for which there is a known informal algorithm can be handled by a Turing machine. Therefore, the invention can handle and solve all sorts of programming problems.</p>
    <p>Templates developed for spreadsheet programs do not execute as efficiently as other programming means currently available. However, spreadsheet programming is now popular due to the interactive nature of its operation. Also, at a medium range of time, faster mass-memory devices will be available. Then, multidimensional database structures coupled with spreadsheet program tools will make the invention more attractive. Execution of applications programmed with the invention will be more efficient.</p>
    <p>This combination of concepts is an important ramification of the long-term application of the invention. During the next ten years, a large portion of software development and research will focus on the creation of tools for power-easy programming and the easy use of applications. Hardware storage devices will change. Database files will probably be stored in dynamic memory, bubble memory and other hardware structures. This will result in faster data operations.</p>
    <p>The storage and processing of the three elements of the invention (database structures, spreadsheet structures and video system structures) will be important in terms of their relative structures or topologies. The invention may represent a future direction for research. The user will have more power to develop and operate data structures. Also, the user will be able to control the corresponding three levels of the development process for products, tools and applications.</p>
    <p>Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent in the consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>An enhanced spreadsheet program (a) providing a novel synergistic approach to the combination of spreadsheet and database tools, and (b) enabling users to develop an application environment that can use all resources in the spreadsheet storage area.</p>
    <p>The following paragraphs refer to the structure of the invention.</p>
    <p>The enhanced spreadsheet program comprises three storage areas:</p>
    <p>a spreadsheet data structure,</p>
    <p>a set of database files in a storage area, and</p>
    <p>a video display system.</p>
    <p>The spreadsheet data structure is divided into two sets of cells that can be operated through three different environments.</p>
    <p>The first environment contains the tools of a spreadsheet environment, and the first set of cells can be operated through the first environment. This is most appropriate for scratchpad uses.</p>
    <p>The second environment contains the tools of a spreadsheet environment and contains a special command that can define commands for the third environment. This is appropriate to develop formulas for an application, and the application's environment of operation.</p>
    <p>The second environment also contains the tools necessary to define special environments for the integrated operation of spreadsheet and database tools. Said integrated operation coordinates dynamic screen video operations of the information in the spreadsheet and database storage areas.</p>
    <p>The second set of cells (for the development and use of an application) can be operated through the second or third environments.</p>
    <p>The following paragraphs refer to the first enhancement, a novel synergistic approach to the combination of spreadsheet and database tools.</p>
    <p>A novel aspect according to the teachings of the invention is the provision of a browse view in the spreadsheet which shows the contents of a number of different records in the active database file. The spreadsheet has a portion thereof which has previously been defined as a "col<sub>--</sub> prog" range. Cells in this range can receive numbers, text, formulas or any other type of data that may be stored in database record fields. These cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range can be defined as "temporary" or "permanent" by the user at any time. Temporary cells are cells that are designed to receive data updates from database records. Permanent cells are cells that are "write protected" in the sense that when a database record is written into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, the contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range permanent cells are not changed. Whatever field from the database record that would have gone into a permanent cell is not used.</p>
    <p>When contents of a database record are written into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, this database record is then called "active record". The fields of a database record which are designated to be written into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range are defined in the "col<sub>--</sub> prog window". This is a set of instructions that defines which spreadsheet cells are part of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, identifies the name of the database file whose information will be written into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, and defines which fields of the database record exchange data with which fields of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <p>After the contents of a database record have been written into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, the conventional recalculation function key may be pressed and all the formulas in the spreadsheet including the formulas in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range will be recalculated. The formulas in any cell may reference any other cell in the spreadsheet, i.e., read data or the results of formulas from any other cell. Data in the database may thus be brought into a spreadsheet one record at a time and may be operated upon mathematically by whatever formulas are programmed into the cells anywhere on the spreadsheet which reference the cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <p>The "browse view" aspect of the invention allows a screenful of database records to be displayed. The particular record which is "active", i.e., its contents are currently stored in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, is designed in some visual fashion on the display such as by reverse video, a different color, a different color cursor underlining the column, etc. A cursor, which the user can move among all the displayed records, designates a "current" record. When the user desires to load the contents of the "current" database record into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, he or she presses the recalculation function key. This writes the contents of the current database record into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range according to the instructions in the col<sub>--</sub> prog window. The current contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range are written back into the database record from which the original data entered into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range cells at the last recalculation event. In other words, upon each recalculation, the current contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range are used to update the database records from which they originated, and a new database record is loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range and is mathematically operated upon by the formulas in the spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>For time-based database records, the above process is one step in the overall process. Time-based processing works as follows. Assume that the report being developed is a collection report to be run monthly linked to a database on the spreadsheet where monthly database records exist, one field of which is the cash collections for that month. Assume also that one line of the report is total collections year-to-date. To process this report, the cash collections for the current month need to be added to the running total. To do this a "col<sub>--</sub> prev range" is defined in addition to the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. In the preferred embodiment, the program assumes that the database records have been sorted or entered such that records for adjacent periods of time are stored sequentially. In this example, assume that the first database record is January collections, the second record was February collections and the third record was March collections. To process the February record, it would be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range and, the January record would be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prev range. A formula programmed in a cell of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range would then add February collections to the year-to-date collections cell contents in the col<sub>--</sub> prev range (January). When the March record was to be processed, the cursor would be placed on the March record and the recalculation function key would be pressed. This would cause the contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range to be written to the February database record and then the col<sub>--</sub> prog range and the col<sub>--</sub> prev range would be loaded. Col<sub>--</sub> prog is loaded with the contents of the March record and col<sub>--</sub> prev is loaded with the now updated contents of the February database record, and the spreadsheet is recalculated. This causes the contents of the March database record for March collections to be added to the year-to-date collections data stored in the col<sub>--</sub> prev range.</p>
    <p>The "browse view" is a scrolling display and can be used to show all the database records by scrolling through them with the arrow or cursor control keys. When the cursor is moved to the extreme right side of the display, for example, more database records are brought in. Old records for which there is insufficient room scroll off the screen to the left. Database records shown in the browse view may be sorted in different ways, indexed or selected from all database records in a file.</p>
    <p>To summarize this scheme of operation, it can be said that the screen simultaneously displays actual spreadsheet information and a dynamic database browse view. Read and write functions are performed automatically and are transparent to the user. The user does not need to differentiate when he is working with the database files or the spreadsheet data.</p>
    <p>The foregoing description of the communication between database and spreadsheet data corresponds to one environment for the integrated operation of spreadsheet database tools. Several such environments can exist in this invention. The operation of these environments can be coordinated to operate database files in the manner of a relational database system. Thus, said software invention enables users to develop and use full database applications such as integrated accounting packages, within spreadsheet environments.</p>
    <p>The following paragraphs refer to the second enhancement, the development of an application environment that can use all resources in the spreadsheet storage area.</p>
    <p>There are at least three novel aspects to the teachings of the invention regarding provision of a facility whereby a user can develop new applications using the spreadsheet format. An "application" means a spreadsheet or collection of related spreadsheets or portions of the same spreadsheet which are programmed with formulas. These formulas are designed to perform calculations for a particular job such as calculating and displaying an income statement or balance sheet for a particular business enterprise.</p>
    <p>The invention allows the creation of many different tools for the development of new applications using the spreadsheet format. Hence, the three novel aspects described here are only particular examples of the invention's capabilities.</p>
    <p>The first novel aspect is the provision of layout tools by which the user can write his or her own help screens that explain various screens of an application that user has developed. This is called "context sensitive help". For example, assume that the user is developing an income statement report in the range of cells U-5 and Z-200, and assume that the user feels that the particular method by which the user is calculating profits needs to be explained. At any time while the user is entering text, formulas or numbers to the various cells in the report, the user may invoke the help option. The user is then presented with effectively a blank screen which has associated with it a set of basic word processing commands, e.g. a set of commands very similar to the word processing commands of Wordstar™ 3.3. The user may then enter whatever text is necessary to explain any methodology, approach, purpose, function, formula or whatever of the application screen from which the layout-help option was invoked. Alternatively, after a set of reports have been programmed in various ranges of a spreadsheet, the user may write help screens for these reports (or for each screen of the report if the report takes up more than one screen) after they are all done. This is done by invoking the layout-help option and specifying the particular range, i.e., report screen, to which the help screen pertains.</p>
    <p>The second novel aspect is the provision to the user in a spreadsheet environment of a set of layout commands by which the user may program his or her own menus and the "look" of the screen. By these commands, the user can design a set of custom menus and make them appear as menu options anywhere on a screen of his or her design. For example, the user may specify the text of each menu option, whether it appears in the center of the screen in a window, along the top horizontally or down the side vertically etc., the color of the menu box and whether the screen has a border etc. For example, the user may wish to develop a series of portions of the spreadsheet which contain a series of related financial reports regarding the health of a business. Such a series of reports might include an income statement, a balance sheet, a statement of changes in financial position, a sales forecast, a sales by product line and territory, an inventory report and various manufacturing reports. Each of these reports can be contained in a specific range of the spreadsheet and can be assigned to a menu option on a main menu defined by the user using the layout commands. When the user selects a particular report menu option, the portion of the spreadsheet containing that report is brought to the screen for use. The user who designed the formulas contained in the various cells also has the option of "closing" some or all of the formulas so that subsequent users cannot modify them. The subsequent uses may go back and forth from the various reports and the main menu by pushing the escape key.</p>
    <p>A third novel aspect of the invention pertains to "data validation" tools. Although it is known in data base programs to define certain fields as text, numeric, logical, date etc., this concept is unknown in spreadsheets as far as the applicants are aware. Data validation tools are invoked from the layout menu in the layout environment. The user then selects a range by entering the upper left and lower right corners of the range or by pointing to the range corners with a cursor. Then the user presses "enter" and the range is accepted. Upon acceptance, a default set of data validation options for the range appear. The user may then select one of the options such as "text" or "numeric" subsequent users may not enter types of data in the cells so "validated" other than the type of data originally defined for that cell or range by the procedure described above.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading> <p>FIG. 1 represents the symbols to be used throughout FIGS. 1 to 15: RAM storage area (41), disk storage area or other massive storage area for databases (42), and environment (43). An environment defines a set of commands and options available to the user for the operation of information, and displays that information in a particular way.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 represents the invention's structure. This is divided into three storage areas: video system storage area or video<sub>--</sub> sa (48), which contains the information that is displayed in the computer's video screen; database file storage area or db<sub>--</sub> sa (47), which contains information in regular database files; and spreadsheet storage area or spread<sub>--</sub> sa (44), containing information with the same data structures as prior-art spreadsheet programs.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 represents a set of definitions called col<sub>--</sub> prog window (49). This set of definitions may be created by the user. These definitions comprise: the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50) and col<sub>--</sub> prev range (51), which are cells' ranges in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section; the associated case<sub>--</sub> db files (54) and active case<sub>--</sub> db file (52), which are regular database files, and other elements. The case<sub>--</sub> db files are contained in the db<sub>--</sub> sa (47). The col<sub>--</sub> prog range is related to a particular record in the case<sub>--</sub> db file; this is the active record (53). The video display shows the video<sub>--</sub> sa's (48) contents, that is, a browse view of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file, where the active record is substituted by the contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. (The video<sub>--</sub> sa is the video displays's storage area.)</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 shows the database files storage area (42). This contains the case<sub>--</sub> db files (54). One of these files may be the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (52) containing, among other case<sub>--</sub> db records, the active record (53).</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 represents a cell range in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section (46), called col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50). Information of the active record (not shown) can be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 shows that formulas in one section of the spreadsheet (45 or 46) may reference formulas or data in any other section. Referenced formulas or data may or may not be displayed in a particular col<sub>--</sub> prog window. The entire contents of the scratch section (45) and the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section (46), including the information displayed in the col<sub>--</sub> prog windows, are sections of a single spreadsheet. Simple cell formulas connect the data, as in any ordinary spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 shows that all cells in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section (46) can be linked by formulas. The contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50) may thus determine the contents of cells' ranges (56) located anywhere within the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section. The contents of these cells' ranges can be shown in screens defined for the application environment.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 shows that the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50) transfers information to and from the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (52), by reading and writing the information contained in the active record (53).</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 shows that the video storage area (48) contains the screen's information, shown by the video system. It shows a browse view of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (52), where the active record (53) is substituted by the contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50). The current record (57) is the case<sub>--</sub> db record where the screen cursor (58) is positioned. The direction of the arrows indicates the flow of information: the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50) reads information from the active record (53). The video<sub>--</sub> sa (48) receives information from the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (52) and the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50).</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 shows that, while operating in the scratch section (45), control of program execution is in the scratch environment (59).</p>
    <p>FIG. 11 shows that, while operating in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section (46), control of program execution may be in the layout (60) or the application environment (61). The application environment's commands are defined by a special command in the layout environment.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 shows that the active col<sub>--</sub> prog window allows the simultaneous access and operation of information of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (47) and the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50) in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section (46). At this point, control of the program's execution is transferred to the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment (62). The col<sub>--</sub> prog environment inherits all characteristics from the environment in which it is activated. In the example of the figure, the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment was activated from the layout environment (60) and generates the video display (48) as defined.</p>
    <p>FIG. 13 is similar to FIG. 12. But in the example of this Figure, the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment was activated from the application environment (61).</p>
    <p>FIG. 14 shows that the invention can be extended to operate with relational databases. Several col<sub>--</sub> prog windows can be activated simultaneously in a single spreadsheet application. The col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50) in each col<sub>--</sub> prog window accesses its corresponding active case<sub>--</sub> db file (52) and associated case<sub>--</sub> db files (54). Through these operations, and through the coordination of a central program, the col<sub>--</sub> prog windows and the case<sub>--</sub> db files can compose a relational database system.</p>
    <p>FIG. 15 shows that a col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50) can transfer information (63) to and from different records in the assigned case<sub>--</sub> db file (52).</p>
    <p>FIGS. 16A and 16B show the main procedure for the operation of the preferred embodiment. This considers the invention's operation in the scratch, layout and application environments and col<sub>--</sub> prog environment. The following steps are executed: All elements necessary to the operation of the invention are defined (initiate). If the Quit<sub>--</sub> key is pressed, the program terminates, else, it waits for a keypress. According to the key pressed, the program selects a section or does a different action. If section &lt;&gt; Gen<sub>--</sub> Prog, Scratch<sub>--</sub> Environment is executed. If the Environment<sub>--</sub> Key is pressed, an environment is selected. If the Window<sub>--</sub> Key is pressed, the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment and the col<sub>--</sub> prog window are activated or deactivated. If the col<sub>--</sub> prog window is deactivated, the Parent<sub>--</sub> Environment is executed. Finally, if the col<sub>--</sub> prog window is activated, according to the key pressed, the invention may execute any of the following processes: process<sub>--</sub> video, process<sub>--</sub> formula<sub>--</sub> edit, process<sub>--</sub> mark<sub>--</sub> record, process calc, full<sub>--</sub> recalc, change<sub>--</sub> case, field<sub>--</sub> input, or execute<sub>--</sub> parent<sub>--</sub> environment.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17 shows an abbreviated rendering of procedure Main. Same description as in FIG. 16, but the whole operation of the col<sub>--</sub> prog<sub>--</sub> environment is abbreviated in the last process box (col<sub>--</sub> prog environment operation).</p>
    <p>FIG. 18 shows a flowchart of procedure initiate, or the setup of initial conditions. This represents the necessary sequence of operations and commands issued by the user to demonstrate the concepts of the invention relevant to the patent application. The following steps are executed: A section and environment are selected (by default, the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section in the layout environment). Case<sub>--</sub> db files are created. The col<sub>--</sub> prog window is defined. Data cells and permanent cells are defined. Spreadsheet formulas are defined.</p>
    <p>FIG. 19 shows a flowchart of procedure Define<sub>--</sub> Col<sub>--</sub> Prog<sub>--</sub> Window. This procedure represents the operation where a user defines a col<sub>--</sub> prog window. The following steps are executed: The col<sub>--</sub> prog window is named and thus, identified. The following definitions are enacted: col<sub>--</sub> prog range, time<sub>--</sub> based (TRUE or FALSE), col<sub>--</sub> prev range (if time<sub>--</sub> based=TRUE), assigned case<sub>--</sub> db files, the identifiers for each assigned case<sub>--</sub> db file and the identifier for the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (which, in turn, is activated), the active record's identifier.</p>
    <p>FIG. 20 shows a flowchart of procedure Assign<sub>--</sub> Case<sub>--</sub> Dbf. In this procedure, the user assigns Case<sub>--</sub> Db files to the col<sub>--</sub> prog window. Each time this procedure is executed, the next case<sub>--</sub> db file in sequence (according to their identifiers) is selected. The use of `mod` in the second statement guarantees that after the first case<sub>--</sub> db file will again be selected after the last case<sub>--</sub> db file in sequence.</p>
    <p>FIG. 21 shows a flowchart of procedure Select<sub>--</sub> Section. This procedure controls the switching operation between the SCRATCH section and the GEN<sub>--</sub> PROG section.</p>
    <p>FIG. 22 shows a flowchart of procedure Select<sub>--</sub> Environment. This procedure controls the selection of the active environment in the Gen<sub>--</sub> Prog section; that is, the switching operation between the LAYOUT environment and the APPLICATION environment.</p>
    <p>FIG. 23 shows a flowchart of procedure Select<sub>--</sub> Window. By this procedure, it is possible to activate (window:=TRUE) or deactivate (window:=FALSE) a Col<sub>--</sub> Prog window.</p>
    <p>FIG. 24 shows a flowchart of procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Video. This procedure operates and modifies the video display after any cursor key is pressed. Two previous conditions are taken into consideration: the key pressed (any cursor key activates this procedure), and the previous state of the video screen display. All case<sub>--</sub> db records are shown in a browse view, except for the active record, in whose place the col<sub>--</sub> prog range is shown. Data indicators, cursors and video indicators are shown as required.</p>
    <p>FIG. 25 shows a flowchart of procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Formula<sub>--</sub> Edit. This procedure accepts a formula edit operation in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. The following steps are executed: If environment is LAYOUT, then formula<sub>--</sub> edit is accepted and results are marked for storage in the ANS file. Else, formula<sub>--</sub> edit is accepted and results are marked for storage in the CAP file, only if current cell is data cell. Else, formula<sub>--</sub> edit is rejected.</p>
    <p>FIG. 26 shows a flowchart of procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Mark<sub>--</sub> Record. This procedure marks a record as PR (protected), SP (spreadsheet) or DB (database). It acts as a switch between those three values.</p>
    <p>FIG. 27 shows a flowchart of procedure Calc, executing a simple recalc operation. This flowchart shows a simplified case, where Mark<sub>--</sub> Record and Need<sub>--</sub> Rec<sub>--</sub> Calc flags are not considered. The following steps are executed: If the current record is also the active record, then a spreadsheet calc is executed and the process ends. Else, a spreadsheet calc is executed if needed, then the col<sub>--</sub> prog range's contents are written to the active record, the current record's contents are read into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. The current record is then identified as the active record and, if application is time<sub>--</sub> based, the previous<sub>--</sub> record is also loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prev range. Finally, a spreadsheet calc is executed.</p>
    <p>FIG. 28 shows a flowchart of procedure Full<sub>--</sub> Recalc. This executes a full recalculation. The flowchart shows a simplified case. The following steps are executed: If application is not time<sub>--</sub> based, then this process doesn't execute any operations. Else, cursor is positioned at first record (that is, the first record is made the current record). The next record with Mark<sub>--</sub> Record=SP and Need<sub>--</sub> Rec<sub>--</sub> Calc=TRUE is found (if not found, Process Full<sub>--</sub> Recalc terminates here). Procedure Calc is executed. Cursor is advanced one record and procedure Calc is executed again until Mark<sub>--</sub> Record for Current<sub>--</sub> Record &lt;&gt; SP. If current<sub>--</sub> record is not last<sub>--</sub> record, the next record with Mark<sub>--</sub> Record=SP and Need<sub>--</sub> Rec<sub>--</sub> Calc=TRUE is found and the process starts again from that record.</p>
    <p>FIG. 29 shows a flowchart of procedure Change<sub>--</sub> Case. This procedure changes the active case<sub>--</sub> db file to the next one in sequence.</p>
    <p>FIG. 30 shows a flowchart of procedure Field<sub>--</sub> Input. This procedure accepts user-activated data input into selected spreadsheet cells and selected fields in the active case<sub>--</sub> db file. The following steps are executed: If operating in the APPLICATION environment (that is, environment &lt;&gt; LAYOUT) and there is no screen cursor, then field<sub>--</sub> input is rejected. Else, keyboard input is accepted and written in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range if the current<sub>--</sub> record is also the active record. Then, keyboard input is written in the current<sub>--</sub> record's field. Set Need<sub>--</sub> Rec<sub>--</sub> Calc is set to TRUE for current<sub>--</sub> record. Finally, if the current<sub>--</sub> record is also the previous<sub>--</sub> record, keyboard input is also written in the previous record.</p>
    <p>FIG. 31 shows a flowchart of procedure Execute<sub>--</sub> Parent<sub>--</sub> Environment. This procedure executes user-activated commands in the parent environment. The following steps are executed: When operating in the LAYOUT environment, the APPLICATION environment is defined when the LAYOUT key is pressed. For any other key pressed, the LAYOUT environment acts like the SCRATCH environment. Finally, when operating in the APPLICATION environment, Execute<sub>--</sub> Application<sub>--</sub> Environment must execute. This is not shown in more detail since it must be defined by the user through the LAYOUT command.</p>
    <p>FIG. 32 shows a flowchart of procedure Execute<sub>--</sub> Scratch<sub>--</sub> Environment. This procedure executes user-activated commands in the scratch environment. The SCRATCH environment operates like a prior<sub>--</sub> art spreadsheet environment.</p>
    <p>FIG. 33 shows a flowchart of the procedure through which the program reads the contents of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file and generates a browse view of its contents, through the following steps:</p>
    <p>a) Specifying the col<sub>--</sub> prog range in the spread<sub>--</sub> sa.</p>
    <p>b) Selecting the active case<sub>--</sub> db file.</p>
    <p>c) Reading selected contents from the current record in the active case<sub>--</sub> db file.</p>
    <p>d) Generating the video display showing the actual contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, and a browse view of the contents of all other case<sub>--</sub> db records.</p>
    <p>e) Whenever a spreadsheet calculation is issued during the operation of the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment, reading selected contents from the current record in the active case<sub>--</sub> db file.</p>

    <p>Referring to FIG. 2, the invention's entire program storage area is divided into three storage areas:</p>
    <p>The video system storage area (48) contains the information that is displayed in the computer's video screen. Prior-art references generally locate the video system storage area in reserved locations in the computer system's main memory; this set of reserved locations is usually called display memory.</p>
    <p>The database file storage area (47) contains information in regular database files. Prior-art references generally locate the database file storage area in any large-scale memory component, usually, a computer hard disk.</p>
    <p>The spreadsheet storage area (44) contains information with the same data structures as an ordinary spreadsheet program. Prior-art references generally locate the spreadsheet storage area in the computer system's main memory.</p>
    <heading>VIDEO SYSTEM STORAGE AREA</heading> <p>In this document, the video system storage area will be abbreviated video<sub>--</sub> sa.</p>
    <p>The computer's video screen displays the information contained in the video<sub>--</sub> sa. In most computer systems, the screen displays the modified video<sub>--</sub> sa's contents only an instant after they are actually modified.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 9, the video<sub>--</sub> sa (48) contains selected information from the spread<sub>--</sub> sa (50) and the db<sub>--</sub> sa (47). The original way in which this information is selected and displayed distinguishes this invention from all prior-art references. This will be shown in the description and operation of the invention.</p>
    <heading>DATABASE FILES STORAGE AREA</heading> <p>In this document, the database files storage area will be abbreviated db<sub>--</sub> sa.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 4, the db<sub>--</sub> sa contains information in regular database records and files. These files are called case<sub>--</sub> db files (52 and 54). Their individual records are called case<sub>--</sub> db records.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 3 and 9, the invention refers to the integration of the video<sub>--</sub> sa (55), db<sub>--</sub> sa (47) and spread<sub>--</sub> sa (44). This is managed by operating the information in case<sub>--</sub> db files (52 and 54) one record at a time. For example, a single operation may involve reading only one case<sub>--</sub> db record (53) into a specified range in the spread<sub>--</sub> sa (50). Another operation may involve writing back information into one case<sub>--</sub> db record.</p>
    <p>These operations take place between a specified spread<sub>--</sub> sa range (50) and a case<sub>--</sub> db record (53). A case<sub>--</sub> db record is a set of fields that store numeric or text-based information. Also, the record may contain date or time fields. Alternatively, a record field may store a formula that is interpreted as a spreadsheet formula, when the field is read into a spreadsheet cell.</p>
    <p>In the preferred implementation, each case<sub>--</sub> db record comprises a set of fields of the same size (for example, 8 bytes long). Numeric information is stored in integer or floating point format, with the maximum available precision according to the field's size. Character-based information is stored in text format. Formulas are stored in a different special format.</p>
    <p>Also, the preferred embodiment implementation allows the definition of database files that are not case<sub>--</sub> db files. These database files are called desc<sub>--</sub> db files. A desc<sub>--</sub> db file contains textual descriptions of the case<sub>--</sub> db records' contents for a particular case<sub>--</sub> db file. Each record of a desc<sub>--</sub> db file describes one field of a typical case<sub>--</sub> db record. So, the number of records in a desc<sub>--</sub> db file equals the number of fields in the case<sub>--</sub> db record. If the user wishes to view these descriptions, they are processed through the video<sub>--</sub> sa and shown in the video display.</p>
    <heading>SPREADSHEET STORAGE AREA</heading> <p>Throughout this document, the spreadsheet storage area will be abbreviated spread<sub>--</sub> sa. In the spread<sub>--</sub> sa, information is organized exactly as in an ordinary spreadsheet program.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the spread<sub>--</sub> sa is divided into two integrated physical sections or sets of cells:</p>
    <p>(a) the scratchpad -non-programmable- section (45), and</p>
    <p>(b) the general programmable section (46).</p>
    <p>The names of these sections are abbreviated as scratch section and gen<sub>--</sub> prog section, respectively.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 10, the scratchpad section (45) is a range of cells in the spreadsheet structure. It has its own set of tools and commands to let the user do ordinary spreadsheet operations (59).</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 11, the general programmable section (46) is also a range of cells in the spreadsheet structure with its own set of tools and commands (60). In addition to allowing ordinary spreadsheet operations, it lets the user communicate with database files (47), and develop and use new tools and commands (61).</p>
    <p>While working in the spread<sub>--</sub> sa, the user may select the scratch section or the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section by pressing the section key. This key changes the section where the user is operating to the alternative section. The switching operation is similar to the operation of the WINDOW Function Key (F6 key) in the LOTUS 1-2-3™ spreadsheet program and in other similar spreadsheet programs.</p>
    <p>In reference to FIGS. 10 to 13, the user may interact with each section in the spread<sub>--</sub> sa (44) through any of three environments (59, 60 and 61). Each environment defines a set of commands and options available to the user for the operation of spread<sub>--</sub> sa information. Also, each environment displays the information in the spread<sub>--</sub> sa in a particular way.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 10, one of the environments, the scratch environment (59), handles the information stored in the scratch section (45). When the user is located in the scratch section, the program automatically makes available the scratch environment. It executes like an ordinary spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 11, the program operates on the information in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section in two different ways, depending on one of two environments selected with the environment key: the layout environment (60) and the application environment (61). The layout environment may be used to develop the application environment.</p>
    <p>Throughout the description of the invention, user is any person who uses the invention in any of the three available environments. This person becomes a programmer when using the layout environment to develop an application.</p>
    <p>A more detailed definition of these two environments is necessary to describe the invention:</p>
    <heading>The Layout Environment</heading> <p>This is an enhanced spreadsheet environment that uses a special command set (called the layout command set). The programmer may use this command set to define the tools available to the user for the operation of the application environment. Also, this environment lets the programmer define the elements that allow the simultaneous access and operation of information in case<sub>--</sub> db files and the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section.</p>
    <heading>The Application Environment</heading> <p>This environment comprises the tools that have been defined in the layout environment with the layout command. In the preferred embodiment, these are the only tools and operations that the user will be able to use in the application environment.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, an additional environment (62) operates in the gen-prog section. It is defined in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <heading>Col<sub>--</sub> prog windows, ranges and environments</heading> <p>In the layout environment, the user may create sets of definitions related to the operation on the data in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section and the case<sub>--</sub> db files. Referring to FIG. 3, each one of these sets of definitions will be called a columnar programmable window (49), abbreviated col<sub>--</sub> prog window. Each col<sub>--</sub> prog window is identified by a distinct name, and contains the following definitions:</p>
    <p>a) The location of a specific range of cells within the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section; this range of cells is called col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50).</p>
    <p>b) Whether the database records are chained-dependent (as in a time<sub>--</sub> based application).</p>
    <p>c) If the database records are chained-dependent, the location of another specific range of cells within the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section; this range of cells is called col<sub>--</sub> prev range (51).</p>
    <p>d) The names and directories for all database files whose data will be accessed; these files are called assigned case<sub>--</sub> db files (54).</p>
    <p>e) The identifier of the assigned case<sub>--</sub> db file that will be linked to the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section; this file is called active case<sub>--</sub> db file (55).</p>
    <p>f) The identifier of that record in the active case<sub>--</sub> db file that will be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range; this record is called active record (53).</p>
    <p>Col<sub>--</sub> prog ranges, time<sub>--</sub> based applications, col<sub>--</sub> prev ranges, associate case<sub>--</sub> db files and active case<sub>--</sub> db files will be described later in this document.</p>
    <p>The user presses a special key, called window key, to activate a col<sub>--</sub> prog window. Through this operation, the col<sub>--</sub> prog window becomes the active col<sub>--</sub> prog window. An active col<sub>--</sub> prog window allows the simultaneous access and operation on information from the active case<sub>--</sub> db file and the col<sub>--</sub> prog and col<sub>--</sub> prev ranges contained in its definition. To do this it activates the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 12 and 13, the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment inherits all characteristics from the environment in which it is activated (60 or 61). In this context, this environment acts as a parent environment, because it passes on its properties to the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment. Also, as a parent environment, it allows the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment to add its own significant characteristics.</p>
    <p>The col<sub>--</sub> prog environment controls and coordinates the display of spreadsheet contents and data from the active case<sub>--</sub> db file.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 3, a col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50) is a range of spreadsheet cells that will hold the information in one record of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (52). This record is called the active record (53). In the best mode implementation, the col<sub>--</sub> prog range is a range of adjacent cells located in a single spreadsheet column. In alternative implementations, the col<sub>--</sub> prog range may be an ordered set of disjoint spreadsheet cells.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 14, more than one col<sub>--</sub> prog window may be defined in the invention. However, in the best mode implementation, col<sub>--</sub> prog windows and col<sub>--</sub> prog ranges are in a strict one-to-one relationship. That is, there is one col<sub>--</sub> prog range for each col<sub>--</sub> prog window, and there is one col<sub>--</sub> prog window for each col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <p>The col<sub>--</sub> prog environment has several important characteristics. It controls the operation of the elements defined in the col<sub>--</sub> prog windows. Also, it inherits all the characteristics and basic commands from the parent environment. It adds commands and operations for the access and operation on information in the case<sub>--</sub> db files and the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section. Finally, the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment adds commands for generating the video display of that information, i.e., modifying the contents of the video<sub>--</sub> sa.</p>
    <p>This invention's originality and power are based in the particular operation of the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment.</p>
    <p>All elements described in this summary suffice to be used as a dictionary of the terms involved in the claims of this patent application. However, the following elements and considerations are also important to the operation of this invention.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, a formula in a spread<sub>--</sub> sa cell may reference any other cell in the spread<sub>--</sub> sa. Referenced cells may be located in the scratch section or the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section. They may or may not be displayed in a col<sub>--</sub> prog window. The possibility of formulas that cross-reference the scratch section (45) and the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section (46), is due to the fact that both sections effectively compose a single spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>Gen<sub>--</sub> prog cells are part of the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section, regardless of whether they are in a col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50). They may be accessed and operated as ordinary spreadsheet cells, when working in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section. This implies that the programmer may access a col<sub>--</sub> prog range cell in the layout environment, without activating the col<sub>--</sub> prog window. Also, col<sub>--</sub> prog range cells may store formulas that reference other cells or cell ranges in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section and the scratch section.</p>
    <p>The preferred embodiment allows the programmer to configure the invention otherwise: access to the col<sub>--</sub> prog range's cells may be effected only from within a col<sub>--</sub> prog window.</p>
    <p>Although all gen<sub>--</sub> prog cells are outcome cells initially, the user may define some of gen<sub>--</sub> prog cells as data cells. This cell type definition is transferred to the application environment.</p>
    <p>Outcome cells are mainly related to the design of the application in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section. The programmer must define the formulas in these cells in the layout environment. The user in the application environment cannot modify these cells' contents.</p>
    <p>Data cells accept data input from the user in the application environment. Data input can be texts, numbers or formulas.</p>
    <p>The user may specify the contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range cells as "temporary" or "permanent." Permanent cells are not modified when the program loads a database record into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, because it does not load record fields into col<sub>--</sub> prog range permanent cells. The program only loads those fields that will be placed in temporary cells.</p>
    <p>All outcome cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range must be permanent cells. All data cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range are initially set up as temporary cells, but the user may specify them as permanent cells.</p>
    <p>The main spreadsheet file stores all texts, numbers or formulas defined in outcome cells. This file is identified by the suffix ANS, for ans<sub>--</sub> file ("analysis-spreadsheet-file"). All texts, numbers or formulas defined in permanent data cells are stored in a separate file, identified by the suffix CAP, for cap<sub>--</sub> file ("hat file").</p>
    <p>According to the cell identification described in the preceding paragraphs, the ans<sub>--</sub> file contains the formulas that define the application developed in the layout environment. It also enables the program to store, in a cap<sub>--</sub> file, information that a particular user wishes to protect from other users of the same application. This scheme to store each type of information in a different file provides maximum protection to the programmer and to each individual user.</p>
    <p>As described previously, if a permanent data cell contains a formula, it is stored in a cap<sub>--</sub> file. In the preferred embodiment implementation, the file-save command also stores the current results of evaluating this formula in the ans<sub>--</sub> file, together with the outcome cells' contents. This ensures the integrity of the information contained in the ans<sub>--</sub> file.</p>
    <p>In special applications described as "time-based," a col<sub>--</sub> prog range works closely with a related idea: the col<sub>--</sub> prev range. As seen in FIG. 3, in the best mode implementation, the col<sub>--</sub> prev range (51) is a single column of adjacent spreadsheet cells, located immediately to the left of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50).</p>
    <p>A time-based or record-chained application is an application whose data is contained in ordered records. An ordered record depends on the record previous to it. In these applications, the records compose a chained structure with dependency relationships, so they are called chained-dependent records. Chained-dependent records are mostly used for time-based applications. Yet, the idea should be envisioned in a broader applicability context.</p>
    <p>One example of a time-based application is a financial model. In this type of model, the sales level may change for a particular period. This causes a variation in the financial statements corresponding to that period and subsequent periods.</p>
    <p>Dependency between records is not the case in all applications. For example, in an inventory analysis model, each database record contains the information corresponding to a single product. Thus, a database record in this kind of model represents a completely independent object.</p>
    <p>In all time-based applications, each col<sub>--</sub> prog range has an associated col<sub>--</sub> prev range. When a database record is loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, it becomes the active record. Then, the database record (previous record) located immediately before the active record is loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prev range.</p>
    <p>Formulas access values in the previous record, which have already been loaded into the spreadsheet. Thus, this idea enables the program to calculate formulas in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range much faster.</p>
    <p>Only time-based applications employ a col<sub>--</sub> prev range. Therefore, a programmer should decide beforehand whether to process the application as time-based, and configure program settings accordingly.</p>
    <p>All elements described in this description suffice to be used as a dictionary of the terms involved in the claims.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 9, under the control of the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment, the video display (48) shows an interactive database browse view of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (52). This browse view is similar to those generated by the BROWSE command in prior-art database programs.</p>
    <p>Yet, the invention's browse view has some specific differences. The invention's browse view displays all the records' contents that fit in the view window, except for those of the active record (53). Instead of the information contents of the active record, the video displays those of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50). The screen displays the contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range cells. In the special case of formula-containing cells, by default the screen displays the results of formula operations, as is usual in ordinary spreadsheet programs</p>
    <p>The operations of the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment involve memory elements called dynamic links. Dynamic links are storage elements that contain the actual value of the identifiers of the active case<sub>--</sub> db records that are being accessed by the spread<sub>--</sub> sa. They coordinate the operation of the case<sub>--</sub> db files and the col<sub>--</sub> prog window. There are two distinct dynamic links, depending on the case<sub>--</sub> db record to which they point:</p>
    <p>1) the identifier for the current record, and</p>
    <p>2) the identifier for the active record.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 33, the program reads the contents of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file and generates a browse view of its contents, through the following steps:</p>
    <p>a) Specifying the col<sub>--</sub> prog range in the spread<sub>--</sub> sa, where the contents of individual records from the active case<sub>--</sub> db file may be read.</p>
    <p>b) Selecting the active case<sub>--</sub> db file.</p>
    <p>c) Reading selected contents from the current record in the active case<sub>--</sub> db file. By this operation, the current record becomes the active<sub>--</sub> record.</p>
    <p>d) Generating the video display showing the actual contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, and simultaneously showing a browse view of the actual contents of all case<sub>--</sub> db records different than the active record. Notice, that the video display may show the col<sub>--</sub> prog range contents interpreting texts as texts, numbers as numbers, and formulas as the results of evaluating said formulas. This is the default mode of operation in prior-art spreadsheet programs.</p>
    <p>e) Whenever a spreadsheet calculation is issued during the operation of the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment, reading selected contents from the current record in the active case<sub>--</sub> db file, where the current record is chosen by the screen cursor's position.</p>
    <p>While this operation is performed, the condition of the current record's dynamic link is determined by the screen cursor's movements and position. The actual value of the current record's dynamic link determines which case<sub>--</sub> db record is the current record. Thus, the current record is selected according to the condition of the current record's dynamic link.</p>
    <p>When the contents from the current record the case<sub>--</sub> db file are loaded to the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (step `c` above), the active record's dynamic link is changed to the contents of the current record's dynamic link. Thus, the active record's dynamic link can identify again the record loaded from the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (that is, it remembers which record is the active record).</p>
    <p>This invention's originality and power are based in the operation of the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment. The way it controls the operation of the video system storage area is particularly important.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 3 and 12, the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment (62) has several important characteristics. It controls the operation of the elements defined in the col<sub>--</sub> prog windows (49). Also, it inherits all the characteristics and basic commands from the parent environment (60 and 61). It adds commands and operations for the access and operation of information in the case<sub>--</sub> db files (52 and 54) and the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section (46). Finally, the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment adds commands for generating the video display of that information, i.e., modifying the contents of the video<sub>--</sub> sa (47).</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 9, under the control of the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment, the video display shows--i.e., the video<sub>--</sub> sa (47) stores--an interactive database browse view of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (52)). This browse view is similar to any one generated by the BROWSE command, in prior-art references such as the FOXBASE+™ and the FOXPRO™ programmable database file managers, by Fox Software Inc., the DBASE II™ and the DBASE III™ database file managers, by Ashton Tate Corporation, and others. The cursor key and data input operations involved are similar to those used by these programs.</p>
    <p>Yet, the invention's browse view has some specific differences. The invention's browse view displays all the records' contents that fit in the view window, except for those of the active record (53). In the screen, the information contents of the active record are substituted by those of the corresponding col<sub>--</sub> prog range (50). The screen displays the contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range cells. In the special case of formula-containing cells, by default the screen displays the results of formula operations.</p>
    <p>The col<sub>--</sub> prog environment also implements operations that require a dynamic connection between the active case<sub>--</sub> db file and the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. Examples of these are the simple<sub>--</sub> calc and full<sub>--</sub> recalc operations.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 27, when a simple<sub>--</sub> calc operation is issued, the record identified by the screen cursor (current record) is loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. Thus, according to the definition, it immediately becomes the active record. Also, if the operation is time<sub>--</sub> based, the record before the active record (previous record) is loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prev range.</p>
    <p>FIG. 28 shows a simplified rendering of Procedure Full<sub>--</sub> Recalc. The full<sub>--</sub> recalc operation is more complicated. It is a structured sequence of simple<sub>--</sub> calc operations that involve memory elements called dynamic links. Dynamic links are storage elements that contain the actual value of the identifiers of the active case<sub>--</sub> db records that are being accessed by the spread<sub>--</sub> sa. They coordinate the operation of the case<sub>--</sub> db files and the col<sub>--</sub> prog window.</p>
    <p>Two dynamic links have already been described in the operation of the invention's summary. Besides these, a third dynamic link is important to the operation of this invention. Hence, there are effectively three distinct dynamic links, depending on the record of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file to which they point:</p>
    <p>1) the identifier for the current record,</p>
    <p>2) the identifier for the active record, and</p>
    <p>3) the identifier for the previous record.</p>
    <p>The following sections will describe essential elements of this invention's operation in the same order in which they are presented in the algorithm (see Appendix A). FIGS. 16 and 17 present abbreviated flowcharts of this program's execution.</p>
    <p>Environment Set-Up (procedure Initiate)</p>
    <p>Sections and Environments (procedures Select<sub>--</sub> Environment, Select<sub>--</sub> Window and Select<sub>--</sub> Section)</p>
    <p>Basic Video Operations (procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Video)</p>
    <p>Formula Editing (procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Formula<sub>--</sub> Edit)</p>
    <p>Database Records Flags (procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Mark<sub>--</sub> Record)</p>
    <p>Simple Recalculation (procedure Calc)</p>
    <p>Full Recalculation (procedure Full<sub>--</sub> Recalc)</p>
    <p>Active and Assigned Case<sub>--</sub> Db Files (procedure Change<sub>--</sub> Case)</p>
    <p>Field Input (procedure Field<sub>--</sub> Input)</p>
    <p>Execution of Parent and Scratch Environments (procedures Execute<sub>--</sub> Parent<sub>--</sub> Environment and Execute<sub>--</sub> Scratch<sub>--</sub> Environment)</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 16 and 17, all elements necessary to the operation of the invention are defined (initiate). If the Quit<sub>--</sub> key is pressed, the program terminates, else, it waits for a keypress. According to the key pressed, the program selects a section or does a different action. If section &lt;&gt; Gen<sub>--</sub> Prog, Scratch<sub>--</sub> Environment is executed. If the Environment<sub>--</sub> Key is pressed, an environment is selected. If the Window<sub>--</sub> Key is pressed, the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment and the col<sub>--</sub> prog window are activated or deactivated. If the col<sub>--</sub> prog window is deactivated, the Parent<sub>--</sub> Environment is executed.</p>
    <p>Finally, if the col<sub>--</sub> prog window is activated, according to the key pressed, the invention may execute any of the following processes: process<sub>--</sub> video, process<sub>--</sub> formula<sub>--</sub> edit, process<sub>--</sub> mark<sub>--</sub> record, process calc, full<sub>--</sub> recalc, change<sub>--</sub> case, field<sub>--</sub> input, or execute<sub>--</sub> parent<sub>--</sub> environment. See Appendix A, part 2, and FIG. 18.</p>
    <p>The environment will be set up with the specifications that are necessary to show the operation of essential elements. It is important to notice that the environment could be set up otherwise, for different purposes.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 18, this procedure may be abbreviated as follows: A section and environment are selected (by default, the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section in the layout environment). Case<sub>--</sub> db files are created. The col<sub>--</sub> prog window is defined. Data cells and permanent cells are defined. Spreadsheet formulas are defined.</p>
    <p>Procedure Setup also comprises the definition of the Col<sub>--</sub> Prog Window, shown in FIG. 19. A summarized description of this procedure follows: The col<sub>--</sub> prog window is named and thus, identified. The following definitions are enacted: col<sub>--</sub> prog range, time<sub>--</sub> based (TRUE or FALSE), col<sub>--</sub> prev range (if time<sub>--</sub> based=TRUE), assigned case<sub>--</sub> db files, the identifiers for each assigned case<sub>--</sub> db file and the identifier for the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (which, in turn, is activated), the active record's identifier.</p>
    <p>A more detailed description of Procedure Setup is presented in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <p>The operation of the invention may be described similarly in the layout or in the application environment. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity, this description will primarily consider the case of the layout environment. The differences in the application environment are not essential to understanding the invention's operation.</p>
    <p>After the program begins to execute, the user selects the layout environment in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section to define one or more col<sub>--</sub> prog windows. (This is represented by the statements "Init<sub>--</sub> section(GEN<sub>--</sub> PROG)" and "Init<sub>--</sub> environment(LAYOUT)" in procedure Initiate).</p>
    <p>The user may create the necessary case<sub>--</sub> db files (statement "Create<sub>--</sub> Dbf"). Yet this is optional, because the user may create these files independently of this invention.</p>
    <p>The user must define a col<sub>--</sub> prog window in the layout environment (statement "define col<sub>--</sub> prog window"). Although the invention contemplates the definition of several col<sub>--</sub> prog windows, this description requires only one col<sub>--</sub> prog window definition.</p>
    <p>The definition of a col<sub>--</sub> prog window begins by naming it (statement "identify col<sub>--</sub> prog window"). The following items compose the named col<sub>--</sub> prog window:</p>
    <p>a) The location of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (statement "define col<sub>--</sub> prog range");</p>
    <p>b) Whether the database records are chained-dependent (statement "time<sub>--</sub> based:=TRUE");</p>
    <p>c) If the database records are chained-dependent, the location of the col<sub>--</sub> prev range (statement "if (time<sub>--</sub> based) then define col<sub>--</sub> prev range");</p>
    <p>d) The names and directories for the assigned case<sub>--</sub> db files (statement "assign case<sub>--</sub> dbf");</p>
    <p>e) The identifier of the assigned case<sub>--</sub> db file that will be the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (statement "active case<sub>--</sub> dbf:=assigned case<sub>--</sub> dbf[id<sub>--</sub> file]");</p>
    <p>f) The identifier of the initial active record for the operation of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file (statement "define<sub>--</sub> id(active record)").</p>
    <p>Each case<sub>--</sub> db file assigned to a col<sub>--</sub> prog window has an associated identifier. This identifier allows the program to select a case<sub>--</sub> db file for activation, without requiring the file's directory and name. Each identifier also allows the program to activate case<sub>--</sub> db files more efficiently than if they had not been previously assigned to the col<sub>--</sub> prog window.</p>
    <p>The active case<sub>--</sub> db file is selected from the assigned case<sub>--</sub> db files by using the case<sub>--</sub> db file identifier. This is exactly how the SELECT command operates in prior-art database programs. These programs allow only one file to be selected at a time. This matches the invention's restriction of allowing only one active case<sub>--</sub> db file at any time.</p>
    <p>Each record in the active case<sub>--</sub> db file also has an associated identifier. This identifier allows the invention to select a case<sub>--</sub> db record to read from or write to it. Thus, record identifiers operate similarly to the assigned case<sub>--</sub> db file identifiers.</p>
    <p>Three related entities, called dynamic links, are essential to the operation of the invention. Each dynamic link contains the actual value of the identifier corresponding, respectively, to the current record, the active record and the previous record. These dynamic links also have to be defined at this stage of program execution. Finally, to finish the environment set-up, the user defines data cells and formulas in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section, and permanent cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range (statements "define data cells", "define permanent cells" and "define formulas"). As mentioned previously, all cells in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section are outcome cells, unless they are defined as data cells. Also, by default, data cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range are temporary cells, unless they are defined as permanent cells. Outcome cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range are already permanent cells, and the user may not modify their status.</p>
    <p>The dimension of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range and the dimension of each record in the active case<sub>--</sub> db file may not be the same. The invention may handle this problem in several ways. The following paragraphs describe the solution envisioned for the preferred embodiment implementation:</p>
    <p>1) If the number of cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range is greater than the number of fields in the case<sub>--</sub> db file, the program loads the entire case<sub>--</sub> db record into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. In this case it does not modify the remaining cells of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <p>2) If the number of cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range is smaller than the number of fields in the case<sub>--</sub> db file, the program loads only the record fields that fit into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <p>3) In both cases, the unload operation writes back the same number of fields that was loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <heading>SECTIONS AND ENVIRONMENTS</heading> <heading>Procedures Select<sub>--</sub> Section, Select<sub>--</sub> Environment and Select<sub>--</sub> Window</heading> <p>See Appendix A, parts 5, 6, and 7.</p>
    <p>Also see FIGS. 21, 22 and 23.</p>
    <p>The user can select whether to operate in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section or the scratch section. In the scratch section, the scratch environment takes control of the user interface. While operating in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section, the user may choose between the layout environment and the application environment. Also, in any of these environments, the user can activate or deactivate the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment implementation demonstrated in Appendix A, parts 5, 6 and 7, the key-activated commands allow the user to make a choice.</p>
    <p>Also, in the preferred embodiment implementation, a special key called the window<sub>--</sub> key activates or deactivates a col<sub>--</sub> prog window. When there is only one col<sub>--</sub> prog window, the window<sub>--</sub> key acts as a switch to put the user in the col<sub>--</sub> prog window or take the user out of it. When there is more than one col<sub>--</sub> prog window, the window<sub>--</sub> key displays a list of options. This list contains all defined col<sub>--</sub> prog windows defined, with their respective environments, and the layout environment. The user points to the desired environment and the program provides immediate access to the selected environment.</p>
    <heading>BASIC VIDEO OPERATIONS</heading> <heading>Procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Video</heading> <p>See Appendix A, part 8, and see FIG. 24.</p>
    <p>As already described, when the user is in a col<sub>--</sub> prog environment, the video<sub>--</sub> sa generates an interactive database browse view of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file. Cursor keys and data input operations are similar to those of ordinary database browse operations.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 24, this procedure may be abbreviated as follows: Two previous conditions are taken into consideration: the key pressed (any cursor key activates this procedure), and the previous state of the video screen display. All case<sub>--</sub> db records are shown in a browse view, except for the active record, in whose place the col<sub>--</sub> prog range is shown. Data indicators, cursors and video indicators are shown as required.</p>
    <p>A more detailed description of Procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Video is presented in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <p>With the exception of the active record, all the records' information that fits in the view window is shown immediately in a browse view. For the active record, its own view is substituted by a view of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. This view actually displayed the contents of the cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. Formula-containing cells are shown by displaying the results of formula operations on the contents of the active record.</p>
    <p>Also, the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment implements operations that require a dynamic connection between the active case<sub>--</sub> db file and the col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <p>Examples of these operations are the simple<sub>--</sub> calc and full<sub>--</sub> recalc operations.</p>
    <heading>Cursor keys</heading> <p>The browse view in the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment shows the case<sub>--</sub> db records in columnar view. By pressing the right or left cursor keys within the col<sub>--</sub> prog window, the user can look at different records of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file. Similarly, by pressing the up and down cursor keys, the user can look at different fields of a case<sub>--</sub> db record. This operation is similar to a browse operation in a database program.</p>
    <p>The span of the information limits the movement of the cursor keys. For example, the right cursor key operates until it points to the last record in the assigned database file. The size of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range limits up and down movements. The col<sub>--</sub> prog range size depends on the spreadsheet range defined for a particular screen in the application environment.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment implementation for the invention, pressing the Ctrl key and a right or left cursor key executes control cursor key operations. These operations place the cursor immediately at the designated edge of the screen.</p>
    <heading>Data and outcome fields</heading> <p>The type of operation on an individual record field depends on whether it corresponds to a data or to an outcome cell in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. Thus, a data field is a record field that would be placed in a data cell, if the record that contains it was loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. An outcome field is a record field that would be placed in an outcome cell, under similar circumstances. Data fields are the only fields that may be modified while the program is operating in the application environment.</p>
    <heading>The screen cursor</heading> <p>The screen cursor signals the position where the next data input operation will be executed. Thus, it is visible only if the screen displays at least one col<sub>--</sub> prog data cell or data field. When it is visible, the screen column where it is positioned shows the contents of the current record.</p>
    <p>If the screen does not display any data cells or data fields, the column cursor is active instead of the screen cursor. The column cursor's position always indicates the current record.</p>
    <heading>Logical chain of procedural statements</heading> <p>The program executes, in the following order, the essential ideas described for the video operation of the col<sub>--</sub> prog window (see Appendix A, part 8 -procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Video):</p>
    <p>1. Initialize all state variables (flags).</p>
    <p>2. Determine the video screen's boundaries. Position the screen and column cursors, according to their previous conditions and the cursor key pressed by the user (keypress).</p>
    <p>3. Display all records as in a browse view, except the active record which is substituted by the col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <p>4. Use special indicators to display all col<sub>--</sub> prog range data cells and data fields in the col<sub>--</sub> prog window (in most prior-art references, data cells and data fields are represented in a different color).</p>
    <p>5. Show the screen cursor only if any col<sub>--</sub> prog range data cells or data fields are visible in the screen. Show the column cursor if the screen cursor is not visible.</p>
    <p>6. Display modified video indicators. Most important among these are: mark<sub>--</sub> record flags, need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc flags, active column indicator, need<sub>--</sub> spreadsheet<sub>--</sub> calc flag, available spreadsheet memory, other spreadsheet and database indicators.</p>
    <heading>FORMULA EDITING</heading> <heading>Procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Formula<sub>--</sub> Edit</heading> <p>See Appendix A, part 9, and also see FIG. 25.</p>
    <p>The user presses the formula<sub>--</sub> edit<sub>--</sub> key to modify a col<sub>--</sub> prog range formula in the cell where the cursor is.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 25, this procedure may be abbreviated as follows: If environment is LAYOUT, then formula<sub>--</sub> edit is accepted and results are marked for storage in the ANS file. Else, formula<sub>--</sub> edit is accepted and results are marked for storage in the CAP file, only if current cell is data cell. Else, formula<sub>--</sub> edit is rejected.</p>
    <p>A more detailed description of Procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Formula<sub>--</sub> Edit is presented in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <p>The application environment does not allow formula edition in outcome cells. This is possible only in the layout environment.</p>
    <p>In the layout environment, if the cursor is on an outcome cell, the cell accepts the action of the formula<sub>--</sub> edit key. This executes the formula edit operation. The formula will be saved in the ans<sub>--</sub> file, the main spreadsheet file. This file also stores all texts, numbers or formulas defined in permanent outcome cells.</p>
    <p>If the cursor is on a data cell, regardless of the environment, the formula<sub>--</sub> edit<sub>--</sub> key executes the formula edit operation. This operation is similar to formula edit operations in ordinary spreadsheet programs. If the data cell is a permanent cell, the formula will be saved in the cap<sub>--</sub> file. In the preferred embodiment implementation, the value resulting from the evaluation of that formula is also stored in the ans<sub>--</sub> file.</p>
    <p>These protection modes allow the programmer and the user to get maximum benefit from the program's features. In the layout environment of the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section, the programmer can build an application by defining or editing formulas in the outcome cells. Then the programmer deliberately transforms the layout environment into the application environment, to let the user evaluate the formulas on the data. For example, in a financial model, the user may want to examine the consequences of changes in the firm's financial conditions. To do this, the user modifies all data cells in the application environment, even if they contain formulas.</p>
    <heading>DATABASE RECORDS FLAGS</heading> <heading>Procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Mark<sub>--</sub> Record</heading> <p>See Appendix A, part 10, and also see FIG. 26.</p>
    <p>The mark<sub>--</sub> record key controls a state variable (flag) associated to each record in a case<sub>--</sub> db file. This state variable is the mark<sub>--</sub> record flag. The mark<sub>--</sub> record flag variable controls whether a database record can be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range when required.</p>
    <p>The mark<sub>--</sub> record key can switch the status of a record to any of three possible conditions:</p>
    <p>SP (SPreadsheet),</p>
    <p>DB (DataBase),</p>
    <p>PR (PRotected).</p>
    <p>SP allows a record to be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, and to be modified.</p>
    <p>DB does not allow a record to be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, although it may be modified.</p>
    <p>PR is the most restrictive status, because it does not allow the record to be modified or loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. When a record is in PR status, the scrolling of the screen is active but all record fields may not be modified. The screen cursor has access to these fields only if the mark<sub>--</sub> record key switches the record to a different status.</p>
    <p>The user presses the mark<sub>--</sub> record key until the mark<sub>--</sub> record flat is set to DB to signal the contents of a record that are not going to be modified in the application environment. In a financial application, for example, a user prepares an extensive set of records that contain the financial history of the firm. The user does not want to modify these records while running the model. So, the user sets the mark<sub>--</sub> record flag OFF for every period (record) of historical data.</p>
    <p>The operation of mark<sub>--</sub> record flags in simple and full recalculation (sections 5 and 6) and field input (section 7) will clarify the functions of this key.</p>
    <heading>SIMPLE RECALCULATION</heading> <heading>Procedure Calc</heading> <p>See Appendix A, part 11, and also see FIG. 27.</p>
    <p>Two kinds of recalculation are possible: simple recalculation (CALC or recalc, for short) and full recalculation. The calc<sub>--</sub> key activates simple recalculation (procedure calc).</p>
    <p>FIG. 27 shows a simplified case, where Mark<sub>--</sub> Record and Need<sub>--</sub> Rec<sub>--</sub> Calc flags are not considered. In this figure, the sequence of steps followed are: If the current record is also the active record, then a spreadsheet calc is executed and the process ends. Else, a spreadsheet calc is executed if needed, then the col<sub>--</sub> prog range's contents are written to the active record, the current record's contents are read into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. The current record is then identified as the active record and, if application is time<sub>--</sub> based, the previous<sub>--</sub> record is also loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prev range. Finally, a spreadsheet calc is executed.</p>
    <p>A more detailed description of Procedure Calc is presented in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <p>When the user presses the calc<sub>--</sub> key, the program begins procedure calc. Procedure calc executes two basic operations:</p>
    <p>a) a read operation of the current record to the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, if allowed by the current record's mark<sub>--</sub> record flag, and</p>
    <p>b) a spreadsheet recalc.</p>
    <p>For the first operation, the program identifies the current record as the record where the screen (column) cursor is. Then the current record is compared to the active record, which is the last record loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. (More properly said, its identifiers are compared. Record identifiers are numbers used to point and select specific records in the case<sub>--</sub> db file. If two records' identifiers are the same number, then these records are the same.)</p>
    <p>If the current record and the active record are the same (i.e., their identifiers are the same), the program only performs a spreadsheet recalc. A spreadsheet recalc executes all formulas defined in the spreadsheet cells. This operation is performed as in the most popular spreadsheet programs currently in the market, such as the LOTUS 1-2-3™ release 2.2 spreadsheet program.</p>
    <p>If the current record is not the same record as the active record, then the program checks if the current record may be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. The mark<sub>--</sub> record flag forbids such operation if its status is "DB" or "PR." The current record may be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range only if the status of the mark<sub>--</sub> record flag for the current record is SP. If the current record may not be loaded, procedure calc only executes a spreadsheet recalc.</p>
    <p>Before the current record is loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, the col<sub>--</sub> prog range has to "unload" by writing its contents back to the active record (the last record loaded) in the case<sub>--</sub> db file.</p>
    <p>Also, before unloading the contents of the col<sub>--</sub> prog range to the active record, the need<sub>--</sub> spreadsheet<sub>--</sub> calc flag has to be checked. If the need<sub>--</sub> spreadsheet<sub>--</sub> calc flag is TRUE, then the spreadsheet needs to be recalculated, since one or more spreadsheet data have been changed with no subsequent spreadsheet recalc. In this case, a spreadsheet recalc is executed before the col<sub>--</sub> prog range is unloaded. Otherwise, the col<sub>--</sub> prog range's results would not be correct when written back to the active record.</p>
    <p>The total sequence of operation in procedure calc is as follows. First, a spreadsheet calc is executed (if needed). Then, if the current record is going to be read into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, the col<sub>--</sub> prog range "unloads" by writing its entire cells' contents to the active record (this is needed in order to save the col<sub>--</sub> prog range's contents). After this operation, if mark<sub>--</sub> record's status for current record is SP, the current record is loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. Thus, the current record becomes the new active record. Finally, a spreadsheet recalc is always executed.</p>
    <p>A special consideration has to be made when the current record is loaded (read) from the database file into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. The col<sub>--</sub> prog range may contain permanent data, texts and formulas, and this read operation may not modify permanent cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range.</p>
    <p>Finally, in a time-based application, when the program loads a record into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, it must also read the previous record into the col<sub>--</sub> prev range. The col<sub>--</sub> prev range cells may only contain data, not formulas. The previous record must be read entirely into the col<sub>--</sub> prev range.</p>
    <p>Notice that the mark<sub>--</sub> record flag does not control whether the previous record can be loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prev range. This range cannot be modified and is not subject to recalculation, since it contains only data. Also, the col<sub>--</sub> prev range does not write information back to the database record from which it read.</p>
    <heading>FULL RECALCULATION</heading> <heading>Procedure Full<sub>--</sub> Recalc</heading> <p>See Appendix A, part 12, and also see FIG. 28.</p>
    <p>The full recalculation procedure, or procedure full<sub>--</sub> recalc, is a composite calculation procedure that applies only to time-based applications. Full recalculation requires the application to be previously defined as time-based.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 28, this procedure may be abbreviated as follows: If application is not time<sub>--</sub> based, then this process doesn't execute any operations. Else, cursor is positioned at first record (that is, the first record is made the current record). The next record with Mark<sub>--</sub> Record=SP and Need<sub>--</sub> Rec<sub>--</sub> Calc=TRUE is found (if not found, Process Full<sub>--</sub> Recalc terminates here). Procedure Calc is executed. Cursor is advanced one record and procedure Calc is executed again until Mark<sub>--</sub> Record for Current<sub>--</sub> Record &lt;&gt; SP. If current<sub>--</sub> record is not last<sub>--</sub> record, the next record with Mark<sub>--</sub> Record=SP and Need<sub>--</sub> Rec<sub>--</sub> Calc=TRUE is found and the process starts again from that record.</p>
    <p>A more detailed description of Procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Formula<sub>--</sub> Edit is presented in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <p>Full recalculation executes procedure calc repeatedly. It stops until it has calculated and written back all database records that had to be evaluated, due to changes in a data set. In a financial model, for example, a sales level change for a given period alters the financial statements for all subsequent periods. Therefore, a full recalculation is necessary, to update all periods after the change.</p>
    <p>For procedure full<sub>--</sub> recalc to operate adequately, it is necessary to define an additional state variable for each case<sub>--</sub> db record: the need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc flag. A need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc flag has two possible states: TRUE and FALSE. The need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc flag is set to TRUE when the user modifies at least one field in the database record. It is set to FALSE when the database record contents are loaded into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range, calculated, and written back to the same database record.</p>
    <p>Procedure full<sub>--</sub> recalc is activated by pressing the full<sub>--</sub> recalc key. The operational sequence may be described as follows:</p>
    <p>1. The procedure checks the status of the mark<sub>--</sub> record flag and the need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc flag in each record of the active case<sub>--</sub> db file.</p>
    <p>2. The first record with the following two characteristics is identified:</p>
    <p>a) the mark<sub>--</sub> record flag set to SP, and</p>
    <p>b) the need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc flag set to TRUE.</p>
    <p> The screen cursor is placed over this record.</p>
    <p>3. The procedure executes a simple calc operation on the current record. It repeats the process on all contiguous and subsequent records that have the mark<sub>--</sub> record flag set to SP. Notice that the program does not examine the status of subsequent records' need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc flags after the current record.</p>
    <p>4. This repetitive procedure stops immediately before reaching the first record with a mark<sub>--</sub> record flag that is not set to SP.</p>
    <p>5. Procedure full<sub>--</sub> recalc then searches for the next record with mark<sub>--</sub> record flag set to SP and need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc flag set to TRUE. If it finds such a record, the entire procedure is repeated. Otherwise, the procedure stops.</p>
    <heading>ACTIVE AND ASSIGNED CASE DB FILES</heading> <heading>Procedures Define<sub>--</sub> Col<sub>--</sub> Prog<sub>--</sub> Window and Change<sub>--</sub> Case</heading> <p>See Appendix A, parts 3 and 13, and also see FIG. 29.</p>
    <p>One or more case<sub>--</sub> db files can be assigned to a col<sub>--</sub> prog window. The user may define these assignments. This is represented by the following statement in the algorithmic procedure "Define<sub>--</sub> Col<sub>--</sub> Prog<sub>--</sub> Window": "assign case<sub>--</sub> dbf". (See Appendix A, part 3.)</p>
    <p>Only one assigned case<sub>--</sub> db file can be active at any particular time. In the best mode implementation, the user can change the active case<sub>--</sub> db file by pressing the change<sub>--</sub> case key. This operation activates the assigned case<sub>--</sub> db file whose identifier immediately succeeds the identifier of the previous active case<sub>--</sub> db file. (See Appendix A, part 13.)</p>
    <heading>FIELD INPUT</heading> <heading>Procedures Main and Field<sub>--</sub> Input</heading> <p>See Appendix A, parts 1 and 14, and also see FIG. 30.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 30, this procedure may be abbreviated as follows: If operating in the APPLICATION environment (that is, environment &lt;&gt; LAYOUT) and there is no screen cursor, then field<sub>--</sub> input is rejected. Else, keyboard input is accepted and written in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range if the current<sub>--</sub> record is also the active record. Then, keyboard input is written in the current<sub>--</sub> record's field. Set Need<sub>--</sub> Rec<sub>--</sub> Calc is set to TRUE for current<sub>--</sub> record. Finally, if the current<sub>--</sub> record is also the previous<sub>--</sub> record, keyboard input is also written in the previous record.</p>
    <p>The screen cursor is visible only when it is on any col<sub>--</sub> prog data cell or database data field on the screen. When the user presses a cursor key, the video cursor moves to the next data cell or data field located in the direction indicated by the key. If the screen does not display any data cells or data fields, the video cursor is not visible.</p>
    <p>A more detailed description of Procedure Process<sub>--</sub> Formula<sub>--</sub> Edit is presented in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <p>To modify the information of any case<sub>--</sub> db record field, the user places the cursor on the required field and writes the value or text desired.</p>
    <p>While operating in the col-prog environment, a field input operation begins when the user presses any key of a set of keys defined previously. See Appendix A, part 1, procedure Main, statement "if (Keypress in ANY<sub>--</sub> INPUT<sub>--</sub> KEY) then Field<sub>--</sub> Input". ANY<sub>--</sub> INPUT<sub>--</sub> KEY represents a set of keys that are validated to begin field input. In the preferred embodiment implementation, if the first character is a number or any of the signs "()+-," the field will be stored in a floating point number format. Otherwise, the field will be stored as a text field.</p>
    <p>The layout environment allows the modification of all fields in every record and all cells in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. In the application environment, there are several limitations:</p>
    <p>1) only data fields can be modified, and</p>
    <p>2) the records that contain them cannot have mark<sub>--</sub> record flags set to PR (protected).</p>
    <p>In a financial model, for example, all historical financial information should not be modifiable. The associated records have mark<sub>--</sub> record flags set to PR, to prevent the program from loading them into the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. Also, the screen does not display any data fields belonging to these records.</p>
    <p>Finally, in all situations, any input operation in a case<sub>--</sub> db record field will set the need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc to TRUE.</p>
    <heading>Logical chain of procedural statements</heading> <p>The program executes, in the following order, the essential ideas just described for field input (see Appendix A, part 14-procedure Field<sub>--</sub> Input):</p>
    <p>1. Determine if the screen cursor is visible in the current record. If not, then end procedure field<sub>--</sub> input. Otherwise, continue.</p>
    <p>2. Clear the input buffer. Accept keyboard input at the input buffer.</p>
    <p>3. If the current record is the same as the active record, then write keyboard input only in the corresponding col<sub>--</sub> prog cell.</p>
    <p>4. If the current record is not the active record nor the previous record, then write keyboard input in the current record's corresponding field. Then set need<sub>--</sub> rec<sub>--</sub> calc to TRUE for current record.</p>
    <p>5. If the current record is the previous record, then write in the col<sub>--</sub> prev range.</p>
    <heading>EXECUTION OF PARENT AND SCRATCH ENVIRONMENTS</heading> <heading>Procedures Main, Execute<sub>--</sub> Parent<sub>--</sub> Environment and Execute<sub>--</sub> Scratch<sub>--</sub> Environment</heading> <p>See Appendix A, parts 1, 15 and 16, and FIG. 31.</p>
    <p>At any given time, the active environment in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section is the environment that controls the operation of the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section. The user selects the active environment through the use of a special key, called the environment key. As explained before, only the layout and the application environments can be the active environment in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section.</p>
    <p>When the user operates in the scratch environment, or in the layout or application environment in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section, the active environment controls the operation of the invention. Yet, when the user operates in the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment, there are several special considerations.</p>
    <p>The col<sub>--</sub> prog environment inherits from the active environment in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section the commands that do not conflict with its proprietary commands. As mentioned previously, this is why the layout and the application environments may be called parent environments.</p>
    <p>In the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment, if the user presses a key that is not defined in its proprietary commands, the program checks the command set of the parent environment. See Appendix A, part 1, procedure Main, statement "if (Keypress in ANY<sub>--</sub> OTHER<sub>--</sub> KEY) then Execute<sub>--</sub> Parent<sub>--</sub> Environment". Statements in procedure Main show all proprietary commands of the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment.</p>
    <p>The scratch environment is a spreadsheet environment, while the layout environment is an enhanced spreadsheet environment. Consequently, the layout environment matches the scratch environment in the commands that do not conflict with its proprietary commands. See Appendix A, parts 15 and 16, procedures Execute<sub>--</sub> Parent<sub>--</sub> Environment and Execute<sub>--</sub> Scratch<sub>--</sub> Environment.</p>
    <heading>NON-ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS</heading> <p>There are several operations that are not necessary for the operation of this invention. Some of them are described in the following paragraphs. These operations are not shown in the pseudocode algorithm of Appendix A.</p>
    <heading>Simultaneous video operation of assigned case<sub>--</sub> db files</heading> <p>In the preferred embodiment implementation, records from all assigned case<sub>--</sub> db files may be displayed simultaneously on the col<sub>--</sub> prog window video screen. To execute this operation, the sim<sub>--</sub> video operation, the user issues an explicit command by pressing the sim<sub>--</sub> video key (Alt-F6).</p>
    <p>The sim<sub>--</sub> video operation displays records from assigned case<sub>--</sub> db files in the order indicated by a selected field, the index field. The computer screen only displays as many records as fit according to its dimensions.</p>
    <p>The index fields of several records may have the same value. If this happens, the sim<sub>--</sub> video operation displays these records in the order in which their case<sub>--</sub> db files were assigned to the col<sub>--</sub> prog window.</p>
    <p>While executing an application for the special case of a financial model, the sim<sub>--</sub> video operation would follow these steps:</p>
    <p>Each case--db file contains one set of financial forecasts for the firm.</p>
    <p>Several case<sub>--</sub> db files are created, to represent several possible scenarios for the future of the firm.</p>
    <p>Each case<sub>--</sub> db record represents the financial information for a particular point in time.</p>
    <p>Consecutive records correspond to consecutive periods.</p>
    <p>The date field is the index field in a case<sub>--</sub> db record needed for the sim<sub>--</sub> video operation.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the sim<sub>--</sub> video operation displays all records with the same date simultaneously and side-to-side. The record that appears left-most belongs to the scenario that was assigned first to the col<sub>--</sub> prog window.</p>
    <heading>Operational Codes</heading> <p>Database files being used by the invention may contain special operational codes. These codes can control the operation of specific database fields or spreadsheet cells. In financial applications developed using the invention, each case<sub>--</sub> db record may represent financial results for a particular period. Each field in a case<sub>--</sub> db record may represent a financial concept such as sales or cash flow level. Here, operational codes can be used to allow the results of a financial application to be calculated and expressed in different currencies, as required by the user. These operations do not change formulas in the spreadsheet environment. A particular operational code may identify the currency used as the field's unit of measure, while another may identify the exchange rate. Specific instructions associated with op<sub>--</sub> codes execute all exchange currency conversions.</p>
    <p>Uses and applications of operational codes are not limited to the example presented above. Operational codes expand the power and flexibility of the invention's programmability for all kinds of applications.</p>
    <heading>Multi-record Database Operations</heading> <p>In the preferred embodiment implementation, some formulas in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range may access data from different records in the same database file. These formulas are expressed in terms of special database read and write functions. Some examples are:</p>
    <p>@DB<sub>--</sub> SUM, a read function that calculates the sum of a several record fields' contents</p>
    <p>@DB<sub>--</sub> GROW, a write function that calculates an increase over a sequence of record fields' contents, according to a constant growth rate (used in time-based applications)</p>
    <p>@DB<sub>--</sub> SPREAD, a write function that distributes an original amount over a sequence of record fields (where each record corresponds to a single time period).</p>
    <heading>Relational Databases</heading> <p>The invention can be extended to operate with relational databases. This concept adds powerful advantages to the invention. This is proven by the growth of the relational database application market.</p>
    <p>The description in this document considers the definition of only one col<sub>--</sub> prog window. Yet, the preferred embodiment implementation can define and activate several col<sub>--</sub> prog windows simultaneously in a single spreadsheet application. The col<sub>--</sub> prog range in each col<sub>--</sub> prog window accesses its corresponding active case<sub>--</sub> db file.</p>
    <p>Through these operations, and through the coordination of a central program, the col<sub>--</sub> prog windows and the case<sub>--</sub> db files can compose a relational database system. (See FIG. 14.) The user develops this program in the layout environment of the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section. Thus, in this invention, the user can access relational database components, view them on a single screen and operate on their contents with spreadsheet flexibility.</p>
    <heading>Development of the Application Environment</heading> <p>As already described, the layout environment is an enhanced spreadsheet environment. The programmer may use a special command set, called the layout command, to define the tools available to the user for the operation of the application environment. Thus, the application environment comprises the tools that have been defined in the layout environment. In the preferred embodiment implementation, these are the only tools and operations available to the user in the application environment.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment implementation, the layout command can define the following tools of the application environment:</p>
    <p>Application screens: The programmer defines all screens by associating them to a spreadsheet range. To identify a screen that must operate in the col<sub>--</sub> prog environment, a range that is a strict subset of a col<sub>--</sub> prog range must be selected.</p>
    <p>Menus: The programmer defines menus by filling the blanks in a special list of options in the layout environment. All menu options call other menus or application screens (identified by their corresponding cell ranges).</p>
    <p>Programming: Routines from a procedural programming language can be linked to application screens.</p>
    <p>Context-sensitive Help Screens: The programmer uses a text editor in the layout environment to develop help text.</p>
    <p>Data input validation: Data input validation conditions are associated with defined data cells in the gen<sub>--</sub> prog section. These conditions include range and type checking of data input.</p>
    <heading>Turing Machine Emulation (Automata Theory)</heading> <p>The invention can operate as the software equivalent of a hardware parallel processor for several Turing machines. Additionally, some tools of the invention can make it operate more efficiently than parallel Turing machines. Since any computation or recognition problem for which there is a known informal algorithm can be handled by a Turing machine, therefore, the invention can handle and solve all sorts of programming problems.</p>
    <p>In the invention, each field in a case<sub>--</sub> db record may contain data, text, or formulas. If a particular field contains formulas in spreadsheet format, each read operation will load these formulas in the col<sub>--</sub> prog range. The spreadsheet calc operation will produce the expected results, given the formulas' syntax.</p>
    <p>For the invention to emulate a set of Turing machines, a minimum of two col<sub>--</sub> prog windows may operate simultaneously, and at least one of them must read and write formulas in its active case<sub>--</sub> db file. This is the software equivalent of a hardware parallel processor for a number of Turing machines. Each col<sub>--</sub> prog range's cell corresponds to a single processor in the parallel system's hardware. All data and results may be processed in a case<sub>--</sub> db file and col<sub>--</sub> prog window different from that which is used to process formulas.</p>
    <p>There is considerable evidence that the partial functions computed by languages, which are recognized by Turing machines, are exactly those recognized by informal effective procedures or algorithms. Thus, as mentioned previously, any computation or recognition problem for which there is a known informal algorithm can be handled by a Turing machine.</p>
    <p>The problem of efficiency associated to Turing machines can also be solved with this invention. (This problem refers to the conclusion that some Turing machine computations may require an inordinately large measure of tape.)</p>
    <p>The order in which the case<sub>--</sub> db records are read may be controlled by a procedural language. Also, it is possible to organize case<sub>--</sub> db records by filtering, indexing, and sorting them according to their associated indexes. In any of these ways, it is possible to control a three-level algorithm, described as follows:</p>
    <p>1) first level, procedural language;</p>
    <p>2) second level, formulas in the case<sub>--</sub> db records; and</p>
    <p>3) third level, formulas in the spreadsheet storage area.</p>
    <p>This produces an efficient instrument for the development and operation of any computation or recognition problem.</p>
    <heading>Ramifications and Scope of Invention</heading> <p>While the previous description contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred implementation thereof. The following paragraphs explain many other alternative schemes for special structures that relate to the operation of the col<sub>--</sub> prog window and col<sub>--</sub> prog environment with the active case<sub>--</sub> db files. Alternative implementation schemes are described for each of the structures, identified `A` to `D`.</p>
    <p>A. The col--prog range cells may be organized in two different ways:</p>
    <p>a) Each col--prog range may consist of a single column of spreadsheet cells. This interpretation corresponds to the best mode implementation.</p>
    <p>b) Each col--prog range may be an ordered set of disjoint spreadsheet cells.</p>
    <p>B. The relationship between the spreadsheet's col--prog range and the database files may operate as follows:</p>
    <p>a) Each read and write operation, to and from the col--prog range, is performed on one database record at a time.</p>
    <p>This is the best mode implementation, which is adequate for applications with a large number of records, each with few fields. An example is an inventory analysis program, where each record represents a single product. The fields contain past sales volume information, price, inventories, etc. This implementation is appropriate for any scenario that requires efficient reading and writing to one database record.</p>
    <p>b) The spreadsheet interacts with all records of a database file at a time, by accessing the same field in each record. Each read and write operation to and from the col--prog range is performed on only one field in every record.</p>
    <p>This is suitable for applications with very few records, each with many fields. An example is a financial model of a firm, with many accounts (fields in a record), and few periods (records) to be simulated and/or stored as history.</p>
    <p>C. Information may be transferred back and forth through the link between spreadsheet and the database as follows:</p>
    <p>a) One database record at a time; this is the best mode implementation as described.</p>
    <p>b) A subset of database file records is substituted into a spreadsheet range. Spreadsheet operations are executed one column on one record at a time. This is the idea behind some spreadsheet database tools, which execute all query operations in the spreadsheet storage area.</p>
    <p>c) Information is transferred back and forth between the database files and the col--prog range, through an intermediate storage area. An example is the use of main memory as buffer memory for communication. This implementation may accelerate the performance of slow computer disk drives.</p>
    <p>D. Particular implementations may have the following requirements:</p>
    <p>a) Independent database records.</p>
    <p>b) Each database record contains the information corresponding to a single time period.</p>
    <p>This is the case of most financial models: the results corresponding to each period depend on the values of the previous period. These applications involve an additional set of spreadsheet cells, called col--prev range. A col--prev range is associated with each col--prog range. A col--prev range contains data from the period previous to the col--prog range period.</p>
    <p>E. A separate storage area and a separate environment area may be created to store and operate elements similar to those defined in the col--prog window. Also, they may be used to implement operations similar to those described for the col--prog environment.</p>
    <p>Said separate environment contains commands and operations for the access and operation of information in the case--db files and said separate information storage area. Said separate environment can integrate the operation of data stored in the gen--prog section with data stored in said separate storage area by the use of formulas, in a similar manner to formulas used in a spreadsheet environment.</p>
    <p>However, said separate environment does not inherit all the characteristics and basic commands from the parent environment (layout or application environment), since there is not a parent environment to inherit from, nor is the data structure compatible with that operated by the layout or application environments.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents. ##SPC1##</p>
