In an embodiment, the device also includes a completely-in-canal (CIC) component, shaped to fit into the ear canal of the user such that it touches the bony portion of the ear canal. In some embodiments, the CIC component includes either a universal fit or a custom fit ear mold. The custom fit ear mold can be fabricated using a rapid prototyping technology, in which the contours of the user's ear canal are scanned, and the scan data is used either directly or indirectly to replicate the ear canal contours of that user into the custom fit ear mold. In some embodiments, the ear mold is detachably interconnected with a speaker module, preferably using either an intermediate sleeve or a detachable locking pin assembly. In another embodiment, the speaker module is permanently encapsulated within the ear mold.</div>

    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a Continuation-in-Part claiming priority benefit of co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/927,891 entitled “A BTE/CIC AUDITORY DEVICE AND MODULAR CONNECTOR SYSTEM THEREFOR,” filed Aug. 10, 2001, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention relates generally to auditory devices, and particularly to a hybrid behind-the-ear (BTE)/completely-in-canal (CIC) auditory device and a modular connector system therefor.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Conventional earpiece auditory devices (e.g., earphones, headphones, headsets, monitors, IFB devices, hearing aids, earplugs, etc.) are often bulky and uncomfortable for a user to wear. In addition, typically, these devices are cosmetically undesirable. For example, generally, use of one of these conventional devices may be easily discovered through casual observation of the user. However, in some circumstances, users may not want others to know they are using an earpiece auditory device. For example, oftentimes hearing aid users do not want others to know they are using such devices. As another example, news anchors using IFB devices may not want the device to be seen on camera. Moreover, use of a bulky and noticeable earpiece auditory device may potentially have more serious consequences. For example, a bulky, noticeable earpiece auditory device may put plain-clothed security personnel at risk of being discovered.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">To overcome these problems, earpiece auditory devices have been developed wherein the entire device may be placed behind the ear of the user or within the ear of the user. However such devices, although possibly reducing some of the conspicuousness of the device, create their own set of problems.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">For example, placing an auditory device within the outer portion of an ear canal of a user may cause the user to experience the occlusion effect, which is a plugged sensation that results when the ear canal is blocked and air conduction is impeded by the introduction of at least a portion of an earpiece auditory device into the outer portion of the ear canal. The ear canal (sometimes referred to as the external auditory meatus) has two zones: an outer zone and an inner zone. The outer zone, sometimes referred to as the cartilaginous region, makes up approximately two-thirds of the total length of the ear canal. The inner zone, referred to as the bony portion, accounts for the remaining one third of the length of the ear canal. The earlier mentioned plugged sensation is the result of the acoustic energy created by the vibration of the walls of the outer portion of the ear canal in response to a bone conducted signal. H. Gustav Mueller, “CIC Hearing Aids” What Is Their Impact On The Occlusion Effect?”, <i>The Hearing Journal</i>, Vol. 47, No. 11, p. 29–35 (November 1994). This energy typically escapes when the ear canal is at least partially open. However, unfortunately, when an earpiece auditory device of sufficient size is placed in the outer portion of the ear canal, at least a portion of this energy is trapped in the user's ear, thereby causing the above described plugged sensation. In some existing earpiece auditory devices, a vent(s) or other means whereby bone-conducted energy may escape the ear canal is provided (e.g., the device is designed to leave the ear canal at least partially open), thereby minimizing or even eliminating the occlusion effect.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">In addition, certain of the existing earpiece auditory devices (of both the behind the ear and within the ear or ear canal varieties) experience feedback problems. For example, some conventional earpiece auditory devices are designed with a microphone and speaker mounted to the same housing. As a result of such a design, the microphone and speaker are mechanically coupled to each other. One notably undesirable consequence of this mechanical coupling is electroacoustic feedback. Furthermore, in some conventional earpiece auditory devices, irrespective of the mounting of such components, a microphone and speaker of the device are situated in such close proximity to each other that feedback occurs. The above discussed feedback problems increase as the gain of the auditory device increases. As a result, the gain of such auditory devices are limited by the electroacoustic feedback.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">In the past, efforts have been made to reduce such electroacoustic feedback by, e.g., physically separating the microphone and the speaker used in such devices. For example, <i>The Volta Review </i>January 1980, pp. 40–44, describes a hearing aid in which the receiver is separated from the main body of the aid and mounted in an ear mold that in turn is placed in the user's ear.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">While such a design may result in reduced electroacoustic feedback, it would be commercially unacceptable. One reason for this is, similar to earlier discussions, the user will experience the occlusion effect on account of the introduction of the ear mold into the outer portion of the user's ear canal.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In addition to the above, existing earpiece auditory devices are typically designed such that the electrical components of the device (e.g, the speaker, receiver, microphone, etc., or whichever of such components are included in the particular device) are coupled to each other via some fixed connection. For example, in at least one instance, a speaker of an earpiece auditory device is electrically coupled (either directly or indirectly) to a microphone, processing circuitry, and/or a transceiver of a device via some form of fixed wiring. Such fixed wiring is typically done because of the protection from moisture or other undesirable elements that such fixed wiring normally provides to electrical couplings. In addition, fixed wiring is used because it occupies little of the scarce device space.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">However, as a result of such fixed couplings, assembly of the devices and/or replacement of defective or expired parts is normally costly, time-consuming, and/or burdensome. To illustrate, currently, when some element of an earpiece auditory device needs to be replaced (e.g., a part has expired or is defective), in most circumstances, the user must return the device to the manufacturer or send the device to a repair lab.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Moreover, in some circumstances, at the manufacturer or the repair lab, the device must be taken apart, the defective or expired part(s) carefully removed, and a replacement part or parts inserted into the device and fixed (e.g., soldered) into place. Under such a process, it is usually several days or weeks before the auditory device is returned to the user.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In addition, for some earpiece auditory devices (e.g., some hearing aids, some ear plugs), at least a portion of the earpiece auditory device is normally manufactured to the specific dimensions of a particular user's ear structure and/or the user's intended use for the earpiece auditory device, as determined during a fitting of the user by a technician, representative, salesperson, etc. Although there are some advantages to this procedure (e.g., providing a desired fit to a particular user), one notable disadvantage to customizing these devices in this manner, at least to a manufacturer, is that such devices can then not be mass produced.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">Furthermore, another disadvantage of this customizing of portions of earpiece auditory devices to a particular customer's ear shape is that if, upon delivery to the user, it is discovered that the fit of the auditory device is deficient in some manner, as was the case with replacing defective or expired parts, replacement of the ill-fitting earpiece is costly, time-consuming, and burdensome.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0015">The present invention is directed to an earpiece auditory device. In one embodiment, the earpiece auditory device includes a behind-the-ear (BTE) component, preferably being shaped to fit behind an ear of a user. In some embodiments, the BTE component includes processing circuitry. In a preferred embodiment, the earpiece auditory device also includes a completely-in-canal (CIC) component, preferably being shaped to fit into the ear canal of the user in such a manner as to touch the bony portion of the ear canal.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">In some embodiments, the CIC component includes either a universal fit or a custom fit ear mold. The custom fit ear mold can be fabricated using a rapid prototyping technology, in which the contours of the user's ear canal are scanned, and the scan data is used either directly or indirectly to replicate the contours of that particular user into the custom fit ear mold. In some embodiments, the ear mold is detachably interconnected with a speaker module, preferably using either a latching sleeve or a detachable locking pin arrangement. In another embodiment, the speaker module is permanently encapsulated within the ear mold. Moreover, in one embodiment, the earpiece auditory device includes a connector physically coupling the BTE component to the CIC component. In some implementations, the connector includes at least one end detachably coupled to the behind-the-ear component or the completely-in-canal component.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Technical advantages of embodiments of the present invention include ease of assembly, disassembly, reassembly, and/or the like, for an earpiece auditory device that reduces feedback, as well as the occlusion effect.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0041">The inventors of commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,606,621 issued Feb. 27, 1997, entitled “HYBRID BEHIND-THE-EAR AND COMPLETELY-IN-CANAL HEARING AID,” the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, developed a hybrid behind-the-ear (“BTE”)/completely-in-canal (CIC) hearing aid. In one embodiment, the hearing aid of the '621 application has two components: a BTE component and a CIC component. Preferably, these components are mechanically isolated from each other. The BTE component, which is worn behind the ear, preferably includes at least a microphone. In one embodiment, the BTE also includes a power source, and sound processing circuitry (e.g., amplifiers, compressors, filters, etc.). Meanwhile, the CIC component is preferably shaped to fit into the ear canal of the patient in such a manner as to touch the bony portion of the ear canal. In one embodiment, the CIC component contains a speaker, the speaker preferably being operatively connected to the sound processing circuitry of the BTE component. In a preferred embodiment of the '621 application, because the BTE and CIC components are mechanically isolated from each other, electroacoustic feedback is greatly reduced. Additionally, because in a preferred embodiment, the CIC component is located so deep in the patient's ear canal as to touch the bony portion, the hearing aid does not cause the patient to experience the occlusion effect.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">A preferred embodiment of the present invention expands upon the design of the hearing aid(s) disclosed in the '621 application. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an exploded isometric view of an exemplary embodiment of a BTE/CIC earpiece auditory device of the present invention. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, earpiece auditory device <b>40</b> includes completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b>, connector <b>20</b>, and behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b>. Preferably, when in use, behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b> is placed behind an ear of a user, while completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> is inserted so deep into the user's ear canal as to touch the bony portion of the ear canal.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">According to the illustrated embodiment, completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> includes ear mold <b>11</b>. Preferably, ear mold <b>11</b> is at least partially hollow on the inside. In one embodiment, completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> also includes speaker receiving member <b>12</b>, preferably at a first end of mold <b>11</b>. Speaker receiving member <b>12</b> may be part of ear mold <b>11</b> itself or may be attached thereto (e.g., through an adhesive, screws, a detachable coupling, or some other fastening means). In some embodiments, receiving member <b>12</b> comprises a plate that includes opening <b>18</b>. Furthermore, in one embodiment, member <b>12</b> also includes one or more speaker fastening grooves (e.g, groove <b>16</b>). In addition to or in lieu of the above, in some embodiments, speaker receiving member <b>12</b> includes one or more mounting holes for receiving screws and/or other fastening means (e.g., mounting hole <b>9</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0044">Ear mold <b>11</b> and/or speaker receiving member <b>12</b> may be made from hard material (e.g., acrylics), soft material (e.g., silicones or foam material), or some combination thereof. In one embodiment where mold <b>11</b> is made from hard material, at least a portion of the mold is covered with a foam boot or slip. The foam boot or slip may be fastened to mold <b>11</b> by numerous fastening means to include an adhesive, friction, screws, etc. Receiving member <b>12</b> may be made from the same or different material than that of ear mold <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">The illustrated size and shape of ear mold <b>11</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is by way of example only, for ear mold <b>11</b> may be of various different sizes and shapes, to include the dimensions of a particular user's ear (e.g., the ear mold may be customized/tailored to a particular user). Ear mold <b>11</b> may also be such that it provides a universal fit that is satisfactory for a number of users. For example, at least a portion of mold <b>11</b> may be made from foam (or similar material) or covered with a foam slip (or like component), either of which is able to change shape (e.g., expand, compress, deform) to meet the dimensions of the user's inner and/or outer ear. In addition, ear mold <b>11</b> may be transparent, translucent, or opaque, or some combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">In a preferred embodiment, ear mold <b>11</b> is of a particular size and shape such that completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> may be placed so deep into a user's ear canal as to touch the bony portion of the user's hearing canal. In one embodiment, the ability to produce a completely-in-canal unit of a sufficient size to place the unit so deep into the user's ear canal as to touch the bony portion is facilitated, at least in part, by limiting the number of elements included in completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">Moreover, in a preferred embodiment, in addition to ear mold <b>11</b>, completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> includes speaker <b>13</b>. Any speaker suitable for use in an earpiece auditory device may be used as speaker <b>13</b> (e.g., earpiece device speakers available from Knowles Electronics, Inc.). It will be appreciated that the speaker of an earpiece auditory device is also known in the art as a “receiver”. The term “speaker” is used here to avoid confusion with other possible components of device <b>40</b> described in detail below.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">In some embodiments, in addition to the above, completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> includes speaker fastener <b>14</b>. Speaker fastener <b>14</b> may be made from any one of numerous suitable materials to include plastics and/or metals. In one embodiment, speaker fastener <b>14</b> includes one or more projections (e.g., projection <b>15</b>). Moreover, in some embodiments, one or more of the projections of speaker fastener <b>14</b> include appendage <b>19</b>. Furthermore, in one embodiment, in addition to or in lieu of the above, speaker fastener <b>14</b> includes one or more mounting holes (e.g., mounting hole <b>8</b>) for securing speaker fastener <b>14</b> to ear mold <b>11</b> and/or receiving member <b>12</b> using screws or other fastening means.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">In a preferred embodiment, the configuration of fastener <b>14</b> is such that at least a portion of speaker <b>13</b> fits within an area, at least partially, defined by fastener <b>14</b>. For example, in one embodiment, as part of assembling device <b>40</b>, speaker <b>13</b> is, at least partially, disposed within space <b>17</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As can be in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, space <b>17</b> is, at least partially, defined by a surface of speaker fastener <b>14</b>. In the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the projection(s) of fastener <b>14</b> may help guide speaker <b>13</b> into space <b>17</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">In some embodiments, speaker <b>13</b> is communicatively (e.g., electrically) and/or physically coupled to speaker fastener <b>14</b>. Speaker <b>13</b> and fastener <b>14</b> may be fixedly coupled, such as the hard-wire coupling depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. On the other hand, speaker <b>13</b> and fastener <b>14</b> may be detachably coupled, e.g., through the detachable electrical hole and prong arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In some embodiments (e.g., the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>), at least a portion of speaker fastener <b>14</b> acts as a guard to protect the communicative coupling between speaker <b>13</b> and speaker fastener <b>14</b> from one or more undesirable elements (e.g., cerumen, moisture, and the like) that may be present in the environment in which speaker <b>13</b> and fastener <b>14</b> are used. Accordingly, preferably in such embodiments, speaker fastener <b>14</b> facilitates an insulated communicative coupling between speaker <b>13</b> and fastener <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">As mentioned, preferably, ear mold <b>11</b> is at least partially hollow on the inside. Accordingly, in one embodiment, ear mold <b>11</b> may receive internally one or more other elements of device <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, at least a portion of speaker fastener <b>14</b>, along with speaker <b>13</b>, which may be partially disposed therein, are passed through opening <b>18</b> in receiving member <b>12</b> and into ear mold <b>11</b> (e.g., the assembled portion of device <b>40</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Similar to earlier discussions, in a preferred embodiment, speaker <b>13</b> and/or speaker fastener <b>14</b> are of a particular size and shape such that when speaker <b>13</b> and/or speaker fastener <b>14</b> are coupled to ear mold <b>11</b>, the assembly of ear mold <b>11</b>, speaker <b>13</b>, and/or speaker fastener <b>14</b> may be placed so deep into a user's ear canal as to touch the bony portion of the user's ear canal.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Moreover, in one embodiment, speaker fastener <b>14</b> and/or speaker <b>13</b>, are securely (and, in one embodiment, detachably) coupled to ear mold <b>11</b> and/or receiving member <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, such a secure (preferably detachable) connection is facilitated by the projection(s) of fastener <b>14</b> engaging the fastening groove(s) of receiving member <b>12</b>. In one of these embodiments, appendage <b>19</b> of the projection(s) engages the fastening groove(s). In addition to or in lieu of the above, speaker fastener <b>14</b> and/or speaker <b>13</b> may be secured to ear mold <b>11</b> and/or speaker receiving member <b>12</b> by passing at least a portion of a screw(s) or other fastening means through the mounting holes of receiving member <b>12</b> and speaker fastener <b>14</b> (e.g., the assembled portion of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In a preferred embodiment, the coupling between fastener <b>14</b>, ear mold <b>11</b>, and/or receiving member <b>12</b> is of sufficient strength such that unit <b>10</b> may be removed from the user's ear canal by pulling on connector <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">Accordingly, speaker <b>13</b>, fastener <b>14</b>, receiving member <b>12</b>, and/or ear mold <b>11</b> can be securely fastened together. However, in some embodiments, some or all of these elements can also be conveniently attached to and detached from each other, thus allowing for convenient and easy assembly and/or disassembly of earpiece device <b>40</b>, as well as allowing for the replacement of any inoperative, defective, or otherwise unsatisfactory parts with relative ease.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">For instance, if speaker <b>13</b> fails for some reason (e.g., speaker <b>13</b> is defective or the speaker simply becomes inoperative (a common earpiece auditory device malady)), in one embodiment, connector plate <b>14</b>, with speaker <b>13</b> disposed therein, may be detached from ear mold <b>11</b>, e.g., by depressing portions of ear mold <b>11</b>, member <b>12</b>, and/or fastener <b>14</b>, thereby releasing the appendages of fastener <b>14</b>, and pulling fastener <b>14</b> from ear mold <b>11</b>. In addition to or in lieu of the above, in one embodiment, speaker connector plate <b>14</b> is detached from ear mold <b>11</b> and/or receiving member <b>12</b> by removing screws coupling fastener <b>14</b> to receiving member <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">Furthermore, in one embodiment, after its removal from the inside of mold <b>11</b>, speaker <b>13</b> may be separated from fastener <b>14</b> through the application of a pulling force (e.g., where speaker <b>13</b> and fastener <b>14</b> are coupled via a hole and prong arrangement). Thereafter, in one embodiment, the replacement speaker may be coupled to fastener <b>14</b> by pressing the electrical prongs of fastener <b>14</b> into the receiving holes of the replacement speaker (or vice versa). Then, in some embodiments, speaker fastener <b>14</b>, and the attached replacement speaker, may be passed through receiving member <b>12</b> until the appendages of fastener <b>14</b> engage the grooves of receiving member <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">In one embodiment, completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> has an open mold configuration, meaning the ear canal of a user is at least partially open when completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> is inserted so deep into the user's ear canal as to touch the bony portion. Moreover, in some embodiments, completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> (e.g., ear mold <b>11</b>) includes a vent(s) by which sound waves may pass over and/or through unit <b>10</b>. In an embodiment of completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> wherein unit <b>10</b> includes a vent(s), unit <b>10</b> also includes a filter to keep cerumen, dirt, moisture, and other undesirable elements from entering unit <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">Furthermore, in one embodiment, the dimensions of a surface of receiving member <b>12</b> are such that member <b>12</b> may be flush with a surface of ear mold <b>11</b> (as an example, the assembled portion of device <b>40</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Moreover, in one embodiment, at least one dimension of receiving member <b>12</b> is initially larger, in some instances substantially larger, than a dimension of ear mold <b>11</b> (an example of such a receiving member is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Then, as part of the assembly of device <b>40</b> in such embodiments, speaker receiving plate <b>12</b> is ground down or otherwise reduced in size, so as to be flush with a surface of ear mold <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">The size and shape of the elements of unit <b>10</b>, as well as the arrangement of the elements, depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are by way of example only, for the elements may be of a different size and shape, as well as arranged in a manner different from that which is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Moreover, elements not depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be included in unit <b>10</b>. For example, in one embodiment speaker fastener <b>14</b> or receiving member <b>12</b> includes a retrieval line for aiding a user in retrieving and/or inserting unit <b>10</b> into and out of the user's ear canal. Furthermore, elements included in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be absent from unit <b>10</b>. For example, in one embodiment, at least one of the elements of completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is included as part of connector <b>20</b>, behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b>, and/or some portion of device <b>40</b> other than completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b>. For instance, in some embodiments, speaker fastener <b>14</b> is part of connector <b>20</b>, rather than unit <b>10</b>. In addition to or in lieu of the above, in one embodiment, speaker <b>13</b> is part of connector <b>20</b>, rather than unit <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">In a preferred embodiment, in addition to completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b>, earpiece auditory device <b>40</b> includes behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b>. In a preferred embodiment, unit <b>30</b> includes processing module <b>33</b>. In one embodiment, module <b>33</b> includes housing <b>37</b> (housing <b>37</b> preferably being made from plastic). Furthermore, in some embodiments, module <b>33</b> includes at least one or some combination of a microphone(s), a communications link(s), processing circuitry (which may include sound processing circuitry), and/or a power source. Preferably, the above described elements of module <b>33</b> are integrated with housing <b>37</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">Any microphone suitable for use in an earpiece auditory device may be employed as the microphone(s) in embodiments of module <b>33</b> (e.g., microphones available from Knowles Electronics, Inc.). Moreover, the microphone(s) may be either omni, directional, or some combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">In addition, the earlier mentioned processing circuitry (which, in one embodiment, includes sound processing circuitry) may include any and all hardware, software, firmware, and/or the like, necessary for the intended operation of the earpiece auditory device. As non-limiting examples, the processing circuitry may include an amplifier(s) (in one embodiment, multi-channel and programmable), compressor(s), filter(s), packetizing circuitry, depacketizing circuitry, modulation circuitry, conversion circuitry, and/or the like. Such circuitry may include analog, programmable analog, digital circuitry, and/or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the processing circuitry processes electrical (and/or other) signals that are to be provided to speaker <b>13</b>, where the signals are converted to acoustic waves. In addition to or in lieu of the above, in one embodiment, the processing circuitry processes electrical (and/or other signals) for transmission (be it wireline or wireless) to a remote device(s).</p>
    <p num="p-0062">Moreover, in a preferred embodiment, the earlier mentioned communications link enables device <b>40</b> to communicate with a remote device (e.g., via wireline and/or wireless transmissions). In one embodiment, the communications link includes a wireless input receiver for receiving wireless transmissions (e.g., a radio frequency (RF) receiver or a magnetic induction coil), a transmitter for broadcasting wireless transmissions, and/or combinations thereof (e.g., a transceiver). These wireless transmissions may be radio RF transmissions, optical transmissions (e.g., infrared), magnetic induction transmissions, acoustic waves (e.g., ultrasonic), capacitive coupling transmissions, as well as other forms of wireless communications. In some embodiments, the wireless receiver, transmitter, etc., of the communications link includes accompanying circuitry.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">With respect to the above discussed power source, in one embodiment, the power source of module <b>33</b> is a battery. In some embodiments, the power source of module <b>33</b> is re-chargeable. Furthermore, in one embodiment, the power source is external to module <b>33</b> (e.g., an adapter).</p>
    <p num="p-0064">Preferably, the particular element or combination of elements that is included as part of a particular embodiment of module <b>33</b>, as well as the make up of each element, depends upon the intended use of the particular embodiment of earpiece auditory device <b>40</b>. For example, when earpiece auditory device <b>40</b> is to be used to convert acoustic waves from the user's environment into representations of the acoustic waves via electrical (and/or other) signals, whereby the signals are then processed and provided to speaker <b>13</b> (e.g. when device <b>40</b> is to be used as a hearing aid), module <b>33</b> preferably includes at least a microphone(s), processing circuitry, and a power source.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">An example of such an embodiment of module <b>33</b> is provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. As illustrated, at least a portion of the interior of module <b>33</b> includes a connector <b>60</b> for communicatively (preferably detachably) and/or physically coupling module <b>33</b> to module fastener <b>31</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and/or connector <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, such a communicative coupling is an electrical coupling. Preferably, connector <b>60</b> is communicatively (e.g., electrically) coupled to processing circuitry <b>61</b>, which may include sound processing circuitry. In one embodiment, processing circuitry <b>61</b> is also communicatively coupled to microphone <b>62</b>. Preferably, shuttle <b>33</b> also includes power source <b>63</b> (e.g., a battery).</p>
    <p num="p-0066">In some of the above discussed embodiments, the sound processing circuitry of processing circuitry <b>61</b> includes high gain circuitry. However, in some embodiments, the sound processing circuitry may be low or no gain circuitry. Moreover, in some of the above embodiments, device <b>40</b> may amplify some sounds, while allowing other sounds to be provided to speaker <b>13</b> without amplification. Furthermore, in one embodiment, device <b>40</b> may allow some sounds to be provided directly to the user's ear drum without first being converted into electrical (and/or other) signals (e.g., the earpiece device is an open mold configuration and/or includes a vent(s)).</p>
    <p num="p-0067">Furthermore, in one embodiment, the sound processing circuitry of module <b>33</b> includes sound amplitude reduction circuitry. For example, in some embodiments, earpiece auditory device <b>40</b> may be used as an electronic earplug or other sound reduction device. In one of these embodiments, module <b>33</b> includes sound amplitude reduction circuitry whereby sounds received at the microphone are reduced (sometimes greatly reduced) in volume before being provided to speaker <b>13</b>, if such sounds are not eliminated altogether by the circuitry. Moreover, in one of these sound reduction embodiments, device <b>40</b> may reduce the volume or eliminate certain sounds, while allowing other sounds to be provided to speaker <b>13</b> or directly to the user's ear drum (e.g., the earpiece device is an open mold configuration and/or includes a vent(s)).</p>
    <p num="p-0068">In embodiments where earpiece auditory device <b>40</b> is to be used in a manner wherein electrical and/or other signals are to be directly inputted (either by wired or wireless transmissions) to device <b>40</b> and/or transmitted by device <b>40</b> (in wired or wireless form), e.g., when used as an earphone, monitor, or IFB device, module <b>33</b> preferably includes at least the earlier mentioned communications link, processing circuitry, and a power source. In one of these embodiments, the sound processing circuitry included in the processing circuitry of module <b>33</b> is high gain, low gain, no gain, and/or sound reduction circuitry.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">An example of such an embodiment of module <b>33</b> is provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. As illustrated, at least a portion of the internal elements of module <b>33</b> includes connector <b>60</b> for communicatively (preferably detachably) and/or physically coupling module <b>33</b> to module fastener <b>31</b> and/or connector <b>20</b>. Similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, in one embodiment, connector <b>60</b> is communicatively (e.g., electrically) coupled to processing circuitry <b>61</b>, which may include sound processing circuitry. However, rather than being coupled to a microphone as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, circuitry <b>61</b> is communicatively coupled to communications link <b>64</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, shuttle <b>33</b> also includes power source <b>63</b> (e.g., a battery).</p>
    <p num="p-0070">Furthermore, in embodiments where device <b>40</b> is to be used to receive and/or transmit data or other transmissions via a wired or wireless means to and/or from a remote device, e.g., a computer device (such as audio files, MP3 files, voice streams, video streams, Internet broadcasts, etc.) and/or a cell phone, preferably the communications link and/or processing circuitry of shuttle <b>33</b> is compliant with the various transmission formats, protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, Bluetooth), and/or interfaces necessary to receive and process the transmissions.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">Moreover, in some embodiments, device <b>40</b> may be used to directly receive and/or transmit electrical (and/or other) signals, as well as convert acoustic waves into electrical (and/or other) signals. For example, in one embodiment, device <b>40</b> may convert the user's voice and/or other acoustic waves from the environment into electrical (and/or other) signals. Moreover, such signals may be processed and transmitted to speaker <b>13</b>. In addition, such signals may be processed and transmitted to a remote device(s) (e.g., a cell phone, an intercom system). Furthermore, device <b>40</b> may receive signals from the remote device(s). In one of these embodiments, at least a portion of the interior of module <b>33</b> resembles the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> with the addition of communications link <b>64</b> communicatively coupled to processing circuitry <b>61</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">Furthermore, in one embodiment, in addition to module <b>33</b>, behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b> includes module fastener <b>31</b>. In some embodiments, module fastener <b>31</b> facilitates the coupling of module <b>33</b> to connector <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, at least a portion of module fastener <b>31</b> is made from plastic. Moreover, module fastener <b>31</b> may be transparent, translucent, opaque, and/or a combination thereof. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref>, for purposes of illustration only, a portion of fastener <b>31</b> has been removed to enable the electrical prongs of one embodiment of device <b>40</b> to be seen.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">In one embodiment, when earpiece auditory device <b>40</b> is assembled, fastener <b>31</b> is securely (preferably detachably) coupled to module <b>33</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). For example, in one embodiment, fastener <b>31</b> is of such a shape that it slips over at least a portion of module <b>33</b>. Moreover, in one embodiment, fastener <b>31</b> includes one or more fastening projections (e.g, fastening projection <b>34</b>) that engage one or more fastening notches of module <b>33</b> (e.g., notch <b>35</b>) when fastener <b>31</b> is slipped over module <b>33</b> (thereby securing the attachment). In one of these embodiments, the one or more fastening projections include an appendage(s) for engaging the fastening notches. In addition to or in lieu of the above, fastener <b>31</b> may be coupled to module <b>33</b> by other means (e.g., screws, adhesives, and/or other fastening means). In a preferred embodiment, the coupling between fastener <b>31</b> and module <b>33</b> is of sufficient strength that completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> may be removed from within the user's ear canal by pulling on connector <b>20</b>, without separating fastener <b>31</b> from module <b>33</b>. Furthermore, in one embodiment, the coupling between fastener <b>31</b> and module <b>33</b> is of sufficient strength that behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b> may be removed from behind the user's ear by pulling on connector <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">In some embodiments, module <b>33</b> and fastener <b>31</b> can be detached from and/or reattached to each other. In one embodiment, this may be accomplished by depressing a surface(s) of fastener <b>31</b> and pulling the two pieces apart (e.g., an embodiment where the projection(s) of fastener <b>31</b> engage the notch(Es) of shuttle <b>33</b>). In one embodiment, module <b>33</b> may be detached from fastener <b>31</b> by removing screws coupling the two components together.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">Furthermore, in some embodiments, module <b>33</b> is communicatively (e.g., electrically) coupled to fastener <b>31</b>. In one embodiment, the communicative coupling between module <b>33</b> and fastener <b>31</b> is fixed, e.g., hard-wired. In an alternative embodiment, the communicative coupling between shuttle <b>33</b> and fastener <b>31</b> is detachable, e.g., the detachable prong and hole connection shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref>. In one embodiment where fastener <b>31</b> is communicatively coupled to module <b>33</b>, at least a portion of fastener <b>31</b> acts as a guard to protect the communicative coupling between fastener <b>31</b> and module <b>33</b> from one or more undesirable elements (e.g., moisture, dirt particles, etc.) that may be present in the environment in which unit <b>30</b> is used (e.g., the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref>). Thereby, in such embodiments, fastener <b>31</b> preferably facilitates an insulated communicative coupling between the fastener and module. Moreover, in one embodiment, the projections of fastener <b>31</b> may help align electrical prongs of fastener <b>31</b> with receptacle holes of module <b>33</b> (or vice versa).</p>
    <p num="p-0076">In addition, in some embodiments, fastener <b>31</b> includes a plurality of holes <b>36</b> that facilitate the passage of sound through fastener <b>31</b> and/or into module <b>33</b>. In some of these embodiments, a filter <b>32</b> is included within fastener <b>31</b> to prevent foreign and unwanted particles (e.g., dirt and moisture) from getting inside fastener <b>31</b> and/or passing into module <b>33</b>. In one embodiment, when the filter is no longer capable of providing satisfactory protection, the filter may be replaced by separating fastener <b>31</b> and module <b>33</b> (e.g., in the manner described above), removing the old filter from fastener <b>31</b>, and placing a new filter therein. In some embodiments, rather than being included as part of fastener <b>31</b>, filter <b>32</b> is part of module <b>33</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">Preferably, module fastener <b>31</b> and/or module <b>33</b> are shaped so as to funnel sounds into the interior of module <b>33</b>. For example, in one of the embodiments where module <b>33</b> includes a microphone, module fastener <b>31</b> and/or module <b>33</b> may be shaped so as to funnel sounds towards the microphone.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">Moreover, as mentioned, in a preferred embodiment, when in use, behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b> is placed behind the cartilage of the user's ear. In one embodiment, fastener <b>31</b> and/or module <b>33</b> are of such size and shape that they are invisible to the casual observer when placed behind the cartilage of the user's ear. In addition, in some embodiments, fastener <b>31</b> and/or module <b>33</b> includes (or forms) an earhook that enables unit <b>30</b> to sit on top of the user's ear.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">As discussed, in one embodiment, module <b>33</b> and fastener <b>31</b> can be securely fastened together. However, preferably, these individual elements can be easily detached from and reattached to each other, thus allowing for convenient assembly and disassembly, as well as replacement of any inoperative, defective, or otherwise unsatisfactory parts. For instance, if module <b>33</b> fails for some reason (e.g., moisture shorts the processing circuitry), in some embodiments, module <b>33</b> and fastener <b>31</b> can be detached from each other (in one embodiment, by depressing a surface(s) of fastener <b>31</b> and pulling the two pieces apart). A replacement module can then be selected. Afterwards, in one embodiment, fastener <b>31</b> can be coupled to the replacement module by slipping the fastener over the replacement module until the projections of fastener <b>31</b> engage the notches of the replacement module</p>
    <p num="p-0080">The dimensions and arrangement of the elements of behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is by way of example only, as the elements may be of a different size and shape, as well as arranged in a manner different from that which is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In addition, elements not depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be included in unit <b>30</b>. On the other hand, elements included in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be absent from unit <b>30</b>. Furthermore, rather than being part of unit <b>30</b>, some of the elements of unit <b>30</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may instead be part of connector <b>20</b>, speaker module <b>10</b>, or some portion of earpiece auditory device <b>40</b> other than MRP module <b>30</b>. For example, in one embodiment, fastener <b>31</b> is part of connector <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">In addition to the above, in one embodiment, connector <b>20</b> physically (preferably detachably) couples completely-in-canal-unit <b>10</b> to behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b>. In a preferred embodiment, connector <b>20</b> includes at least one end that may be detachably physically coupled to unit <b>10</b> or unit <b>30</b>. Also, in one embodiment, as part of the physical coupling of behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b> to completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b>, connector <b>20</b> communicatively (e.g., electrically) couples completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> to behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b>. Moreover, in one embodiment, at least one of the earlier mentioned one or more ends of connector <b>20</b> that may be detachably physically coupled to unit <b>10</b> or unit <b>30</b> may be detachably communicatively coupled to unit <b>10</b> or unit <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">In some embodiments, connector <b>20</b> includes hollow tubing <b>21</b> (preferably insulated and made from plastic). In one of these embodiments, wire cable(s) <b>22</b> is disposed within tubing <b>21</b>. Preferably, only two or three wire cables are disposed within tubing <b>21</b>. However, a greater or fewer number of wires can be disposed therein. For example, the processing circuitry of module <b>33</b> may require a greater or lesser number of wire cables within tubing <b>21</b>. In an alternative embodiment, unit <b>10</b> and unit <b>30</b> are communicatively coupled via a wireless connection, and thus, wire cable(s) <b>22</b> are not present. Furthermore, as discussed earlier, in some embodiments, speaker <b>13</b>, speaker fastener <b>14</b> and/or module fastener <b>31</b> are part of connector <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">Preferably, wire cable(s) <b>22</b> is communicatively (e.g., electrically) and/or physically coupled to speaker fastener <b>14</b> (e.g., coupling <b>23</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The communicative and/or physical coupling between wire cable(s) <b>22</b> and speaker fastener <b>14</b> may be fixed, such as through hard-wiring. On the other hand, the coupling between wire cable(s) <b>22</b> and speaker fastener <b>14</b> may be detachable, e.g., through a detachable electrical prong and hole arrangement.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">Similarly, in one embodiment, wire cable(s) <b>22</b> is communicatively (e.g., electrically) and/or physically coupled to module fastener <b>31</b> (e.g., coupling <b>24</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As was the case with respect to speaker fastener <b>14</b>, the communicative coupling between wire cable(s) <b>22</b> and module fastener <b>31</b> may be fixed, such as through hard-wiring. On the other hand, the communicative coupling between wire cable(s) <b>22</b> and module fastener <b>31</b> may be detachable, e.g., through a detachable prong and hole arrangement.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">In a preferred embodiment, connector <b>20</b> is of sufficient length to physically and/or communicatively couple unit <b>30</b> to unit <b>10</b> when unit <b>30</b> is placed behind-the-ear of a user and unit <b>10</b> is placed within the ear canal of a user so far as to touch the bony portion of the ear canal. Moreover, when in use, preferably a first portion of connector <b>20</b> is at least within the ear canal of the user. In some embodiments, e.g., when speaker <b>13</b> and/or speaker fastener <b>14</b> are part of connector <b>20</b>, similar to the manner discussed earlier with respect to unit <b>10</b>, a portion of connector <b>20</b> is inserted within and coupled to ear mold <b>11</b> of unit <b>10</b>, e.g., through receiving member <b>12</b> (e.g., the assembled portion of device <b>40</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Accordingly, in one embodiment, a portion of connector <b>20</b>, when in use, is part of an assembly that includes ear mold <b>11</b> and receiving member <b>12</b> of unit <b>10</b> that may be inserted so deep within the user's ear canal as to touch the bony portion. Furthermore, when in use, preferably a second portion of connector <b>20</b> is located behind the ear of the user (to include embodiments where fastener <b>31</b> is not part of connector <b>20</b>). In addition, preferably, the dimensions of connector <b>20</b> are such that those portions of connector <b>20</b> not in the bony portion or outer portion of the user's ear canal or behind the user's ear are taut against the head of the user when device <b>40</b> is in use. In a preferred embodiment, the dimensions of connector <b>20</b> are such that connector <b>20</b> is indiscernible to one casually viewing the user when device <b>40</b> is in use.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Accordingly, completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b>, connector <b>20</b>, and behind-the-ear unit <b>30</b> may be physically and/or communicatively coupled together. In a preferred embodiment, one or more of these couplings are detachable, such that, unit <b>10</b> and/or unit <b>30</b> can be easily attached to and detached from connector <b>20</b> or vice versa, thus allowing for convenient and easy assembly of auditory device <b>40</b>, as well as relatively easy replacement of any inoperative, defective, or otherwise unsatisfactory parts.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">For instance, if connector <b>20</b> is deficient for some reason (e.g., a wire has failed and/or connector <b>20</b> is too long and thus is cosmetically undesirable when the device is in use), in one embodiment, the end of connector <b>20</b> coupled to unit <b>10</b> may be easily detached (at least relatively speaking) from unit <b>10</b> by pulling the pieces apart (e.g., embodiments where connector <b>20</b> is detachably coupled to fastener <b>14</b>, such as through a hole and prong arrangement). Furthermore, in one embodiment, connector <b>20</b> may be detached from unit <b>30</b> by pulling apart a detachable coupling between connector <b>20</b> and fastener <b>31</b> (e.g., when connector <b>21</b> and fastener <b>31</b> are coupled via a hole and prong arrangement). In addition, an acceptable replacement connector may be selected. Afterwards, in one embodiment, one end of the replacement connector may be coupled to unit <b>10</b> by pushing fastener <b>14</b> and connector <b>20</b> together (e.g., a hole and prong coupling), while a second end of the replacement connector may be coupled to unit <b>30</b> by pushing connector <b>20</b> and fastener <b>31</b> together (e.g., a hole and prong coupling as well).</p>
    <p num="p-0088">In some of the embodiments where speaker fastener <b>14</b> and/or module fastener <b>31</b> are part of connector <b>20</b>, connector <b>20</b> may be separated from ear mold <b>11</b> by depressing a portion(s) of ear mold <b>11</b>, receiving member <b>12</b>, and/or fastener <b>14</b> and pulling fastener <b>14</b> from ear mold <b>11</b>. In embodiments where speaker <b>13</b> is part of unit <b>10</b>, fastener <b>14</b> may then be removed from unit <b>10</b> by pulling speaker <b>13</b> from fastener <b>14</b> (e.g., where fastener <b>14</b> and speaker <b>13</b> are coupled via a hole and prong arrangement). In addition, in one embodiment, connector <b>20</b> may be separated from unit <b>30</b> by depressing a portion(s) of fastener <b>31</b> and pulling fastener <b>31</b> from module <b>33</b>. A new connector may than be coupled (or the previous connector re-coupled) to unit <b>10</b> and/or unit <b>30</b> via one of the earlier described means for coupling fastener <b>14</b> to speaker <b>13</b> and ear mold <b>11</b> and/or coupling fastener <b>31</b> to shuttle <b>33</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">Similar to earlier discussions, in a preferred embodiment, the coupling between connector <b>20</b> and unit <b>10</b> is of sufficient strength such that unit <b>10</b> may be removed from within the user's ear canal by pulling on connector <b>20</b>. Moreover, in addition to or in lieu of the above, in one embodiment, the coupling between connector <b>20</b> and unit <b>30</b> is of sufficient strength such that unit <b>30</b> may be removed from behind the user's ear by pulling on connector <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">The size, shape, dimensions, etc., of connector <b>20</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are by way of example only, as connector <b>20</b> can be of numerous sizes and shapes.

For example, in one embodiment where speaker fastener <b>14</b> is part of connector <b>20</b>, fastener <b>14</b> includes a retrieval line for aiding a user in retrieving and/or inserting unit <b>10</b> into and out of the user's ear canal. On the other hand, elements included in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be absent from connector <b>20</b>. Moreover, as mentioned, in at least one embodiment, connector <b>20</b> includes speaker <b>13</b>, fastener <b>14</b>, and/or fastener <b>31</b>.</p>

    <p num="p-0092">As a non-limiting example of such, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref>, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C depict an alternative embodiment of earpiece auditory device <b>40</b>.

    <p num="p-0098">In various embodiments, the earpiece auditory device of the present invention overcomes the difficulties associated with prior earpiece auditory devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">With regards to the problem of bulkiness and noticeability of earlier prior art auditory devices, as previously mentioned, when in use, preferably completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> is positioned so deep inside the ear canal of a user as to touch the bony portion of the user's hearing canal. Accordingly, the unit is indiscernible to an observer. In addition, in one embodiment, fastener <b>31</b> and module <b>33</b> are of a particular size and shape such that, when placed behind the cartilage of the ear of a user, fastener <b>31</b> and module <b>33</b> are made invisible to an observer by the cartilage of the user's ear. Also as mentioned, in one embodiment, the dimensions of connector <b>20</b> are such that those portions of connector <b>20</b> not in the bony or outer portion of the user's ear canal or behind the user's ear when device <b>40</b> is in use are taut against the head of the user. Furthermore, in at least some of these embodiments, the dimensions of connector <b>20</b> are such that connector <b>20</b> is indiscernible to one casually viewing the user. Accordingly, in one embodiment, when device <b>40</b> is in use, its presence will be indiscernible to the casual observer. Therefore, the earlier problems of bulkiness and noticeability are reduced, if not alleviated, by the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">With respect to the occlusion dilemma discussed earlier, because, in one embodiment, completely-in-canal unit <b>10</b> is inserted so deep in the user's ear canal as to touch the bony portion, the device does not cause the patient to experience the occlusion effect. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention reduce the occlusion effect without having to resort to vents, open mold configurations, etc. (although vents, open molds, etc., may still be used for other purposes).</p>
    <p num="p-0101">Similarly, with regards to the feedback problems occurring with some prior art auditory devices (e.g., conventional hearing aids), in some embodiments, the microphone(s) of device <b>40</b> (or equivalent device(s)) is mechanically isolated from the speaker(s) of device <b>40</b>. Therefore, electroacoustic feedback is, at the very least, greatly reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">Accordingly, various embodiments of the present invention enable a user to have the benefit of a high-gain earpiece auditory device without the accompanying detriment of suffering from the occlusion effect.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">In addition to the above, in some embodiments, at least portions of the earpiece auditory device are protected from one or more undesirable external elements (such as moisture, cerumen, dirt, etc.) to which certain prior art devices are susceptible.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">Moreover, in one embodiment, the couplings of the earpiece auditory device do not require significant space in order to be implemented. Accordingly, significant device space and/or other limited space in around the user's ear need not be taken up by the couplings of embodiments of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">Furthermore, in one embodiment, the coupling(s) between the connector, the behind the ear component, and the completely-in-canal component is of sufficient strength that the completely-in-canal unit and behind-the-ear unit may be removed from the user's ear by pulling on the connector without any undesirable separation of the components.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">Moreover, as mentioned earlier, in a preferred embodiment, one or more portions of the earpiece auditory device may be assembled with relative ease. As a result, in one embodiment, an earpiece auditory device in accordance with the present invention may be mass produced, while at the same time provide a tailored fit to one or more users.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">For example, rather than waiting until a particular customer has been fitted, tested, etc., to manufacture an auditory device for that customer, the manufacturer(s) of at least one embodiment of an earpiece auditory device of the present invention may instead make available one or more mass produced components (and/or elements thereof) of an embodiment(s) of the earpiece auditory device. The user, or other individual, may then select from the above described components, elements, etc., those components, elements, etc., that provide the fit and functional capabilities desired by the user. The user, or other individual, may then assemble the device himself/herself.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">To illustrate, the manufacturer(s) may make available a plurality of behind-the-ear units from which a behind-the-ear unit operable to facilitate a particular user's intended use for an earpiece auditory device may be selected. This plurality of behind-the-ear units may include units of different types, shapes, sizes (e.g., so that a user may select a behind-the-ear unit that is of a particular size so that the unit is made invisible by the user's ear when placed behind the user's ear), functional capabilities (e.g., two or more of the behind-the-ear units may have different sound processing circuitry), etc. However, two or more of the behind-the-ear units may be of the same type, shape, size, functional capability, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">The manufacturer(s) preferably may also make available a plurality of one or more elements of a completely-in-canal unit (e.g., a plurality of ear molds and/or a plurality of speakers) and/or a plurality of completely-in-canal units, from which a user, or other individual, may select at least one of the elements to be included in the completely-in-canal unit of the user's device. Similar to the earlier discussion, the plurality of one or more elements includes elements of different, types, shapes, sizes (e.g., multiple pre-made sizes of ear molds), functional capabilities (e.g., the plurality of one or more elements may include two or more speakers having different speaker performance characteristics), etc. However, similar to the above discussion, in one embodiment, two or more of the earlier mentioned plurality may be of the same type, shape, size, functional capability, etc. In one embodiment, the earlier mentioned plurality may include universal-fit tips, such as the foam tips, slips, boots, etc., described earlier, to provide a desired fit for the user. Furthermore, custom-made ear molds may be included as well.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">In addition, in one embodiment, the manufacturer(s) may also make available a plurality of connectors from which a user may select a connector to couple (physically and/or communicatively) the selected behind-the-ear unit to a selected completely-in-canal component or the completely-in-canal unit that includes the one or more selected elements. In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the connectors includes at least one end operable to detachably couple (physically and/or communicatively) the connector to the selected behind-the-ear unit or completely-in-canal unit. Similar to the above discussions, the plurality of connectors may be of different types, sizes (e.g., different lengths), shapes, functional capabilities, etc. Moreover, two or more of the plurality of connectors may be of the same type, size, shape, functional capability, etc. Preferably, from the plurality of connectors, the user may select a connector of sufficient length to couple the selected behind-the-ear component, when placed behind the ear of the particular user, to the completely-in-canal unit, when placed inside the ear canal of the particular user so deep as to touch the bony portion of the user's ear canal. In another embodiment, preferably the user may select a connector of such dimensions that when in use, those portions of the connector not in the bony or outer portion of the user's ear canal or behind the user's ear are taut against the user's head.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">The above, units, elements, etc., may be offered on an individual basis or in combination with other elements, sizes, shapes, etc. (e.g., one packet may contain an ear mold of a particular shape and size, while another packet may contain ear molds of various types, shapes and sizes, while yet another packet may contain a particular length of connector, and still another packet may contain a speaker and a connector already coupled together).</p>
    <p num="p-0112">As discussed earlier, the user, or other individual, may then assemble the selected pieces together to form an earpiece auditory device fitting the user's ear structure, as well as the user's intended use for the device. Accordingly, a distributor, dispenser, or the user himself/herself, may make the initial assembly of the device, instead of the manufacturer. In addition, in one embodiment, the distributor, dispenser, user, etc., may tailor the device to fit the particular user's ear structure, as well as the user's intended use for the device, by determining which combination of the pre-made elements, sizes, shapes, etc., provides an optimal fit and operation for the particular user.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">Moreover, not only is assembly made more convenient, but disassembly, re-assembly, repair, fitting, re-fitting, etc., is made convenient as well. Preferably, as a result, the device may be repaired, etc., without the need to send the device to a repair lab or return the device to the manufacturer, thereby saving the user from the earlier described hassle associated with sending the device to the manufacturer. The same holds true with refitting the device to a particular user if the initial fit was deficient in some manner. In such instances, the distributor/dispenser and/or the user may simply experiment with the various pre-made sizes until the optimal fit for the user is found.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">Thus, preferably the present invention saves time and money for the user(s), the manufacturer(s), and/or the distributor(s)/dispenser(s). However, the manufacturer may still initially assemble the auditory devices and then make the other pre-made components commercially available for repair or replacement purposes.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">Another notable advantage is that, in various embodiments, the earpiece auditory device discussed above may be used in a variety of applications. For example, embodiments of the earpiece auditory device may be used in a manner similar to conventional hearing aids.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">In addition, embodiments of the earpiece auditory device may be used as earphones (or similar device(s)) for such electronic devices as televisions, radios, CD players, stereos, cell phones, computers (to include personal digital assistants and other processor based devices). As mentioned, in one embodiment, the earpiece auditory device may receive transmissions from and/or broadcast transmissions to a remote device(s) by wired or wireless means (e.g., radio frequency (RF) means, optical means, magnetic induction coil, etc.).</p>
    <p num="p-0117">Moreover, in at least some embodiment(s), the earpiece auditory device may receive and/or broadcast data or other transmissions (be it via wired or wireless means) to a remote device (e.g., audio files, MP3 files, voice streams, video streams, Internet broadcasts, audio e-mails, etc). The device may be complaint with the various transmission formats, protocols (to include TCP/IP, Bluetooth, etc.), and interfaces necessary to receive and/or process such transmissions.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">Embodiments of the earpiece auditory device of the present invention may also be used as monitors for recordings. For example, a musician, or other individual recording sounds, may hear sounds as they are being processed by studio equipment through an embodiment of the present inventions.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">In addition, embodiments of the earpiece auditory device may be used as IFB devices, e.g., for newscasters, whereby audio may be provided to the newscaster.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">In addition to manipulating sound in the manner described above, embodiments of the earpiece auditory device of the present invention may be used to decrease, muffle, or eliminate certain sounds. For example, as discussed earlier, in at least one embodiment the earpiece auditory device of the present invention may be used as an electronic ear plug.</p>

    <p num="p-0122">Link module <b>1220</b>, similar to connector <b>20</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A–10C</figref>, at its proximal end is detachably coupled physically and communicatively to processing module <b>110</b> using, for example, previously described module fastener <b>100</b>, to construct alternative BTE/CIC earpiece auditory device embodiment <b>1440</b>. The physical size and shape of processing module <b>110</b> are designed to fit discreetly and comfortably behind the user's ear. In some embodiments, processing module <b>110</b> incorporates at least one user-operable switch <b>1450</b>, which can control volume, change memory, and/or select the mode of operation of processing circuitry internal to processing module <b>110</b>, for example t-coil, directional microphone, wireless communication, and the like. Embodiments of interior portions of processing module <b>110</b> are described above in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A–11B</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">Similar to connector <b>20</b>, link module <b>1220</b> includes flexible tubular portion <b>1222</b>, which physically and communicatively couples BTE processing module <b>110</b> with CIC unit <b>1410</b>, functionally analogous with CIC unit <b>10</b>, described above in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Unlike connector <b>20</b>, the distal end of link module <b>1220</b> is permanently attached to speaker module <b>1212</b>, which at least partially encases speaker <b>1540</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>). In some embodiments, one end of tubular portion <b>1222</b> is communicatively coupled to speaker <b>1540</b>, e.g., by wiring connections, and then encapsulated with speaker <b>1540</b> into the shell of speaker module <b>1212</b>, e.g., using a plastic injection molding operation. The tubing material of tubular portion is typically silicone, fluorocarbon (e.g., PTFE) or similar flexible plastic material, which is attached by gluing, laser welding, or other suitable technique. Preferably speaker module <b>1212</b> is formed of a hard and rigid plastic material.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">In some embodiments, CIC unit <b>1410</b> includes a universal tip assembly, for example universal tip assembly <b>1330</b>, incorporating conventional soft umbrella tip <b>1320</b> slipped on over the tubular neck of hollow sleeve <b>1310</b>, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A–13C</figref>. Sleeve <b>1310</b> is preferably made of a soft resilient urethane or silicone type polymer material. Umbrella tip <b>1320</b> is made of a polymer material softer than that of sleeve <b>1310</b>, preferably a soft silicone or alternatively a polymer foam. Universal tips or ear molds, such as umbrella tip <b>1320</b>, are normally available in a range of sizes which are selectable to fit any ear canal.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">In one embodiment, speaker module <b>1212</b> and sleeve <b>1310</b> are configured to be releasably latched together. Speaker module <b>1212</b> and sleeve <b>1310</b> have similarly shaped cross-sections, such that speaker module <b>1212</b> is inserted into open end <b>1316</b> of sleeve <b>1310</b>. Surfaces of speaker module <b>1212</b> are appropriately tapered and/or radiused, such that they deform and pry apart the walls of sleeve <b>1310</b>. Rigid flange <b>1214</b> of speaker module <b>1212</b> slides over and outwardly deflects resilient strap <b>1314</b> of sleeve <b>1310</b>. After flange <b>1214</b> clears strap <b>1314</b>, flange <b>1214</b> engages slot <b>1312</b> of sleeve <b>1310</b>, where it is latched securely into place by resilient strap <b>1314</b>, which has elastically relaxed to its undeflected shape and position. CIC unit <b>1410</b> incorporating universal tip assembly <b>1330</b> and speaker module <b>1212</b> can then be inserted within any user's ear canal. To release sleeve <b>1310</b> from speaker module <b>1212</b>, a user or dispenser pries strap <b>1314</b> outwardly using a suitable tool (e.g., thumbnail) until it clears flange <b>1214</b>, and then withdraws speaker module <b>1212</b> from open end <b>1316</b> of sleeve <b>1310</b> (e.g., by applying moderate pulling force to tubular portion <b>1222</b> of link module <b>1220</b>). Those skilled in the art will recognize that other releasable latching schemes can be employed, which fall within the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">Advantageously, in embodiments of earpiece auditory device <b>1440</b>, link module <b>1220</b> in its entirety including speaker module <b>1212</b> is dispenser replaceable by the professional without needing to be returned to the factory. Optionally, universal tip assembly <b>1330</b>, which is inexpensive, can be separately dispenser or user replaceable.</p>
    <p num="p-0127"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A–15B</figref> depict a further embodiment of CIC/BTE earpiece auditory device <b>1440</b>, including link module <b>1520</b> incorporating custom ear mold <b>1510</b> fastened by a detachable locking pin. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15C–15F</figref> illustrate details of detachable locking pin assembly embodiment <b>1550</b> used in link module embodiment <b>1520</b>. Similar to link module <b>1220</b>, link module <b>1520</b> includes module fastener <b>100</b>, tubular portion <b>1522</b> similar to tubular portion <b>1222</b>, and integrally attached speaker module <b>1212</b>, which in the present embodiment is encapsulated together with hollow straight tube <b>1512</b> aligned along the axis of speaker <b>1540</b>. Speaker module <b>1212</b> can be encapsulated into a variety of sizes and shapes, but for commonality of manufacturing is depicted with the same size, shape, and material as described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A–12C</figref> and <b>14</b>A–<b>14</b>B.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">Custom ear mold <b>1510</b> is made of a soft polymer material, for example an elastomer or silicone in the 3–40 durometer range, and is individually shaped to fit exactly within the ear canal of a particular user. In the present embodiment, custom ear mold <b>1510</b> is encapsulated around collar <b>1513</b>, which contains a clearance hole dimensioned to slide over the outer diameter of hollow straight tube <b>1512</b>. Preferably custom ear mold <b>1510</b> is fabricated using a form of rapid prototyping technology, for example stereolithography (SLA). With this technology, the surface of user's ear canal or an ear mold cast from the user's ear is optically scanned, and the scan data is used to control a selective polymerization or material removal process to replicate exactly the shape of the original scanned surface. In some implementations, the scan data is digitized, electronically stored indefinitely, and/or manipulated or processed as desired. In some versions a direct replica, e.g., custom ear mold <b>1510</b> is produced from the scan data. In other versions a negative shell or mold of acrylic or other suitable material is produced directly, from which custom ear mold <b>1510</b> is produced indirectly by a casting process.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">To assemble CIC module <b>1530</b> of link module <b>1520</b>, custom ear mold <b>1510</b> containing collar <b>1513</b>, slides over hollow straight tube <b>1512</b> encapsulated into speaker module <b>1212</b>, until custom ear mold <b>1510</b> seats against speaker module <b>1212</b>. Hollow detachable locking pin <b>1514</b> containing flange <b>1515</b> is inserted through the open end of collar <b>1513</b> and is forced into hollow straight tube <b>1512</b>. Because the outside diameter of flange <b>1515</b> is larger than the inside diameter of hollow straight tube <b>1512</b>, detachable locking pin <b>1514</b> makes an interference fit with hollow straight tube <b>1512</b>, thereby deforming the outer wall of hollow straight tube <b>1512</b> and locking custom ear mold <b>1510</b> onto speaker module <b>1212</b> through frictional force. CIC module <b>1530</b> containing custom ear mold <b>1510</b> can then be inserted within the user's ear canal. To disassemble CIC module <b>1530</b>, detachable locking pin <b>1514</b> can be pried out of hollow straight tube <b>1512</b> using a suitable tool, for example a wedge, vise, or pliers. Detachable locking pin <b>1514</b>, collar <b>1513</b>, and hollow straight tube <b>1512</b> are preferably made of a resilient silicone or fluorocarbon (e.g., PTFE) type polymer material.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">Alternatively, detachable locking pin assembly <b>1550</b> can be used to secure a conventional universal soft umbrella tip, similar to umbrella tip <b>1320</b>, onto speaker module <b>1212</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0131"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A–16B</figref> depict an alternative earpiece auditory device, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, having a custom ear mold directly encapsulated onto link module <b>1620</b>. Similar to link module <b>1520</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A–15B</figref>, link module <b>1620</b> incorporates module fastener <b>100</b>, tubular portion <b>1522</b>, and speaker module <b>1212</b> encasing speaker <b>1540</b>. Custom ear mold <b>1610</b> similar to custom ear mold <b>1510</b> is directly encapsulated around speaker module <b>1212</b>. Orifice <b>1612</b> in the tip of custom ear mold <b>1610</b> provides a sound conducting passage to speaker <b>1540</b>. CIC module <b>1630</b> includes custom ear mold <b>1610</b> and speaker module <b>1212</b>. The materials and fabrication technology used in custom ear mold <b>1610</b> are substantially the same as those used in custom ear mold <b>1510</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">This nondetachable version is essentially a single-piece component that includes speaker module <b>1212</b> all the way to custom ear mold <b>1610</b>. Speaker <b>1540</b> is thus completely encapsulated into a custom molded component, and accordingly would be disposable, such that if speaker <b>1540</b> failed, rather than repairing that speaker, an entire exact duplicate assembly can be recreated using the electronically stored scan data file of that particular ear mold. Everything including entire link module <b>1620</b> and from there downward would be replaced.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">Detachability typically occurs between module fastener <b>100</b> at the proximal end of link module <b>1620</b> and BTE processing module <b>110</b>. In other words, the complete custom version auditory device appears as a two-piece unit to the user or dispenser: just the BTE processor <b>110</b> and link module <b>1620</b> including integral speaker module <b>1212</b> and custom ear mold <b>1610</b>, versus the three-piece configuration of universal version <b>1440</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">In some embodiments, the distal end of link module <b>1220</b> or <b>1620</b> could be detachable from the speaker module and ear mold. However, it may be more cost effective and efficient not to add the complexity and expense of the additional distal connector pins to couple wires that go through that link to the speaker, but simply to make link module <b>1220</b> or <b>1620</b> disposable including integral speaker module <b>1212</b> and custom ear mold <b>1610</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">In alternative embodiments, the proximal end of link module <b>1220</b> or <b>1620</b> could be nondetachably integrated with BTE processing module <b>110</b>, thereby eliminating detachable module fastener <b>100</b>, such that BTE/CIC earpiece auditory device <b>1440</b> can be manufactured as a single-piece disposable unit.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
