The needle guard includes a proximal arm or wall that includes an opening through which a needle passes for axial movement. When the needle is retracted from the catheter, it releases the force that had previously prevented movement of the needle guard within the catheter hub. This in turn causes the needle guard to snap into a position in which it is clamped onto the needle shaft and in which its distal wall blocks access to the needle tip. In this condition, the spring needle guard and needle can be removed from the catheter hub. A slot or crimp may be formed in the needle shaft that engages with the needle guard after the protected needle and needle guard are removed from the catheter hub.</div>

    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p>This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,278, filed Oct. 30, 1998, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,108, filed Jun. 12, 1998, now which is a continuation-in-part of Application Ser. No. 08/915,148, filed Aug. 20, 1997 abandoned, the entire contents of each of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates generally to intravenous (IV) catheters, and, in particular, to a safety IV catheter in which the needle tip is automatically covered after needle withdrawal to prevent the healthcare worker from making accidental contact with the needle tip.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>IV catheters are primarily used to administer fluids, sometimes containing medications, directly into a patient's vascular system. The catheter is inserted into a patient's vein by a healthcare worker by using a handheld placement device that includes a sharp tip needle. The needle is positioned in the interior hollow portion of the catheter with its tip extended slightly beyond the edge of the catheter. The end of the apparatus opposite the needle tip is made up of the needle connected to a needle hub which is capable of being held by the healthcare worker during the insertion procedure.</p>
    <p>The insertion procedure contains four basic steps: (1) the healthcare worker inserts the needle and catheter together into the patient's vein; (2) after insertion into the vein with the needle point, the catheter is forwarded into the vein of the patient by the healthcare worker pushing the catheter with his or her finger; (3) the healthcare worker withdraws the needle by grasping the hub end (opposite the point end) while at the same time applying pressure to the patient's skin at the insertion site with his or her free hand; and (4) the healthcare worker then tapes the now inserted catheter to the patient's skin and connects the exposed end of the catheter (the catheter hub) to the source of the fluid to be administered into the patient's vein.</p>
    <p>The problem is that, immediately after the withdrawal of the needle from the patient's vein, the healthcare worker, who is at this time involved in at least two urgent procedures, must place the exposed needle tip at a nearby location and address the tasks required to accomplish the needle withdrawal. It is at this juncture that the exposed needle tip creates a danger of an accidental needle stick occurring, which, under the circumstances, leaves the healthcare worker vulnerable to the transmission of various dangerous blood-borne pathogens, including AIDS and hepatitis.</p>
    <p>This danger to the healthcare worker from accidental needle sticks has caused an impetus for the development of a safer IV catheter in which the occurrence of such accidental needle sticks is prevented. Safety catheters that have been developed to achieve this result are disclosed, for example, in Lemieux Reissue U.S. Pat. No. Re. 34,416, Crawford U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,651, McLees U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,504, Gaba U.S. Pat. No. 5,697,907, and Dombrowski U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,344. Kulli U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,241 and Chamuel U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,107 disclose a protective needle guard for use with a hypodermic needle.</p>
    <p>The prior art safety catheters all exhibit one or more drawbacks that have thus far limited their usefulness and full acceptance by healthcare workers. For example, in the safety catheter disclosed in the Lemieux patent, the force required to engage the needle slot within the guard flange is relatively great and would interfere with the removal of the needle. Reducing this force to a more acceptable level would create the possibility of the needle guard remaining in the catheter hub after the needle is removed from the catheter. As a result, the safety catheter disclosed in the Lemieux patent would not consistently function in a reliable manner.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the user of the safety catheter disclosed in the Dombrowski patent would have to exert a considerable force to remove the protective cap from the catheter hub when the cap engages a needle. The safety catheter disclosed in the Dombrowski patent would also be relatively expensive to fabricate because of its inclusion of a flexible flange and a tether.</p>
    <p>The McLees protective device requires an irksome extra pulling action or tug on the needle guard through a retention ring to remove the protected needle from the catheter hub. The McLees device also requires the assembly of two separate components and is thus relatively costly to manufacture. In addition, the needle in the McLees device includes a larger diameter portion near and at the needle tip. This feature of the McLees device would require that the remainder of the needle be of a lesser diameter which would have the adverse effect of slowing the blood flashback through the needle.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a safety IV catheter which reliably and automatically prevents accidental, inadvertent contact with the needle tip after use.</p>
    <p>It is a further object of the invention to provide a safety catheter which provides reliable protection to the healthcare practitioner against needle sticks without requiring any change in the manner of use of the safety catheter by the practitioner.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a safety IV catheter of the type described which is relatively simple and inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
    <p>It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a safety catheter of the type described in which removal of the needle from the needle guard after use is prevented.</p>
    <p>To these ends, the safety IV catheter of the invention includes a resilient spring clip needle guard that includes a distal or front end and a proximal or rear wall. The spring clip is inserted into the catheter hub and is urged by the needle shaft into contact with the inner walls of the catheter hub so that the needle guard is reliably retained therein. When the needle is withdrawn from the catheter, the force it had previously exerted on the needle guard is released, causing the needle guard to pivot within the catheter hub until it clamps onto the needle shaft. At this time, the distal end wall of the needle guard blocks the distal pointed end tip of the needle. In addition, the spring clip and protected needle onto which it is clamped can be readily and safely removed from the catheter hub. The needle may be provided with a slot or, alternatively, may be provided with a segment of increased width, such as a crimp, which cooperates with the needle guard to prevent the inadvertent removal of the needle from the needle guard after their removal from the catheter hub.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, an IV catheter apparatus is provided which comprises a tubular catheter having a proximal end and a distal end and a needle having a needle shaft and a tip, where the needle is received within the tubular catheter when in a ready position. A catheter hub is attached to the proximal end of the catheter, where the catheter hub has a hollow interior and an inner wall. The needle is movable between the ready position, in which the tip is outside of the catheter hub, and a retracted position, in which the tip is within the interior of the catheter hub. A unitary needle guard is positioned in the interior of the catheter hub and includes a resilient portion engaged by the needle shaft when the needle is in its ready position. A section of the resilient portion of the needle guard is urged by the needle shaft into contact with an interior wall of the catheter hub when the needle is in its ready position. An inwardly extending annular protrusion is formed on the interior wall of the catheter hub for engaging a segment of the needle guard for retaining the needle guard in the catheter hub during the movement of the needle between its ready position and its retracted position. The needle guard includes a distal wall extending from the resilient portion and spaced from the needle tip when the needle is in its ready position and movable within the interior of the catheter hub to a blocking position distal of the needle tip when the needle is in its retracted position in which the needle shaft no longer exerts a force on the resilient portion of the needle guard, such that contact between the segment of the needle guard and the catheter hub is released.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the spring clip safety catheter of the invention, a retaining groove or bump is formed in the inner wall of the catheter hub, which, in the ready position, engages a lower arm of the spring clip to aid in the retention of the spring clip in the catheter hub.</p>
    <p>In yet a further embodiment of the spring clip safety catheter of the invention, a slot is formed in the needle. After the spring clip has pivoted to its retracted position and the needle is clamped by the spring clip, further movement of the needle in the proximal direction will cause the rear or proximal arm of the spring clip to seat in the slot, thereby to more securely clamp the needle shaft to the spring clip.</p>
    <p>In a further embodiment of the spring clip catheter guard of the invention, a tether is connected to the needle hub and the spring clip guard to prevent the spring clip guard from being pulled off the protected needle without requiring an excessive clamping force therebetween.</p>
    <p>In yet a further embodiment of the invention, the spring clip needle guard is in the form of resilient intersecting arms, each terminating at a distal guard wall. When the needle is in the ready position, it passes through the guard and urges the resilient arms away from each other and against the inner wall of the catheter hub. When the needle is retracted past the guard walls, the resilient arms spring to the safety position in which both of the guard walls are positioned distally from the needle tip, thereby to form a barrier that prevents inadvertent contact with the needle tip.</p>
    <p>To the accomplishment of the above, and to such further objects as may hereinabove appear, the present invention relates to a safety IV catheter as described with respect to presently preferred embodiments in the following specification, as considered with the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The safety IV catheter of the invention, generally designated <b>10</b> in the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 1B, includes a needle hub <b>12</b> that includes an axial opening <b>14</b> which securely receives the proximal end of a needle <b>16</b> having a sharpened tip <b>18</b>. The needle hub <b>12</b>, as is conventional, is hollow and includes a flash chamber <b>22</b>. As is also conventional, the needle <b>16</b> is received within a hollow tubular catheter <b>24</b>, the proximal end of which is concentrically affixed within the distal end of a catheter hub <b>26</b> having a distal section <b>28</b> and a contiguous, larger diameter proximal section <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>The catheter hub <b>26</b> terminates at its proximal end in a Luer fitting <b>32</b> adapted to receive a tubing set which, in a known manner, administers intravenous fluid into the patient. The catheter <b>24</b> is secured within an axial passageway <b>34</b> in the distal hub section <b>28</b> by means of a sleeve <b>20</b> received within the passageway <b>34</b>, which engages the proximal end of the catheter. Passageway <b>34</b> communicates at its proximal end with a flash chamber <b>36</b> formed in the hub section <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>In the ready position of the catheter, shown in FIG. 1A, the distal end of the needle hub <b>12</b> is snugly received in the proximal end of the interior of the chamber <b>36</b> such that the needle <b>16</b> extends through the chamber <b>36</b>, the passageway <b>34</b>, and distally beyond the catheter hub <b>26</b> and catheter <b>24</b>, so that its tip extends beyond the tapered distal end of the catheter.</p>
    <p>In use, the distal tip of the needle and the catheter are inserted into a patient's vein. Thereafter, the healthcare practitioner manually places the catheter further into the vein and then withdraws the needle by grasping and moving by hand the proximal end of the needle hub <b>12</b>. The Luer of the catheter hub <b>26</b> is then fitted with a source of the fluid that is to be administered into the patient's vein.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the present invention, as the needle <b>16</b> is being withdrawn from the patient, a protective needle guard <b>40</b> located within the hub chamber <b>36</b> automatically snaps into a retracted position in which it blocks access to the distal needle tip and prevents further distal movement of the needle tip, thereby to prevent accidental contact by the healthcare practitioner with the needle tip.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, the needle guard <b>40</b> is in the form of a unitary spring clip that is preferably made of a resilient metal such as stainless steel. The spring clip includes a distal arm <b>42</b> terminating at its upper end in a curved lip <b>44</b> and at its lower end in a pointed end <b>46</b> which, in the embodiment of FIG. 1, is received within a mating groove <b>48</b> formed in the lower interior wall of the catheter hub section <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>The spring clip needle guard <b>40</b> further includes a transverse segment <b>50</b> that extends upward and proximally from the lower pointed end <b>46</b> and terminates at a U-shaped upper end <b>52</b>. In the ready position of the spring clip shown in FIG. 1A, the upper end <b>52</b> abuts against the upper interior wall of the catheter hub section <b>30</b>. The spring clip guard <b>40</b> further includes a vertical arm <b>54</b> that extends downward from the U-shaped upper end <b>52</b> and terminates above the lower wall of the catheter hub section <b>30</b>. The transverse segment <b>50</b> and proximal vertical arm <b>54</b>, respectively, include axially aligned openings <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> through which the shaft of the needle <b>16</b> is free to pass and axially move. The diameter of the opening <b>58</b> is slightly greater than that of the needle shaft, whereas the diameter of the opening <b>56</b> is greater than that of the opening <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>In the ready position of the catheter prior to needle withdrawal, the shaft of the needle <b>16</b> engages the curved lip <b>44</b> of the spring clip needle guard <b>40</b>, thereby to exert an essentially downward force on the resilient spring clip. That force causes the lower end <b>46</b> of the spring clip to seat securely in the groove <b>48</b> at point A. That contact, in addition to the abutment of the upper end <b>52</b> of the spring clip with the upper interior wall at the catheter hub at point B, securely maintains the spring clip needle guard <b>40</b> in the ready position within the catheter hub.</p>
    <p>As the needle <b>16</b> is retracted to the left, as viewed in FIG. 1A, to its fully retracted position, shown in FIG. 1B, after catheter insertion into the patient's vein, the distal tip of the needle moves proximally past the curved lip <b>44</b> of the spring clip needle guard <b>40</b> at point C, at which time the downward force previously exerted by the needle shaft on the spring clip is released.</p>
    <p>As a result of the needle <b>16</b> moving proximally past point C, the retention force on the spring clip needle guard <b>40</b> in the catheter hub is released, causing the spring clip needle guard <b>40</b> to pivot or snap in a clockwise direction to the retracted position shown in FIG. <b>1</b>B. As therein shown, distal arm <b>42</b> of the needle guard <b>40</b> blocks the distal path of the needle <b>16</b>. Simultaneously with the blocking and releasing actions, the spring clip guard <b>40</b> becomes securely clamped onto the needle shaft at points D and E, thereby to securely lock the needle guard <b>40</b> onto the needle shaft. At this time, the needle <b>16</b> and needle guard <b>40</b> can be removed together from the catheter hub <b>26</b>, and the tip of the needle cannot be pushed past the needle guard because it is blocked by the distal arm <b>42</b> and lip <b>44</b> of the needle guard.</p>
    <p>If desired, a slot <b>60</b> may be formed in the needle shaft slightly proximal to the needle tip. When the needle and the needle guard are in their retracted and clamped positions (FIG. <b>1</b>B), slot <b>60</b> is positioned slightly distal to the clamping point E of the transverse segment of the needle guard <b>40</b> such that if a subsequent attempt is made to move the needle further in a rearward or proximal direction, the transverse segment <b>50</b> at point E will seat into slot <b>60</b>, thereby to provide an additional force to retain the needle guard <b>40</b> on the needle <b>16</b> in the protected position in which access to the needle tip is prevented.</p>
    <p>The safety IV catheter illustrated in FIGS. 1C and 1D is the same as that illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 1B, except that the slot <b>60</b> in the needle shaft in the latter is replaced in the former by a crimp <b>61</b> whose width is greater than that of the opening <b>58</b> in the vertical arm <b>54</b>. If an attempt is made to move the protected needle illustrated in FIG. 1C in the rearward or proximal direction, the crimp <b>61</b> will engage the wall <b>54</b> and will thus not be able to pass through the opening <b>58</b>, so as to prevent further proximal movement of the needle and removal of the needle from the needle guard, as defined.</p>
    <p>The embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 2 is similar to that of FIG. 1 except that, instead of the groove formed in the lower wall of the catheter hub that engages the lower end of the spring clip, a retaining bump <b>62</b> is formed in that wall against which the lower end <b>46</b> of the needle guard <b>42</b> seats when the needle guard <b>40</b> is in the ready position, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A.</p>
    <p>The embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B is essentially the same as that of FIG. 2 with the addition of a tether <b>64</b> secured at one end to the needle hub <b>12</b> and at its other end to the proximal arm <b>54</b> of the spring clip needle guard <b>40</b>. As shown in FIG. 3B, the tether <b>64</b> is extended to its full length when the needle hub is retracted to achieve needle removal, so as to more securely retain the needle hub <b>12</b> and the spring clip needle guard <b>40</b> when the latter is clamped onto the needle when in the retracted position in which, as described above, the distal arm <b>42</b> of the spring clip prevents access to the needle tip, and the needle guard <b>40</b> and needle are released from the catheter hub.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate a spring clip needle guard embodying the principles of the invention in an alternative configuration. As therein shown, the spring clip needle guard <b>40</b> <i>a </i>includes a distal arm <b>65</b> terminating at its upper end in a curved lip <b>66</b> and at its lower end in a U-shaped portion <b>67</b> which, in the ready position illustrated in FIG. 4A, contacts a bump <b>68</b> formed in the lower inner wall of the catheter hub.</p>
    <p>A transverse segment <b>69</b> having a central opening <b>70</b> extends proximally and upwardly and terminates at an upper U-shaped portion <b>72</b>. A proximal end wall <b>74</b> having an opening <b>76</b> depends vertically from portion <b>72</b> and then extends distally in a horizontal lower segment <b>78</b> which has an opening <b>80</b> through which the lower halves of the distal arm <b>65</b> and the transverse segment <b>69</b> extend in the ready position of the needle guard. Segment <b>78</b>, at its distal end, extends upwardly at a front wall <b>82</b> which has a central opening <b>84</b> axially aligned with openings <b>70</b>, <b>76</b>. At its upper end, the distal front wall <b>82</b> extends in the proximal direction in an upper segment <b>86</b> which, as shown in FIG. 4A, contacts the upper inner wall of the catheter hub along substantially its entire length.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 4A, when the catheter is in the ready position, the needle shaft passes through openings <b>70</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>84</b> and rests on the curved lip <b>66</b>, urging the arm <b>65</b> against the bump <b>68</b> in the lower wall of the catheter hub. That engagement, along with the resilient engagement of the upper segment <b>86</b> with the upper interior wall of the catheter hub, retains the spring clip <b>40</b> <i>a </i>in its ready position within the catheter hub.</p>
    <p>When the needle hub and needle are retracted to the right, as viewed in FIG. 4A, by a sufficient amount, the needle tip passes below the lip <b>66</b> and then releases its downward force on the arm <b>65</b>. As described above with reference to the first-described embodiment, this release of engagement of the needle shaft and the spring clip arm <b>65</b> causes the arm <b>65</b> to snap upwards to the retracted position illustrated in FIG. 4B, in which the arm <b>65</b> and the lip <b>66</b> extend over the needle tip and thereby prevent accidental contact with the needle tip as desired. In this condition, the needle guard is clamped onto the needle shaft in essentially the same manner described above with respect to the first-described embodiment, and the needle and needle guard clamped thereto can be readily removed from the catheter hub, also as described above and as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>B.</p>
    <p>The embodiment of the needle guard illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B is essentially the same as that shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, with the addition of a slot <b>90</b> near the distal tip end of the needle. When the needle and needle guard are in their retracted and clamped position (FIG. <b>5</b>B), the slot <b>90</b> is positioned slightly distal to the clamping point of the transverse segment <b>69</b> such that if a subsequent attempt is made to move the needle further in a rearward or proximal direction, the transverse segment <b>69</b> will seat into the slot <b>90</b>, thereby to provide an additional force to retain the needle guard in the needle in the protected position in which access to the needle tip is prevented.</p>
    <p>The embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B is the same as that illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B, except for the inclusion of a tether <b>92</b> secured at one end to the needle hub and at its other end to the proximal wall of the spring clip needle guard. As shown in FIG. 6A, in the ready position, the tether is wound around the distal end of the needle hub. As shown in FIG. 6B, when the needle and needle guard are in their retracted position, the tether is extended to its full length and aids in the retention of the needle guard to the needle hub. If desired, the embodiment of the invention embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B could also include a needle slot as in the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B.</p>
    <p>The embodiment of FIGS. 7A-7C differs from the previously described embodiments primarily with regard to the construction and operation of the spring clip needle guard <b>96</b>. As shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, the spring clip <b>96</b> includes a central transverse section <b>98</b> which includes a central slot <b>100</b>. A sloping section <b>102</b> extends from section <b>98</b> in the proximal direction and terminates at a curved end <b>104</b> from which a proximal vertical arm <b>106</b> extends. The arm <b>106</b> terminates at its lower end in a U-shaped section <b>108</b>. The distal end of the transverse section <b>98</b> terminates in a curved section <b>110</b> from which a vertical proximal arm <b>112</b> extends. The distal arm <b>112</b> terminates at its upper end in a curved arm <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>A cutout portion in section <b>98</b> defines a flexible flap <b>116</b> which terminates at its distal free end in a downwardly sloping locking tab <b>18</b>. As in the prior embodiments, the proximal arm <b>106</b> includes an opening <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 7A, the spring clip needle guard <b>96</b>, when in the ready position illustrated therein, is inserted within the catheter hub <b>26</b> so as to allow the needle <b>16</b> to pass through the opening <b>58</b> and slot <b>100</b>. As in the previously described embodiments, the curved end <b>104</b> abuts against the inner upper wall of the catheter hub <b>26</b> at point B, and the curved section <b>110</b> seats within the mating groove <b>48</b> at point A formed in the lower inner wall of the catheter hub. In addition, the lower curved section <b>108</b> contacts at point F the lower inner wall of the catheter hub <b>26</b> at a location proximal to point B.</p>
    <p>In operation, the needle is initially withdrawn into the catheter hub until it reaches the tab engaged position illustrated in FIG. 7B in which, as therein shown, the locking tab <b>118</b> is received within the needle groove or slot <b>60</b>. At this point, the spring clip remains in contact with the inner wall of the catheter hub at points A, B and F, while the needle tip <b>18</b> engages the curved end <b>114</b>, thereby to urge section <b>110</b> into the groove <b>48</b> at point C. The relative position of point F with respect to point B prevents the needle and clip from being prematurely released from the catheter hub by preventing the distal end of the clip from tipping upwards and the proximal end from slipping downward with the clip in the tab engaged position shown in FIG. <b>7</b>B.</p>
    <p>As the needle is withdrawn further away from the patient, as shown in FIG. 7C, the needle tip passes beyond the curved end <b>114</b>, thereby releasing the downward force that had been previously exerted on the curved end <b>114</b> by the needle.</p>
    <p>This sudden release of the downward force on the spring clip end causes the distal end of the spring clip <b>96</b> to pivot upward so that the distal end <b>112</b> of the spring clip <b>96</b> moves rapidly to a position in which it prevents or blocks the motion of the needle in the distal direction. The spring clip <b>96</b> is retained on the needle <b>16</b> and will be removed from the catheter hub <b>26</b> when the needle is completely removed. Movement of the spring clip <b>96</b> from its protecting or retracted position shown in FIG. 7C is further prevented by the insertion of the locking tab <b>118</b> into the needle groove <b>60</b>, which prevents the spring clip from rotating around the periphery of the needle. This, in turn, secures the spring clip on the needle, even if the clip were subjected to a twisting and pulling force.</p>
    <p>The safety IV catheter illustrated in FIGS. 7D and 7E is the same s that illustrated in FIGS. 7A and 7B, except that the slot <b>60</b> in the needle shaft in the latter is replaced in the former by a crimp <b>61</b> whose width is greater than that of the opening <b>58</b> in the vertical arm <b>54</b>. If an attempt is made to move the protected needle illustrated in FIG. 7D in the rearward or proximal direction, the crimp <b>61</b> will engage the wall <b>54</b> and will not be able to pass through the opening <b>58</b>, so as to prevent any further proximal movement of the needle and removal of the needle from the needle, as desired.</p>
    <p>The embodiment of the spring clip needle guard <b>120</b> disclosed in FIGS. 10A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>11</b> comprises first and second arms <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>, respectively, joined at their proximal ends in a hinged arrangement at <b>125</b> to the ends of a rear wall <b>126</b>. The distal ends of the arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> each include a curved protrusion <b>128</b> extending to a distal end wall <b>130</b>, which, in turn, terminates in a lip <b>132</b>. As seen best in FIG. 11, the rear wall <b>126</b> includes a central opening <b>134</b>, and the arms <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> each include a narrow portion <b>142</b> that extends between a distal wide portion <b>140</b> and a proximal wide portion <b>144</b>. A lateral clamping edge <b>146</b> is defined at the distal wide portion <b>144</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 10A, when the needle guard <b>120</b> is in its ready position, the curved protrusions <b>128</b> in each of the arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> are received in an annular groove or ring <b>136</b> formed in the inner wall of the catheter hub <b>26</b> which, as in the prior embodiments, is removably fit into the distal end of a needle hub <b>12</b>. Also as in the prior embodiment, a needle <b>16</b> having a sharpened tip <b>18</b> at its distal end is received within a tubular catheter <b>24</b> which is secured t the distal end of the catheter hub <b>26</b>. The proximal end of the needle <b>16</b> passes through the opening <b>134</b> in the rear wall <b>126</b>. The needle <b>16</b> includes an crimp <b>138</b> which is sufficiently small to allow the needle <b>16</b> to move axially along the catheter <b>24</b> but is greater in width than the opening <b>134</b> for reasons to be described below.</p>
    <p>In the ready position illustrated in FIG. 10A, the needle shaft passes through the needle guard and applies an outward radial force on the resilient arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> by means of its engagement with the lips <b>132</b>, so as to urge the curved protrusions <b>128</b> of each of the arms into the annular groove <b>136</b>, so as to retain the needle guard <b>120</b> in a fixed position within the inner wall of the catheter hub <b>26</b>. The shaft of a needle <b>16</b> that passes through the needle guard <b>120</b> frictionally engages the inner edges of the narrow portion <b>142</b> of arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> so as to further retain the needle in its ready position.</p>
    <p>When the needle is retracted axially to the right, as viewed in FIG. 10A, within the catheter hub and moves past the end lip <b>132</b> of the needle guard, the radial force previously exerted on the arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b> is suddenly released. This causes the distal end walls <b>130</b> of the needle guard to be released from their seat in the annular groove <b>136</b> and to pivot inward into the catheter hub until, as seen in FIG. 10B, the end walls <b>130</b> overlap one another at a location distally in front of the needle tip, thereby to form a barrier that prevents inadvertent contact with, and distal movement of, the needle tip. At the same time, the clamping edges <b>146</b> of the needle guard are urged against the needle tip to restrict further axial movement of the needle.</p>
    <p>As also shown in FIG. 10B, the needle guard <b>120</b> and the needle clamped to the needle guard after needle retraction can be removed from the catheter hub as a unitary assembly and safely discarded. If an attempt is made, intentionally or inadvertently, to pull the needle further to the right, as shown in FIG. 10B, out of the needle guard, the crimp <b>138</b> on the needle shaft will come into contact with the end wall <b>126</b>, and, since its width is greater than that of the opening <b>134</b>, the end wall <b>126</b> will at this point prevent any further axial movement of the needle out of the needle guard.</p>
    <p>This spring clip guard of the invention, in the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 12, <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B, includes a transverse arm <b>150</b> terminating at its distal end at a distal end wall <b>152</b>, which includes at its upper end a curved lip <b>154</b> and at its lower end a curved end <b>156</b>. An elongated rectangular opening or slot <b>158</b> is provided in the transverse arm <b>150</b>. The proximal ends of the transfer arm <b>150</b> and the opening <b>158</b> terminate at an extension <b>160</b> extending upwardly at an angle from the arm <b>150</b> and having a finger or flap <b>162</b> that extends toward the opening <b>158</b>.</p>
    <p>The proximal end of the extension <b>160</b> terminates t a curved end <b>166</b> from which a proximal end wall <b>168</b> extends downwardly. The wall <b>168</b>, which includes an opening <b>170</b>, terminates at its lower end at a curved section <b>172</b> from which extends an upwardly sloping arm <b>174</b> that terminates at a clamping edge <b>176</b>. As can be seen in FIGS. 13A and 13B, a 360° circular groove <b>178</b> is formed about the circumferential wall of the needle <b>16</b> slightly inwardly from the tip <b>18</b> of the needle.</p>
    <p>In the ready position of the spring clip guard of FIG. 12, as illustrated in FIG. 13A, the shaft of the needle passes through the aligned opening <b>170</b> in the rear wall <b>168</b> and the opening <b>158</b> in the transverse arm <b>150</b> and extends distally beyond the catheter hub. As in the prior embodiments described hereinabove, the needle shaft in this position exerts a downward radial force on the arm <b>150</b> by means of its engagement with the curved lip <b>154</b>. This downward force urges the curved end <b>156</b> of the spring clip to seat firmly within a groove <b>164</b> formed in the inner wall of the catheter hub at point A.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the upper curved end <b>166</b> of the end wall <b>168</b> engages the inner wall of the catheter hub at point B, and the lower curved end <b>172</b> of the wall <b>168</b> engages the inner wall of the catheter hub at point F. Further engagement between the needle shaft and the spring clip is provided by the contact of the finger <b>162</b> with the upper end of the needle shaft at point E and between the clamping edge <b>176</b> and the lower surface of the needle shaft at point G. In this manner, the needle is securely but movably retained within the catheter hub in its ready position.</p>
    <p>When the needle is retracted axially to the right, as viewed in FIGS. 13A and 13B, it eventually moves past its engagement with the lip <b>154</b>, thereby to suddenly release the radial force it had previously exerted on the arm <b>150</b> of the needle guard. This release of engagement between the needle shaft and the lip <b>154</b> allows the distal curved end <b>156</b> of the distal end wall <b>152</b> of the spring clip to be released from its seat in the annular groove <b>164</b> so that the arm <b>150</b> and the end wall <b>152</b> pivot quickly into the interior of the catheter hub, as seen in FIG. 13B, to a position at which the wall <b>152</b> forms a barrier to the needle tip. This positioning of the wall <b>15</b> prevents inadvertent contact with the needle tip. The engagement of the finger <b>162</b> and the clamping edge <b>176</b> to the opposing sides of the needle prevents further axial movement of the needle in either direction.</p>
    <p>If an attempt is thereafter made to pull the needle axially further to the right, as viewed in FIG. 13B, the finger <b>162</b> will enter the circular groove <b>178</b> formed in the needle surface, thereby to prevent further axial movement of the needle in the proximal direction out of the needle guard.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 14, yet a further embodiment of the present invention is generally similar to the embodiment shown in FIG. 10A, with the notable exception that the annular groove or ring <b>136</b> of the embodiment shown in FIG. 10A has been replaced with an inwardly extending annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>which serves an analogous function with respect to the annular groove or ring <b>136</b>. Preferably, the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>extends completely around the interior of the catheter hub <b>26</b> in a generally continuous ring-like fashion.</p>
    <p>The annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>removably retains the needle guard <b>120</b> within the catheter hub <b>26</b> as the needle <b>16</b> is withdrawn from the catheter hub <b>26</b>, until the arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b> move inwardly as the tip <b>18</b> of the needle <b>16</b> moves past the end lips <b>132</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b>, as discussed in detail above.</p>
    <p>Although the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>is shown in FIG. 14 as having a generally semi-circular cross-section, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various other cross-sectional configurations of the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>are likewise suitable. For example, the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>may alternatively have a generally triangular, square, rectangular, or any other desired cross-sectional configuration.</p>
    <p>The annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>is preferably formed integrally with respect to the catheter hub <b>26</b>, such as being injection molded as a portion thereof. Alternatively, the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>may be formed separately from the catheter hub <b>26</b> and attached to the catheter hub <b>26</b> via adhesive bonding, ultrasonic welding or any other desired method.</p>
    <p>Moreover, it will be appreciated that the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>may have any desired configuration which releasably retains the needle guard <b>120</b> within the catheter hub <b>26</b> until the tip <b>18</b> of the needle <b>16</b> has been withdrawn past the lips <b>132</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, when the needle guard <b>120</b> is in its ready position, the curved protrusions <b>128</b> in each of the arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> are positioned near, e.g., in abutting contact with, the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>formed on the inner wall of the catheter hub <b>26</b> which, as in the prior embodiments, is removably fit onto the distal end of a needle hub <b>12</b>. Also, as in the prior embodiment, a needle <b>16</b> having a sharpened tip <b>18</b> at its distal end is received within a tubular catheter <b>24</b> which is secured to the distal end of the catheter hub <b>26</b>. The proximal end of the needle <b>16</b> passes through the opening <b>134</b> in the rear wall <b>126</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b>. The needle <b>16</b> includes an crimp <b>138</b> which is sufficiently small to allow the needle <b>16</b> to move axially along the catheter <b>24</b> but which is greater in width than the opening <b>134</b> for reasons to be described below.</p>
    <p>In the ready position illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15, the needle shaft passes through the needle guard <b>120</b> and applies an outward radial force on the resilient arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> by means of its engagement with the lips <b>132</b>, so as to urge the curved protrusions <b>128</b> of each of the arms against the inner wall of the catheter hub <b>26</b>, so as to retain the needle guard <b>120</b> in a fixed position within the catheter hub <b>26</b>. As was the case with the embodiment described with respect to FIGS. 10A and 10B, the shaft of a needle <b>16</b> that passes through the needle guard <b>120</b> and optionally frictionally engages the inner edges of the narrow portion <b>142</b> (shown in FIG. 11) of arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> so as to further retain the needle in its ready position.</p>
    <p>When the needle is retracted axially to the right, as viewed in FIG. 14, and moves past the end lips <b>132</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b>, the radial force previously exerted on the needle guard arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> is suddenly released. The annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a </i>prohibits movement of the needle guard <b>120</b> to the right as the needle <b>16</b> moves to the right, until the tip <b>18</b> past the end lips <b>132</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b>. Movement of the tip <b>18</b> past the end lips <b>132</b> allows the resilient arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> and their protrusions <b>128</b> therein to move inwardly a sufficient distance to cease abutting the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>a</i>. As was the case with the embodiment described with regard to FIGS. 10A and 10B, the distal end walls pivot inward into the catheter hub until the end walls overlap one another at a location distally in front of the needle tip, thereby to form a barrier that prevents inadvertent contact with, and distal movement of, the sharpened needle tip <b>18</b>. At the same time, the clamping edges <b>146</b> of the needle guard (as described with respect to FIG. 11) are optionally urged against the needle <b>16</b> to restrict further axial movement of the needle, in relation to the needle guard <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>As again shown in FIG. 10B (which shows the needle <b>16</b> and the needle guard <b>120</b> removed from the catheter hub <b>26</b> and is thus applicable to both the embodiment of FIG. <b>10</b>A and the embodiment of FIG. <b>14</b>), the needle guard <b>120</b> is fixedly attached to the needle <b>16</b> after needle retraction, such that the needle guard and the needle can be removed from the catheter hub as a unitary assembly and safely discarded. If an attempt is made, either intentionally or inadvertently, to pull the needle further to the right (as viewed in FIG. 10B) out of the needle guard, the crimp <b>138</b> on the needle shaft will come into contact with the end wall <b>126</b>, and, since the crimp width is greater than the diameter of the opening <b>134</b>, the end wall <b>126</b> will, at this point, prevent any further axial movement of the needle out of the needle guard.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 16, the inwardly extending, generally annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>b </i>may alternatively be formed to have a generally C-shaped configuration. Optionally, the C-shaped protrusion <b>136</b> <i>b </i>may be defined by a metal snap ring which is partially disposed within a groove, such as groove <b>136</b> of FIG. 10<i>a</i>. Thus, the inwardly extending, generally annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>b </i>may be formed by sliding a metal snap ring into the catheter hub <b>26</b> until the metal snap ring snaps into a groove formed within the catheter hub <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 17, as a further alternative the inwardly extending, generally annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>c </i>may be defined so as to have two generally semi-circular segments or portions.</p>
    <p>Indeed, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various different configurations of the inwardly extending, generally annular protrusion are likewise suitable.</p>
    <p>Thus, the inwardly extending, generally annular protrusion may have any desired configuration. It is preferred that the inwardly extending, generally annular protrusion not have any gap(s) <b>137</b> (as shown in FIGS. 16 and 17) which have a width greater than the width of the distal end walls <b>130</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b>. Sizing the gaps <b>137</b> so as to be smaller than the width of the end walls tends to prevent the needle guard <b>120</b> from passing through such gaps <b>137</b> and thereby undesirably allowing the needle guard <b>120</b> to slip out of the needle hub <b>26</b> without properly protecting the tip <b>18</b> of the needle <b>16</b>. Thus, according to the present invention, any desired number of separate sections may be utilized to define the inwardly extending, generally annular protrusion, as long as the needle guard <b>120</b> is effectively held in place thereby as the needle <b>14</b> is withdrawn from the catheter <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, the crimp <b>138</b> formed in the needle <b>16</b> preferably defines a pair of generally opposed, outwardly extending bulges <b>138</b> <i>a </i>in the needle and also defines a pair of generally opposed, inwardly extending depressions <b>138</b> <i>b</i>, which are disposed generally orthogonally with respect to the bulges <b>138</b> <i>a</i>. The bulges <b>138</b> <i>a </i>define a crimp <b>138</b> having a width, dimension W, which is small enough to facilitate movement of the needle <b>16</b> within the catheter <b>24</b>, as shown in FIG. 14, and which is too large to pass through the central opening <b>134</b> formed in the end wall <b>126</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b>, as discussed above.</p>
    <p>The crimp <b>138</b> may be formed by any contemporary crimping process, such as those processes wherein two jaws of a vise or crimper come together so as to squeeze the needle <b>16</b> in a manner which forms the depressions <b>138</b> <i>b </i>of FIG. 19, thereby consequently also forming the bulges <b>138</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>The IV catheter shown in FIG. 14 is assembled by sliding the needle guard <b>120</b> over the sharpened tip <b>18</b> of the needle <b>16</b> before the crimp <b>138</b> is formed in the needle <b>16</b>. The needle <b>16</b> passes through the opening <b>134</b> formed in the end wall <b>126</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b>. The distal arms <b>132</b> are opened and the needle <b>16</b> passes through them. Next, the crimp <b>138</b> is formed in the needle <b>16</b>, so that the needle guard <b>120</b> is captured between the crimp <b>138</b> and the needle hub <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>Next, the needle <b>16</b>, having the needle guard <b>120</b> thereon, is slid into the catheter hub <b>26</b> such that the sharpened tip <b>18</b> of the needle <b>16</b> enters the catheter <b>24</b>. The needle <b>16</b> is slid into the catheter <b>24</b> until the curved protrusions <b>128</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b> abut the annular protrusion <b>136</b>A.</p>
    <p>Once the curved protrusions <b>128</b> abut the annular protrusion <b>136</b>A, the needle guard <b>120</b> ceases to move along with the needle <b>16</b>. The needle guard <b>120</b> may cease to move along with the needle <b>16</b> before the curved protrusions <b>128</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b> abut the annular protrusion <b>136</b>A, since the inner surface of the catheter hub <b>26</b> tapers inwardly, such that the inside diameter thereof is reduced as the needle guard <b>120</b> travels further into the catheter hub <b>26</b>. Thus, the needle guard <b>120</b> may cease moving along with the needle <b>16</b> due to such narrowing of the inside of the needle guard <b>26</b>, when the inside diameter of the catheter hub <b>26</b> becomes too small for the needle guard <b>120</b> to pass further therethrough.</p>
    <p>Once the needle guard <b>120</b> has ceased to move along with the needle <b>16</b> as the needle is inserted into the catheter <b>24</b>, a tool is used to gently urge the needle guard <b>120</b> further into the catheter hub <b>26</b>, until the curved protrusions <b>128</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b> pass beyond the annular protrusion <b>136</b>A. Sufficient force must be applied to the needle guard <b>120</b> via the tool so as to cause the curved protrusions of the needle guard <b>120</b> to flex toward one another such that they pass beyond the annular protrusion <b>136</b>A.</p>
    <p>After the curved protrusions <b>128</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b> have passed beyond the annular protrusion <b>136</b>A and have flexed back outwardly, generally so as to contact the inner wall of the catheter hub <b>26</b>, then the needle guard <b>120</b> is in the ready position as shown in FIG. <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>The tool used to urge the needle guard <b>120</b> past the annular protrusion <b>136</b> within the catheter hub <b>26</b> may comprise any convenient structure suitable for such use. For example, as shown in FIG. 20, a simple pin <b>200</b> with a slot <b>202</b> running the length thereof (so as to receive the needle <b>16</b> as the needle guard <b>120</b> is pushed) may suffice.</p>
    <p>Thus, when the IV catheter of the present invention is assembled, the curved protrusions <b>128</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b> positively engage the inwardly extending annular protrusion <b>136</b>A such that the needle guard <b>120</b> remains within the catheter hub <b>26</b> as the needle <b>16</b> is withdrawn from the catheter <b>24</b>, until the sharpened tip <b>18</b> of the needle passes between the lips <b>132</b> of the needle guard <b>120</b> so as to disengage the curved protrusions <b>128</b> with respect to the annular protrusion <b>136</b>A to allow the needle guard <b>120</b> to move out of the catheter hub <b>26</b> along with the needle <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>An alternative method for assembling the spring clip safety I.V. catheter of the present invention may be utilized when the annular protrusion is configured as a C-shaped protrusion or an open ring <b>136</b> <i>b</i>, as shown in FIG. <b>16</b> and is formed separately from the catheter hub <b>26</b>. In this instance, the open ring <b>136</b> <i>b </i>can be placed upon the needle guard <b>120</b> (between the proximal and distal ends thereof) after the needle <b>16</b> has been passed through the needle guard <b>120</b> and crimped. Then, both the needle guard <b>120</b> and the open ring <b>136</b> <i>b </i>may be simultaneously pushed into the catheter hub <b>26</b> utilizing the same tool.</p>
    <p>This tool preferably has at least two fingers, one of which which extends along each side of the needle guard <b>120</b>, so as to push the open ring <b>136</b> <i>b </i>further into the catheter hub <b>26</b> than the proximal end of the needle guard <b>120</b>. In this manner, the needle guard <b>120</b> does not have to be pushed over the annular protrusion <b>136</b>. Rather, the needle guard <b>120</b> and the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>b </i>are assembled together, i.e., along with one another. The annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>b </i>is thus assembled into the catheter hub <b>26</b> so as to lock the needle guard <b>120</b> into position, where the needle guard <b>120</b> remains until the needle <b>16</b> is moved to the protective position thereof, as discussed in detail above.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 21 and 22, yet a further alternative method for assembling the needle guard <b>120</b> <i>a </i>into the catheter hub <b>26</b> is shown. According to this alternative method, the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>d </i>is configured so as to have at least four openings <b>137</b> formed therein and is configured so that the needle guard <b>120</b> <i>a </i>may pass through the openings <b>137</b> utilizing very little or no insertion force. After the needle guard <b>120</b> <i>a </i>has been pushed into the catheter hub <b>26</b> past the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>d</i>, then the needle guard <b>120</b> <i>a </i>is rotated so as to position the four corners <b>250</b> thereof behind the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>d </i>as shown in FIG. 22, which then functions so as to maintain the needle guard <b>120</b> <i>a </i>with the catheter hub <b>26</b> until the needle <b>16</b> is withdrawn and moved into the protective position thereof, as discussed in detail above.</p>
    <p>It may be desirable to form the needle guard <b>120</b> <i>a </i>so as to provide a generally square profile, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 22. However, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, various different generally square, rectangular or other profiles of the needle guard <b>120</b> <i>a </i>are likewise suitable. It is merely necessary to locate the openings <b>137</b> formed in the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>d </i>such that the needle guard <b>120</b> <i>a </i>is readily received therebetween during the assemble process and is then held in place thereby, after rotating the needle guard <b>120</b> <i>a </i>so as to place the corners <b>250</b> thereof into abutting contact with the annular protrusion <b>136</b> <i>d. </i> </p>
    <p>It will thus be appreciated that the spring clip needle guard of the invention as employed in an IV catheter provides automatic and reliable protection of the needle tip upon needle retraction to prevent accidental contact with the needle tip by a healthcare practitioner. It will also be appreciated that modifications may be made to the embodiments of the invention specifically described hereinabove without necessarily departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
