The link program will display the portion of the raster image which fits within a predetermined CAD window and will scale the raster image up or down as necessary to fit within the display window. The raster image is displayed on a computer screen and provides a useful reference for an operator to create a CAD image which is a duplicate of the raster image by tracing directly over the raster image or, alternatively, to implement desired changes in the raster image using CAD commands. An edit program merges the CAD image and the original raster image to create a new, updated raster image, which includes all CAD-generated changes made by the operator. The updated raster image can be reproduced in hard copy form by a raster plotter.</div>

<p num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/782,876 filed Oct. 17, 1991, now abandoned, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 07/366,665 filed Jun. 14, 1989, now abandoned.</p>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention relates to computer aided design systems and in particular to an apparatus and method for manipulating scanned documents in an existing computer aided design system.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Computer aided design (CAD) packages are commonly used to create and edit drawings and other graphic displays on a computer screen or other cathode ray tube (CRT) display. CAD systems are particularly well-suited for producing engineering design drawings by allowing the user to enter a series of commands to produce certain standard elements of the drawing, such as circles, squares and lines, at selected locations on screen to effect a particular design. A locator device such as a pointer, cursor, “mouse” or cross-hair, is used to select the position on the screen at which a particular element is to be drawn. Changes to the drawing can be made directly on screen. The display scale can be changed to zoom in on selected portions of the drawing.</p>
  <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading> <p num="p-0005">According to prior practice, drawings may be created “from scratch” using the CAD system or, alternatively, a hard copy drawing may be reproduced on screen by entering the proper sequence of drawing commands into the CAD system. Reproduction of a hard copy drawing on screen using the CAD system is a tedious, time consuming process, which requires the operator to match up the various features of the hard copy drawing with their respective locations on screen and to enter the proper commands into the CAD system to create the image.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">It is also known in the art to scan a hard copy document to produce a raster image, which is stored in the system memory as a plurality of data bits corresponding to the number of picture elements (pixels) comprising the raster image. The raster image is then converted into a vector-based image which is compatible with the CAD system. The vector-based image can be displayed on screen, changed and otherwise manipulated using CAD commands.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">One problem associated with the aforementioned technique of converting the raster image to a vector-based image is that the lengths of the pixels in the raster image are changed to equivalent horizontal vectors. As a result, resolution problems may occur, especially when the image is zoomed in to display small portions thereof, because the vector-image degrades into short horizontal or vertical lines on the screen.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Another technique involves converting groups of pixels into CAD commands corresponding to selected features of the drawings, such as circles, squares and lines, using artificial intelligence. One problem associated with this technique is that recognition errors often occur, which necessitate manual “clean-up” of the drawing by a skilled operator.</p>
  <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0009">It is, therefore, the principal object of the present invention to provide an improved apparatus and method for manipulating scanned documents using computer aided design commands.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">It is another object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method for facilitating the reproduction of hard copy documents with a computer aided design system.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">It is still another object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method for facilitating the editing of documents on a computer screen using standard computer aided design commands.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">It is yet another object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method for producing a raster image output from a standard computer aided design system.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0013">These and other objects are accomplished in accordance with the present invention wherein apparatus and method for manipulating a scanned document in an electronic data processing system includes means for electronically displaying a first image representing the scanned document and for displaying a second image in response to user input commands superimposed on the first image. In one aspect of the invention the scanned document is represented by a first digital coded image, which includes a first plurality of image elements, each of which has a defined position relative to a predetermined reference position or predetermined origin. A second digital coded image representing the user input commands is also generated, which includes a second plurality of image elements, each of which has a defined position relative to the predetermined reference position. The first digital coded image is electronically displayed as the first image and the second digital coded image is electronically displayed as the second image superimposed on the first image. The first image is maintained substantially in registration with the second image.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In another embodiment means responsive to a command indicating that only a selected portion of the scanned document is to be displayed is provided for manipulating the first image to display only the selected portion of the scanned document. In yet another embodiment, the means for displaying only the selected portion of the first image includes means for determining the location and boundaries of a substantially rectangular window representing the selected portion of the scanned document which is to be displayed as the first image; means for identifying the particular ones of the first plurality of image elements which fall within the boundaries of the display window; and means for adjusting the scale of the first image to conform to the display window.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In the preferred embodiment the first image is a raster image and the first plurality of image elements are a corresponding plurality of picture elements, each of which is in either an on or an off state. Each element which is in an on state has a first color associated therewith and each element which is in an off state has a second color associated therewith, which is different from the first color. The second image is a vector image comprised of a plurality of vectors, certain ones of which have defined starting and ending positions with respect to the predetermined reference position and others of which represent corresponding predetermined shapes at respective positions with respect to the predetermined reference position. Each vector typically has a predetermined color associated therewith.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">In another aspect of the invention, the second image represents changes which the user desires to implement in the first image and means are provided for editing the first image to incorporate the second image. In one embodiment the first image is displayed in first and second colors, the second color being different from the first color. The second image is displayed in at least one color. The first image is edited so that a first portion thereof which is displayed in the first color and is overlaid by a corresponding first portion of the second image, which is displayed in the second color, is erased and a second portion of the second image, which overlays a corresponding second portion of the first image and is displayed in a color other than the second color, is incorporated into the first image to change the second portion of the first image. A third portion of the first image which is not overlaid by any portion of the second image remains unchanged.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">In the preferred embodiment, the first image is a raster image, which includes a plurality of picture elements, each of which is either in an on or an off state. Each element which is in an on state is displayed in the first color and each element which is in an off state is displayed in the second color. Each of the picture elements has a defined position with respect to a predetermined reference position. The second image is a vector image, which includes a plurality of vectors, each of which is displayed in a predetermined color. The editing means includes means for identifying a first set of picture elements comprising the first portion of the first image and for changing said first set of picture elements from an on state to an off state and for identifying a second set of picture elements comprising the second portion of the first image and changing the second set of picture elements from an off state to an on state. The first color preferably represents the foreground color of the raster image and the second color represents the background color of the raster image.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p num="p-0025">In the description which follows like parts are marked throughout the specification and drawings, respectively. The drawings are not necessarily to scale and in some instances proportions have been exaggerated in order to more clearly depict certain features of the invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional computer aided design (CAD) system <b>10</b> receives user inputs via an input/output (I/O) device <b>12</b> (which may include a key board) and translates the inputs into selected commands to control a software-implemented display driver <b>14</b>, which in turn controls a hardware display device <b>16</b>. The CAD commands are used to produce a design drawing or the like on a computer screen display. The user manipulates a locator device, such as a pointer, cursor, or “mouse”, to select the location on the screen at which a particular drawing feature is to be displayed.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">For example, the user can control CAD system <b>10</b> to produce a circle, square, line or other standard drawing feature, at a particular position on the display by positioning the locator device at the selected position on the display and entering the appropriate command. CAD system <b>10</b> will respond to the user input by controlling display driver <b>14</b> and display device <b>16</b> to produce the selected drawing feature at the selected location on the screen display. The user inputs corresponding to the desired drawing features are stored in a vector database <b>18</b> where the design features are represented by a plurality of discrete vectors, selected ones of which have starting and ending point coordinates with reference to a predetermined origin or vector origin.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">Other ones of the vectors may represent a predetermined geometric shape, such as a circle, at a predetermined position relative to a defined reference position. Using CAD system <b>10</b>, a user can construct detailed design drawings and edit the drawings as necessary directly on screen. The drawing is stored in digital code form in vector database <b>18</b> and can be printed out in hard copy form on an output device, such as a plotter. The display color, origin point and scale can be selected by the user.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in accordance with the present invention, a link program is interposed between CAD system <b>10</b> and display driver <b>14</b> to intercept CAD commands and interpret such commands to manipulate a scanned document in response thereto. The scanned document is stored in memory in digital code form, which represents a raster image of the document. The link program includes a resident link program <b>20</b>, which interprets the CAD commands, and a transient link program <b>22</b>, which retrieves the raster image from a raster database <b>24</b>. The raster image is entered into raster database <b>24</b> by optically scanning a hard copy raster image <b>26</b> using a conventional scanning device <b>28</b>, such as an optical image reader.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">Resident link program <b>20</b> serves as a terminate and stay resident (TSR) program to monitor the CAD commands flowing between CAD system <b>10</b> and display driver <b>14</b>. Upon intercepting a “CLEAR SCREEN” or similar command, resident link program <b>20</b> loads transient link program <b>22</b>, which performs the actual manipulation of the displayed raster image in accordance with the CAD commands. Transient link program <b>22</b> also determines the origin and coordinates of the predetermined CAD window by communicating with CAD system <b>10</b>. The size and location coordinates of the window determine whether all or a particular portion of the raster image is to be displayed.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The raster image is different from the vector-based image in that the raster image is stored in the system memory by a predetermined bit map corresponding to the number of picture elements (pixels) which can be displayed by display device <b>16</b>. Each screen display typically has associated therewith a predetermined number of pixels along a horizontal axis and a predetermined number of pixels along a vertical axis. The number of pixels along the vertical axis may be different from the number of pixels along the horizontal axis. Each screen pixel is assigned a particular location in memory and has a particular code associated therewith, which may include that the corresponding caster pixel is “off” and therefore appears in the background color (e.g., white) or that the corresponding pixel is “on” and therefore appears in the foreground color (e.g., black) of the display. Each pixel represents a predetermined position or “dot” on the display and is typically rectangular shaped.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">It is important that the raster image be maintained in the proper registration on the display screen with the CAD image which is created on the display screen by the user. The CAD inputs are stored in vector database <b>18</b> and are also reproduced on the screen display, superimposed on top of the raster image. In this manner, the changes which the user desires to make in the raster image are shown on top of the raster image on the screen. The changes are implemented using standard CAD commands.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">What appears on the screen represents a composite image with both raster and vector elements shown. The vector elements represent the CAD generated changes. Alternatively, the user may reproduce the raster image as a CAD image by simply tracing over the raster image using the proper sequence of CAD commands, thereby producing a vector-based image and eliminating the need for the raster image. The operation of resident link program <b>20</b> and transient link program <b>22</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an edit program <b>30</b> is used to merge the CAD system inputs, which are stored in vector database <b>18</b>, with the original raster image, which is stored in raster database <b>24</b>, in accordance with another aspect of the invention. Edit program <b>30</b> will generate a new raster database <b>32</b> in which an updated raster image is stored, which represents the original raster image as edited by the CAD commands. The new raster data may be compressed using a conventional utilities program, as indicated at <b>34</b>. The raster data, which may be either compressed or decompressed, is transmitted to a plot program <b>38</b>, which controls a raster plotter <b>40</b>. Raster plotter <b>40</b> is used to generate a hard copy of the updated raster image. The new raster data may be decompressed, as indicated at <b>42</b>, and stored in raster database <b>24</b> for further processing. The operation of edit program <b>30</b> will be described in greater detail below, with reference to FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the resident link program is initialized in a conventional DOS operating system, such as PC/DOS or MS/DOS. The DOS operating system includes an interrupt vector table, a particular location of which is dedicated to a display driver. If there is no valid display driver interrupt address present, an error message will be generated and the program operation is terminated. If a valid display driver interrupt address is present in the interrupt vector table, the resident link program will be mapped to this address and the display driver interrupt command will be remapped to a clear location in the interrupt vector table. As a result of this operation, the resident link program will assume the location in the interrupt vector table previously occupied by the display driver which is used by the CAD system to effect changes to the screen display.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">Initial display parameters, such as the location of the origin of the display and the display scale and color, are transmitted by the resident link program to the display driver. The resident link program then starts the execution of the CAD system and waits for a display driver interrupt command from the CAD system.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a display driver interrupt command will be generated by the CAD system when the user wants to make changes to the screen display. Because the resident link program now services the display driver interrupt, the resident link program will intercept each CAD command and determine whether what particular command affects the raster image controlled by the link program. If the command does not affect the raster image, the intercepted command is sent directly to the display driver and the resident link program will wait for a subsequent display driver interrupt command.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">If, on the other hand, the CAD command does affect the raster image, the resident link program will load the transient link program, which will respond to the CAD command, as shown in the remainder of FIG. <b>3</b>B and in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C-3E</figref>. If the incoming command is not a “CLEAR SCREEN” command, which clears the entire graphics display, the transient link program will process the command in accordance with the sequence of steps set forth in FIG. <b>3</b>C.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, if the CAD command indicates “TERMINATE”, then no additional CAD commands will be forthcoming, at least for the present time. In that event the raster settings, such as the origin, scale and display color, will be saved for future processing and the link program execution will terminate. If the incoming command does not indicate that the CAD system is terminating, the transient link program will determine whether the incoming command is a “STATUS COMMAND”. If a “STATUS COMMAND” is indicated, the raster settings will be displayed on the screen in text for viewing by the operator and the program will branch back to the beginning of FIG. <b>3</b>B and wait for another CAD command.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">If a “STATUS COMMAND” is not indicated, the program will determine whether a “RASTER SETTINGS COMMAND” is being sent. If so, one or more of the raster settings, such as the color of the foreground or background of the raster display, the raster origin and the raster (i.e., ratio of pixel dots to raster image units) will be changed in accordance with the particular “RASTER SETTINGS COMMAND”. If a “RASTER SETTINGS COMMAND” is not indicated, the program will branch back to the beginning of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> to wait for a subsequent CAD command.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, if a “CLEAR SCREEN” command is sent by the CAD system, the transient link program will determine the size and location of the CAD window by addressing the CAD system to determine the Cartesian coordinates (x, y) of two diametrically opposite corner points of the rectangular CAD window. For example, the transient link program will determine the x, y coordinates of the lower left corner point of the rectangular window and the x, y coordinates of the upper right corner point of the window. The x, y coordinates of the boundary points of the window are referenced to a predetermined CAD origin, which is established at a predetermined position on the display screen or off the display screen. The default position of both the raster origin and the CAD origin is at the lower left corner of the display screen. The coordinates are expressed in terms of “world” units (e.g., inches) relative to the origin along both the X and Y axes. The size and location of the window determines the particular portion, if any, of the image which will be displayed on the screen.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, once the boundaries of the window are determined, the zoom ratios along both the X and Y axes are computed to determine the area of the raster expanded file which will be displayed. The zoom ratio along the X axis is the ratio of a first quantity, which represents the number of screen pixels along the horizontal (X) axis of the display divided by the distance in “world” units (e.g., inches) between the right and left boundaries of the window, to a second quantity, which represents the number of raster pixels per unit (i.e., the raster scale). Similarly, the zoom ratio along the Y axis is the ratio of a first quantity, which represents the number of screen pixels along the vertical (Y) axis of the display divided by the distance in “world” units between the top and bottom boundaries of the window, to a second quantity, which represents the raster scale.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Typically, the number of screen pixels along a particular axis and the raster scale are constant. Therefore, the corresponding zoom ratio will vary as the extent of the window varies along a particular axis. The raster expanded file is stored in the raster database and represents the entire raster image. Each pixel comprising the raster image is assigned discrete x, y coordinates in “world” units so that all pixels falling within the window boundaries will be displayed. In this manner, the raster image is always maintained in registration with the CAD image.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">The portion of the raster image to be displayed is moved from a raster image buffer to a display image buffer, if the size and location of the window are unchanged. If the size and/or location of the window are changed, the raster image buffer must be changed to match the size and location of the new CAD window in accordance with the procedure set forth in FIG. <b>3</b>E.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the zoom ratios are used to scale the section of the raster image being displayed either up or down to fit the display window. For example, if the zoom ratio along a particular axis is approximately 1:1, the section of the raster file to be displayed is copied directly to the raster image buffer. If the zoom ratio is less than 1:1, the number of screen pixels per unit is less than the number of raster pixels per unit and the section of the raster image to be displayed must be scaled up to fit the boundaries of the window, and the zoomed image is placed into the raster image buffer. If the zoom ratio is greater than 1:1, the number of screen pixels per unit is greater than the number of raster pixels per unit and the section of the raster image to be displayed is scaled down to fit the window and the zoomed image is placed in the raster image buffer.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">With the raster image, or a selected portion thereof, displayed on the screen, the operator has a reference image which he can use to implement changes and/or additions to the raster image or trace directly over the raster image to produce a substantially identical CAD image. One skilled in the art will appreciate that being able to superimpose a CAD image directly over the raster image with standard CAD commands facilitates the production of a desired drawing design.</p>
  <p num="p-0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a raster-based image <b>44</b>, which may appear on a sheet of paper or other hard copy. The document can be scanned to load the raster image into the raster database, as previously described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates changes made in the raster image directly on screen using CAD commands. The dashed lines, as indicated at <b>46</b>, represent the changes in the image made by the operator using the CAD system. The CAD image typically appears in at least two colors. One color is the same as the background color of the raster image so that when portions of the raster image displayed in the foreground color are overlaid by the CAD image in the background color, those portions of the raster image will visually appear to have been erased from the screen. The other color is different from the background color and is used to effect additions to the raster image at the positions where this other color overlays the portions of the raster image displayed in the background color. The raster image is always maintained in registration with the CAD image so that the CAD changes will appear at the proper positions on the original raster image.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the raster image can be removed from the screen so that only the CAD generated image appears. The image <b>47</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> represents the image stored in the vector database associated with the CAD system and also corresponds to the dashed lines in FIG. <b>4</b>B. The edit program, described below, merges the CAD generated changes with the original raster image to create a new, updated raster image, as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>D. The updated raster image can then be reproduced in hard copy form with a raster plotter or the like, as previously described. Attentively, the operator can create a CAD image, which is a duplicate of the raster image by tracing over the portion of the raster image which appears in the foreground color using a color other than the background color of the raster image.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the edit program will create a raster file in memory in which the raster image is stored. If the entire raster image cannot fit within the available memory space, the raster image will be examined in individual sections. A plot file is also established, which contains the CAD generated changes to the raster image. The vectors representing the CAD image are converted to bit-map pixels or raster pixels in the plot file.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">Each of the raster file pixels and the plot file pixels has defined coordinates relative to the predetermined origin. The edit program will examine all of the raster pixels to determine which pixels need to be turned “on” or “off”. If a particular raster pixel is overlaid by CAD system vectors which are drawn in the CAD system using a specific color (pen number) which matches the background color of the raster image, that particular pixel will be “erased” (i.e., turned “off”), as will all such other raster pixels overlaid by a CAD vector drawn in the background color of the raster image. Similarly, all raster pixels in the “off” state which are overlaid by CAD system vectors drawn in a color other than the background color of the raster image will be turned “on”. The reminder of the raster image which is not overlaid by any portion of the CAD image will remain unchanged. After these changes are effected, the new, updated raster image, which incorporates the CAD changes, will be stored for future use. Alternatively, CAD functions other than color (pen number) that are associated with the vectors, such as layer or level, can be used to indicate that portions of the raster are to be erased or added to, as the case may be.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, an alternate embodiment of the system and method for manipulating scanned documents using computer aided design commands, according to the present invention, is illustrated. The system is substantially the same as the system illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, except that link program <b>48</b> is not interposed between CAD system <b>50</b> and the display driver as is the case in the system illustrated in FIG. <b>2</b>A. Instead, link program <b>48</b>, which includes both the resident and transient portions of the program, communicates via an interprocess communication path (e.g., pipe) with CAD system <b>50</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">CAD system <b>50</b> sends all commands affecting link program <b>48</b> directly thereto, rather than having the link program intercept the commands from the CAD system, as in the system illustrated in FIG. <b>2</b>A. The arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> is typically implemented in connection with a UNIX-based operating system, whereas the system illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> is typically implemented in a DOS-based operating system. Also, a display manager <b>52</b>, which is a sophisticated version of a display driver, is used in the UNIX-based system to control display device <b>54</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">One skilled in the art will appreciate that a raster image will provide better resolution than a vector-based image, particularly when the image is zoomed in to display small portions thereof. Furthermore, by maintaining the raster image in the background in registration with the CAD image, the operator can quickly and accurately produce a CAD image which duplicates the raster image by simply tracing over the raster image or, alternatively, make changes to the raster image using CAD commands. As a result, the system and method according to the present invention allow an operator to manipulate raster-based, scanned documents using standard compute aided design commands, which substantially reduces the time and expense associated with the production of design drawings and other graphic displays, both on screen and in hard copy form.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">Various embodiments of the invention have now been described in detail. Since it is obvious that many changes in and additions to the above-described preferred embodiment may be made without departing from the nature, spirit and scope of the invention, the invention is not to be limited to said detail, except as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
