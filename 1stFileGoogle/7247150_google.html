A unitary retainer desirably includes a base connected to a cover by way of a flexible hinge. The retainer is attached to a flexible anchor pad including an adhesive bottom surface, which can be attached to the patient's skin. A catheter is secured to a fitting, which in turn mounts to the retainer. Mounting the fitting to the retainer can be accomplished by inserting posts of the retainer through holes of the fitting, or by mounting the fitting within a channel defined by mounting structures integral to the retainer. The cover is then positioned over the base, by bending the flexible hinge, and latched to the base. Several embodiments of the latching mechanism are disclosed. In one form, the latching mechanism includes one or more posts on the base which can be releasably locked into corresponding slotted holes in the cover.</div>

<heading>RELATED CASES</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/209,209, filed 30 Jul. 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,929,625, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/797,341, filed 1 Mar. 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,485, which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/865,231, filed 29 May 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,213,979, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates to anchoring systems for anchoring medical lines to patients.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
  <p num="p-0006">It is very common in the treatment of patients to utilize intravenous (IV) catheters to introduce fluids and medications directly into the bloodstream. In many cases, and particularly with respect to cardiac therapy, the IV catheter is introduced into a central or larger vein located close to the patient's heart. A typical catheter utilized in connection with a central vein is referred to as a “central venous catheter” (“CVC”). A venous catheter peripherally inserted into the central circulation through a vein in the arm is commonly referred to as a “peripherally inserted central catheter” (“PICC”).</p>
  <p num="p-0007">In these cases, long-term IV infusion typically requires that the catheter remain in place for many days. In order to secure such an IV catheter in position at the insertion site, the catheter often is provided with an integrated or a movable flexible clamp with winged extensions which are sutured to the patient's skin. In other applications, the flexible clamp is covered by a rigid box clamp, which receives the catheter/clamp combination in a friction-fit manner. The rigid box clamp and the flexible clamp have lateral, aligned holes in them, which allow the combination to be sutured to the patient's skin. Although this technique securely attaches the central venous catheter to the patient, it obviously is painful and uncomfortable for the patient. This prior retention procedure is also time consuming and inconvenient, poses the risk of needle-stick to the health care provider, and risks suture-site infection to the patient. In addition, suture material tends to exhibit poor gripping on medical tubes and can cut through the winged extension of the flexible clamp.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0008">A need therefore exists for a simply-structured anchoring system that affixes a medical line in a fixed position, but releases the medical line for dressing changes or other servicing.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">On aspect of the present invention thus involves an anchoring system for securing a medical line to the body of a patient. The system comprises a retainer including a base that defines a receiving area for receiving a portion of the medical line. A cover is permanently coupled to the base. The cover is movable between a closed position, in which at least a portion of the cover extends over at least a portion of the receiving area, and an open position, in which the receiving area is at least partially open. A mechanism operates between the base and the cover to releasably the cover to the base with the cover in the closed position. Interacting structure is located generally beneath the cover with the cover in the closed position. The interacting structure is adapted to limit movement of the medical line through to the retainer when the catheter is placed within the receiving area.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Another aspect of the present invention involves an anchoring system for securing a medical line to the body of a patient. The system includes a fitting adapted to engage with the medical line and having at least one opening. A retainer comprises a base including a platform and at least one post extending from the platform and arranged to interact with the hole of the fitting. A cover is movably coupled to the base so as to be moved between an open position and a closed position. A latching mechanism operates between the cover and the base to releasably latch the cover to the base in the closed position.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">In accordance with an additional aspect of the present invention, an anchoring system for securing a medical line to the body of a patient is provided. The anchoring system comprises an adaptor having an adaptor body with a longitudinal axis defined between first and second ends. A first connector is located at the first end of the adaptor for connection to a first medical line, and a second connector is located at the second end for connection to a second medical line. A retainer includes a base and a cover permanently coupled to the base. The cover is movable between an open position and a closed position. A latching mechanism releasably latches the cover to the base in the closed position. And a channel is arranged to lie between the base and the cover in the closed position. The channel is shaped to retain the adaptor between the cover and the base with the cover in the closed position to inhibit movement of the adapter in a direction generally parallel to the adapter's longitudinal axis. An adhesive layer is attached to the retainer and is adapted to adhesively secure the retainer to the body of a patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">A preferred method of anchoring a medical line to a patient involves providing a retainer including a base having a plurality of posts, and a cover attached to the base by a flexible leash. The provided cover also includes a corresponding plurality of openings with each opening comprising a slot. The retainer is coupled to an adhesive layer. The anchoring system is positioned on the body of the patient, and the adhesive layer is attached to the body of the patient. A medical device is arranged between the posts of the base. The cover is positioned over the base to bring the openings of the cover in proximity with the posts of the base. The cover is shifted relative to the base to engage the posts with the slots of the openings.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Further aspects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description of the preferred embodiments that follow.</p>
<description-of-drawings> <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading> <p num="p-0014">The above-mentioned and other features of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings of several preferred embodiments of the present anchoring system. The illustrated embodiments of the anchoring system are intended to illustrate, but not to limit the invention. The drawings contain the following figures:</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0030">The present embodiments of the medical line anchoring system are disclosed in the context of an exemplary central line catheter. The principles of the present invention, however, are not limited to PICCs or CVCs. Instead, it will be understood by one of skill in this art, in light of the present disclosure, that the anchoring systems and retainers disclosed herein also can be successfully utilized in connection with other types of medical lines, including tubes for fluid communication and electrical wires. For example, but without limitation, the retainers disclosed herein can retain CVCs, PICCs, Foley catheters, and hemodialysis catheters, surgical drainage tubes, feeding tubes, chest tubes, nasogastric tubes, scopes, as well as with electrical wires or cables connected to external or implanted electronic devices or sensors. One skilled in the art may also find additional applications for the devices and systems disclosed herein. Thus, the illustration and description of the anchoring system <b>8</b> in connection with a catheter is mainly exemplary of one possible application of the system.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">Each of the embodiments described herein employ the same basic concepts characteristic of the improved anchoring system, namely releasable attachment of a medical line to a patient. The anchoring systems also all include interacting structure that operates between a retainer of the anchoring system and a fitting which in some applications is releasably attached to the medical line and in other applications is integrally formed with the medical line. The interacting structure between the retainer and the fitting generally inhibits relative movement between the medical line and the anchoring system in at least one degree of freedom.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">To assist in the description of the components of the anchoring systems and retainers disclosed herein, the following coordinate terms are used. A longitudinal axis is generally parallel to a section of the medical line to be retained by the anchoring system, generally in the plane of a retainer base (discussed below). A lateral axis is generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis within the plane of the base. A transverse axis extends transverse to both the longitudinal and lateral axes. A number of the figures illustrate this coordinate system to the side of the anchoring system. In addition, as used herein, the “longitudinal direction” refers to a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis. “The lateral direction” refers to a direction substantially parallel to the lateral axis. And, “the transverse direction” refer to a direction substantially parallel to the transverse axis. These coordinates are used to describe structures and movement of the anchoring system of each embodiment. A detailed description of each embodiment, and its associated method of use, now follows.</p>
  <p num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> illustrate an anchoring system <b>8</b> constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>8</b> includes a retainer <b>10</b> which is configured to retain a catheter, either directly or by way of a fitting <b>11</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the fitting <b>11</b> comprises a catheter box clamp <b>12</b> and a soft wing clamp <b>13</b> for use with a central line catheter <b>15</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">The retainer <b>10</b> includes a base <b>14</b>. The base <b>14</b> of the retainer <b>10</b> is attached to an anchor pad <b>16</b>, which forms a part of the anchoring system <b>8</b>. The base <b>14</b> desirably is secured to the anchor pad <b>16</b> by a solvent bond adhesive, such as cyanoacrylate or other bonding material. One such adhesive is available commercially as Part No. 4693 from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M).</p>
  <p num="p-0035">The anchor pad <b>16</b> comprises a flexible structural layer for securing the retainer <b>10</b> to a patient's skin. The pad desirably comprises a laminate structure with an upper cellulose foam layer (e.g., closed-cell polyethylene foam), and a bottom adhesive layer. The adhesive desirably is a medical-grade adhesive and can be either diaphoretic or nondiaphoretic, depending upon the particular application. Such foam with an adhesive layer is available commercially from New Dimensions in Medicine of Columbus, Ohio. Although not illustrated, it will be understood that the retainer and/or anchor pad can include suture holes in addition to the adhesive layer to further secure the anchor pad to the patient's skin.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">An upper surface of the foam layer is roughened by corona-treating the foam with a low electric charge. The roughened or porous upper surface of the anchor pad <b>16</b> improves the quality of the adhesive joint formed by the cyanoacrylate (or by another type of adhesive or bonding material) between the base <b>14</b> to the anchor pad <b>16</b>. In the alternative, the flexible anchor pad <b>16</b> can comprise a medical-grade adhesive bottom layer, an inner cellulose foam layer and an upper paper or other woven or non-woven cloth layer.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">A removable paper or plastic backing <b>17</b> desirably covers the bottom adhesive surface before use. The backing <b>17</b> preferably resists tearing and is divided into a plurality of pieces to ease attachment of the pad to a patient's skin. Desirably, the backing <b>17</b> is split along a center line <b>18</b> of the flexible anchor pad <b>16</b> in order to expose only half of the adhesive bottom surface at one time. The backing <b>17</b> also advantageously extends beyond at least one edge of the anchor pad <b>16</b>, as illustrated, to facilitate removal of the backing <b>17</b> from the adhesive layer.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">In the illustrated embodiment, the anchor pad <b>16</b> also desirably includes a pair of opposing concave sections that narrows the center of the anchor pad proximate to the base <b>14</b>. As a result, the peripheral ends of the anchor pad <b>16</b> have more contact area to provide greater stability and adhesion to a patient's skin, while allowing the retainer <b>10</b>, which is located at center section of the anchor pad <b>16</b>, to be placed adjacent to an insertion site of the catheter <b>15</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">Although the anchor pad <b>16</b> has not been shown in the other drawings that illustrates this embodiment, nor in some of the drawings illustrating the other embodiments, it will be understood that a similar flexible anchor pad is included to secure the retainer to the patent's skin with each embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">The base <b>14</b> and the catheter <b>15</b> desirably include interacting structure to couple the catheter <b>15</b> to the base <b>14</b>. As will be clear from the disclosure below, the interacting structure mounts the medical line either directly or by way of a fitting (e.g., the box clamp <b>12</b> and soft wing clamp <b>13</b>) to the base <b>14</b>. In the latter case, a portion of the interacting structure desirable is formed on the fitting and another portion of the interacting structure is formed on the retainer. The term “mount,” when used with reference to the relation between the catheter or fitting and the retainer, does not necessarily imply that the catheter <b>15</b> or fitting <b>11</b> are immobilized or fixed. Rather, this term is meant to describe the condition in which the interacting structure inhibits movement of the catheter <b>15</b> relative to the retainer <b>10</b> in at least one degree of freedom (e.g., rotational, lateral, longitudinal or transverse). In the illustrated embodiment, as well as in those later described, the interacting structure inhibits movement of the catheter <b>15</b> at least in the longitudinal direction.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">In the illustrated embodiment, a portion of the interacting structure on the base <b>14</b> comprises at least one post <b>20</b> which extends upwardly from a relatively rigid platform <b>21</b>. The base <b>14</b> desirably includes a pair of posts <b>20</b>. The base can also include additional posts to suit a specific application. For example, where the retainer is designed to secure a relatively large fitting, the base can include four posts arranged at the corners of a rectangle, for greater stability. And, three posts can be used to firmly anchor a Y-site fitting.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Each post <b>20</b> includes a shank or shaft <b>25</b>, attached to and extending upwardly from the platform <b>21</b>. The posts <b>20</b> can have a variety of lengths and a variety of distances between them, depending upon the particular application and the particular fitting <b>11</b> with which they are to interact to mount the catheter <b>11</b>. For anchoring catheters and medical tubing, each post <b>20</b> desirably has a length of about 4 mm to 20 mm, and more particularly a length of about 6 mm; however, longer or shorter lengths also are possible. The posts <b>20</b> are laterally spaced at least wide enough to accommodate the medical line to be anchored, and in the illustrated embodiments, the posts <b>20</b> are spaced to accommodate the fitting <b>11</b> which secures the medical line. Desirably, the posts <b>20</b> are spaced apart by a distance between 5 mm and 40 mm, and more particularly by a distance equal to about 15 mm. The shaft <b>25</b> of each post <b>20</b> has a diameter sufficient to perform its structural function, as described in more detail below, and depends upon the material chosen for the base <b>14</b> and shafts <b>25</b>. The illustrated posts <b>20</b> comprise a polymer plastic material, with a diameter between 0.5 mm and 3 mm and particularly about 1.7 mm.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">At least one protrusion extends radially from the shaft. In the illustrated embodiment, the protrusion comprises an enlarged tip or head <b>26</b> at the end distal from the platform <b>21</b>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, at least a portion of the head <b>26</b> of each post <b>20</b> is larger than the diameter of the shaft <b>25</b>, desirably having a maximum diameter of 1.1 to 1.5 times the diameter of the shaft <b>25</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the head <b>26</b> has a generally hemispherical shape with a smooth surface and a maximum diameter at an overhanging lower surface or underside <b>30</b>. It will be understood, however, that the head <b>26</b> can take a variety of other shapes, such as for example, solid or hollow conicals, arrowheads, barbs, spheres, mushroom heads, and other types of radially projecting structures. A relatively blunt end of the head <b>26</b> is preferred to avoid snagging on materials such as a health care provider's latex gloves or sheets on the patient's bed.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">A cover <b>22</b> is flexibly coupled to the base <b>14</b> by way of a flexible coupling. In the illustrated embodiment, the coupling comprises a flexible leash <b>24</b>. The leash <b>24</b> can take any number of forms to mechanically connect the base <b>14</b> to the cover <b>22</b> while permitting movement of the cover <b>22</b> relative to the base <b>14</b> so as to enable engagement or disengagement of these parts, as described below. In the illustrated embodiment, the leash <b>24</b> comprises a band of flexible material. The leash <b>24</b> desirably is integrally molded with the base <b>14</b> and the cover <b>22</b>. The illustrated leash <b>24</b> has a longitudinal width of about 0.5 mm to 5 mm, desirably about 1 mm, and a similar depth or transverse dimension. The length of the leash <b>24</b> depends in part upon the height of the post <b>20</b>. Desirably, the leash <b>24</b> is longer than the height of the post <b>20</b>, to allow some leeway in engaging or disengaging the base <b>14</b> with the cover <b>22</b>, as will be understood by one of skill in the art in light of the disclosure herein. While the leash <b>24</b> desirably is generally oblong in cross-section, as illustrated, and fixes an orientation of the cover <b>22</b> relative to the base <b>14</b>, it will be understood that the leash can also have a string-like (e.g., rounded) configuration and allow rotation about the lateral axis.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">The cover <b>22</b> comprises an elongate member which can be formed of the same polymer or plastic material as the base <b>14</b>, and desirably is integrally molded with the base <b>14</b>. The cover <b>22</b> desirably has a shape that is generally coextensive with the platform <b>21</b> of the base <b>14</b>. The cover <b>22</b> can be smaller; however, the cover should have a length in the lateral direction at least large enough to extend over the space between the posts <b>20</b> and a width in the longitudinal direction that is wider than the posts <b>20</b>. The width of the cover <b>22</b> desirably is sufficient to stabilize a section of the catheter <b>15</b> within the retainer <b>10</b>. In particular, the width of the cover <b>22</b> preferably generally matches the longitudinal length of the fitting <b>11</b>. The corners of the cover are also desirably rounded to avoid snagging on materials such as the latex gloves worn by the health care provider, bed sheets, etc. In the illustrated embodiment, the cover <b>22</b> generally has an elliptical shape for this purpose.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the illustrated cover <b>22</b> also desirably includes a textured portion <b>48</b>, such as that formed by longitudinal ridges <b>50</b> in the cover surface at an end of cover <b>22</b> opposite of the leach <b>24</b>. It will be understood that any well known form of texturing such as, for example, a roughened surface can be used in place of ridges. The textured portion <b>48</b> improves the health care provider's grip on the cover <b>22</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">The base <b>14</b> and cover <b>22</b> are further releasably connected by a latching mechanism. The latching mechanism permits the cover <b>22</b> to be engage with the base <b>14</b> in a closed position, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The cover <b>22</b> also can be disengaged from the base <b>14</b> and moved to an open position, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">The latching mechanism includes interengaging structures formed on the base <b>14</b> and on the cover <b>22</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the portion of the latching mechanism on the base <b>14</b> is formed by at least one of the posts <b>20</b> with it enlarged head <b>26</b>. Desirably, the latching mechanism involves the posts <b>20</b> that lie on opposite sides of the catheter <b>15</b> when the catheter <b>15</b> is properly positioned on the retainer <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">A cover portion of the latching mechanism includes at least one opening <b>32</b> formed in the cover <b>22</b>, and desirably includes the same number of openings <b>32</b> as there are posts <b>20</b> on the base <b>14</b>. The illustrated cover <b>22</b> thus includes two openings <b>32</b> with corresponding points of the openings <b>32</b> being spaced by approximately the same distance as the two posts <b>20</b> on the base <b>14</b>, desirably by between about 5 mm and 40 mm, and particularly about 15 mm. Each opening <b>32</b> is arranged in the cover <b>22</b> to cooperate with the corresponding post <b>20</b>. It will be understood that, in other arrangements of the latching mechanism are possible where the posts are on the cover, the openings are formed in the base, as described in more detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Each opening <b>32</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref> is defined by a central hole <b>34</b> with at least one slot <b>36</b> extending to one side, desirably laterally adjacent to and intersecting with the central hole <b>34</b> at a narrow waist opening <b>37</b>. The central hole <b>34</b> is sized and shaped to accommodate the largest diameter of the post head <b>26</b>. The illustrated slot <b>36</b> extends in the lateral direction from the central hole <b>34</b> with the lateral axis of the slot <b>36</b> being substantially collinear with a center line of the cover <b>22</b> extending in the lateral direction. It will be understood that the slots <b>36</b> on the cover <b>22</b> can extend from the central hole <b>34</b> in any direction, though both slots <b>36</b> desirably extend in the same general direction. In other arrangements, more than one slot can extend from each central hole.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">The width of the illustrated slot <b>36</b> in the longitudinal direction is smaller than the central hole <b>34</b> and is smaller than the largest diameter of the head <b>26</b>. The slot width desirably ranges from slightly smaller to slightly larger than the diameter of the shaft <b>25</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The interengagement between the posts <b>20</b> and the openings <b>32</b> on the cover <b>22</b> thus form the latching mechanism that releasably secures the cover <b>22</b> to the base <b>14</b>. When the post shaft <b>25</b> is positioned in the slot <b>36</b>, the cover <b>22</b> can not be lifted from the retainer base <b>14</b> in the transverse direction, as described in more detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">As best seen from the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the cover <b>22</b> desirably includes a post retention mechanism to inhibit unintentional retraction of a post <b>20</b> from the slot <b>36</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2–3</figref>, the retention mechanism includes a lip <b>38</b> of cover material that forms a depression <b>40</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The depression <b>40</b> is sized slightly smaller than the lower surface <b>30</b> of the post head <b>26</b>. The retention mechanism of the illustrated slotted hole <b>36</b> further comprises the waist opening <b>37</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>), which has a slightly smaller diameter than the shaft <b>25</b>. The longitudinal dimension of the slot <b>36</b> widens to slightly larger than the diameter of the shaft <b>25</b> between the lip <b>38</b> of the cover <b>22</b>. While not illustrated, the retention mechanism can also be formed by arranging the slots at a slight deviation from parallel to one another to increase the friction between the cover <b>22</b> and the posts <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">The retainer <b>10</b> also desirably includes a locator device to locate the cover <b>22</b> at a desired distance from the platform <b>21</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, each post <b>20</b> includes an annular ring <b>28</b> positioned between the platform <b>21</b> and the head <b>26</b> for this purpose; however, other types of protuberances (e.g., small bumps or ribs) can also serve this purpose. The annular ring <b>28</b> is spaced below the head <b>26</b> along the shaft <b>25</b> by a distance sufficient to accommodate the thickness of the cover <b>22</b> when latched together. The ring <b>28</b> desirably is located between about 1 mm and 4 mm below the lower surface <b>30</b> of the head <b>26</b>. Like the head <b>26</b>, the annual ring <b>28</b> is larger in diameter than the shaft <b>25</b>, desirably 1.1 to 2.0 times the diameter of the shaft <b>25</b>. Most desirably, the ring <b>28</b> is slightly larger than the maximum diameter of the head <b>26</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">As mentioned above, the base <b>22</b>, leash <b>24</b> and cover <b>22</b> desirably are integrally formed to make a unitary retainer <b>10</b>. This can be accomplished in any of a variety of ways well known to one of skill in the art. For instance, the entire retainer can be injection molded, in order to reduce fabrication costs. Additionally, features such as the leash <b>24</b> are desirably flexible. Suitable plastics which account for these considerations include polypropylene, polyethylene, and the like. Desirably, the illustrated retainer <b>10</b> comprises injection molded polyethylene or polypropylene.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">The anchoring system <b>8</b> can also include the fitting <b>11</b> for mounting a medical line (e.g., catheter) to the retainer <b>10</b>. In the exemplary application illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>, the fitting <b>11</b> takes the form of the box clamp <b>12</b> and the soft wing clamp <b>13</b>. Mounting of the fitting <b>11</b> (or catheter directly) to the retainer <b>10</b> is achieved by way of the interacting structures, a portion of which comprises surfaces or structures of the retainer <b>10</b> and another portion of which comprises surfaces or structures of the fitting <b>11</b> (or catheter, if directly coupled).</p>
  <p num="p-0057">The box clamp <b>12</b>, best seen from the view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is a relatively small, rigid wing-shaped device having a configuration similar to that of conventional box clamps in common usage today in suturing attachment systems. The box clamp <b>12</b> includes a central elongate body <b>60</b> having a longitudinal groove <b>62</b> formed on the underside and a box-shaped upper surface <b>64</b>. The longitudinal groove <b>62</b> is generally U-shaped and is sized to receive the body of a catheter and/or associated fluid line, and more desirably is sized to receive the wing clamp <b>13</b>. At least one end, and preferably at both ends of the longitudinal groove <b>62</b>, the body <b>60</b> of the box clamp <b>12</b> narrows the opening of the longitudinal groove <b>62</b>. That is, the longitudinal groove <b>62</b> at either end extends through an arc which is greater than 180 E about an axis of the longitudinal groove <b>62</b>. The groove also can have a uniform cross section along its length so that the wall of the entire groove extends through an arc greater than 180 E. The box clamp <b>12</b> desirably is formed of a relatively rigid material, such as polycarbonate.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">A pair of lateral wings <b>66</b> extend roughly perpendicularly from the body <b>60</b> of the box clamp <b>12</b>, each including a hole <b>67</b> therethrough. Each hole <b>67</b> is sized and shaped to receive the head <b>26</b> and the collar <b>28</b> of one of the posts <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">The soft wing clamp <b>13</b> has a configuration similar to that of the box clamp <b>14</b>, including a central elongate body <b>70</b> defining an inner cavity <b>72</b> and an outer surface <b>74</b>. The inner cavity <b>72</b> is sized to surround a portion of a catheter. The wing clamp <b>13</b> is constructed from a soft, pliable or flexible material such as, for example, latex or the like. The central elongate body <b>70</b> includes a longitudinal slit <b>75</b> along its underside. The slit <b>75</b> can be expanded due to the pliable nature of the wing clamp <b>13</b>. Thus, the wing clamp <b>13</b> is capable of being placed on and surrounding and longitudinally contacting in a frictional manner a portion of the catheter. This frictional contact between the soft wing claim <b>13</b> and the catheter generally prevents relative movement between these articles.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">Lateral wings <b>76</b> extend roughly perpendicularly from the body <b>70</b> of the soft wing clamp <b>13</b>, each including a through-hole <b>77</b>. Each hole <b>77</b> is sized and shaped to receive the head <b>26</b> of one of the posts <b>20</b>. As the material surrounding the wing hole <b>67</b> is pliable in the illustrated embodiment, the hole <b>67</b> can be smaller than the corresponding box clamp hole <b>67</b> and even smaller than the post head <b>26</b>, yet still be stretched to receive the post head <b>26</b>; the through-hole <b>77</b>, however, desirably is larger than the post head <b>26</b> and generally equal in size to the corresponding hole <b>67</b> in the box clamp <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">The illustrated box clamp <b>12</b> and soft wing clamp <b>13</b> are commercially available from Arrow® for use with its CVC. Other clamps with suture wing extensions are currently in commercial use with Quinton® Hemodialysis catheters, Cook® PICC's, Baxter® CVCs and B. Braun CVCs. The skilled artisan will find application for the present invention with any of these and many other clamp configurations. As will be clear from a discussion of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–12</figref>, the fitting <b>11</b> (box clamp/soft wing clamp combination) can also be replaced with an inter-line connector or adaptor, such as those used to connect the catheter to a supply, delivery or drainage line.</p>
  <p num="p-0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the interengagement of the components of the anchoring system <b>8</b>, in accordance with the present embodiment. The box clamp <b>12</b> and soft wing claim <b>13</b> are shown engaged with the posts <b>20</b> and retained between the base <b>14</b> and cover <b>22</b> of the retainer <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">As noted, the groove <b>62</b> of the box clamp <b>12</b> is configured to receive the soft wing clamp <b>13</b>. In particular, the groove <b>62</b> is sized and shaped to receive the outer surface <b>74</b> of the elongate body <b>74</b> on the soft wing clamp <b>13</b>. The wings <b>66</b> of the box clamp <b>12</b> have approximately the same size and shape as the wings <b>76</b> of the soft wing clamp <b>13</b>. When the wings <b>66</b>, <b>76</b> are aligned, the box clamp holes <b>67</b> are correspondingly aligned with the soft wing clamp holes <b>77</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">Together, the box clamp <b>12</b> and the soft wing clamp <b>13</b> form the fitting <b>11</b> for mounting in the retainer <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the retainer <b>10</b> has been sized for retention of the conventional box clamp <b>12</b> and soft wing clamp <b>13</b>. Accordingly, the holes <b>67</b>, <b>77</b> of the fitting <b>11</b> are spaced by approximately the same distance as the posts <b>20</b> on the retainer base <b>14</b>. The box-like upper surface <b>64</b> of the box clamp <b>12</b> is sized and shaped to fit between the posts <b>20</b>. Accordingly, a lateral dimension of the elongate body <b>60</b> is smaller than the spacing between the posts <b>20</b> (i.e., the elongate body <b>60</b> is located between and spaced from holes <b>67</b> on the box clamp wings <b>66</b>), while the height of the fitting <b>11</b> (formed by the height of the box clamp <b>12</b> plus the thickness of the soft wing clamp wings <b>76</b>) is smaller than the height of the posts. Desirably, the height of the fitting is smaller than the height of the shaft <b>25</b> up to the underside <b>30</b> of the post head.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">The interaction between the posts <b>20</b> and the openings <b>67</b>, <b>77</b> of the fitting <b>11</b> mount the fitting <b>11</b> on the base <b>14</b>. Accordingly, this interacting structure between the retainer <b>10</b> and the fitting <b>11</b> inhibits movement of the catheter <b>15</b> relative to the retainer <b>11</b> in at least the longitudinal and lateral directions. It is understood that the posts need not to extend entire through the holes for this purpose, though.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">As noted above, the spacing between the posts <b>20</b> on the base <b>14</b> also dictates the spacing between the openings <b>32</b> in the cover <b>22</b>. Desirably, the slots <b>36</b> each extend from the same side, and desirably laterally, from the central holes <b>34</b>. Thus, the spacing between the central holes <b>34</b> is approximately equal to the spacing between the slots <b>36</b>, which is in turn approximately equal to the spacing between the posts <b>20</b> on the base.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">As also noted above, the leash <b>24</b> flexibly connects the platform <b>21</b> of the base <b>14</b> to the cover <b>22</b>. Desirably, the leash <b>24</b> connects lateral ends of the base <b>14</b> and cover <b>22</b>, so as not to interfere with the mounting of the fitting <b>11</b> and catheter along the longitudinal axis. The leash <b>24</b> is long enough to permit a desired parallel spacing of the base <b>14</b> from the cover <b>22</b> when the retainer is in a closed position, as illustrated.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">In operation, a catheter (or other medical tube or wire) is inserted into the patient, and the fitting <b>11</b> is secured to the catheter. The fitting <b>11</b> is then retained within the retainer <b>10</b>, and the retainer <b>10</b> is then secured to the patient. These steps are described in more detail below. While this sequence is advantageous, it will be understood that, in other arrangements, the fitting can be secured to a catheter before or after securing the fitting to the retainer, depending upon the form of the fitting. Similarly, and especially for reapplication of a catheter to the retainer <b>10</b>, the catheter and fitting <b>11</b> can be mounted to the retainer <b>10</b> after the retainer <b>10</b> has already been secured to the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">In the illustrated embodiment, desirably after catheter insertion, the wing clamp <b>13</b> is stretched open at the slit <b>75</b> and fit over the catheter, as in standard practice. The groove <b>62</b> of the box clamp <b>12</b> is fitted over the elongate body <b>70</b> of the soft wing clamp <b>13</b>, providing a tight “snap fit.” Some flexibility in the wing clamp body <b>70</b> facilitates this fitting. The relatively more rigid box clamp body <b>60</b>, however, exerts relatively more inward pressure on the catheter than the relatively more flexible wing clamp <b>13</b>, such that a better frictional grip holds the catheter within the fitting <b>11</b>. It will be understood by one of skill in this art, however, that the fitting <b>11</b> of the present embodiment can comprise the soft wing clamp <b>13</b> alone.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the catheter and fitting <b>11</b> are then removably mounted to the retainer <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the holes <b>77</b>, <b>67</b> are fitted over the posts <b>20</b> of the retainer base <b>14</b>. Desirably, each slightly smaller wing clamp hole <b>77</b> stretches to accommodate the larger diameter head <b>26</b> and ring <b>28</b> of the post <b>20</b>. Each box clamp hole <b>67</b>, on the other hand, desirably is large enough to receive the head <b>26</b> and ring <b>28</b> without interference. The fitting <b>11</b> is thereby fitted onto the base <b>14</b> with the posts <b>20</b> extending through the fitting holes <b>67</b>, <b>77</b> and the bottom surface of the soft wing clamp <b>13</b> resting on the platform <b>21</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the cover <b>22</b> is latched to the base <b>14</b>, with the fitting <b>11</b> interposed between the cover and the base. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the cover <b>22</b> in a partially closed position, with the flexible leash <b>24</b> bent to position the cover <b>22</b> over the base <b>14</b>. The openings <b>32</b> of the cover <b>22</b> are aligned with the posts <b>20</b> of the base <b>14</b> and the cover <b>22</b> is then moved toward the base such that the head <b>26</b> of each post passes through the central hole <b>34</b> of one of the openings <b>32</b>. The size and spacing of the openings <b>32</b> and the posts <b>22</b> should result in an easy engagement so that only a light downward force is necessary, thereby avoiding pain or discomfort to the patient. In this position, the portion of the cover <b>22</b> between the holes <b>34</b> can firmly contact a portion of the fitting <b>11</b> in some applications.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">The rings <b>28</b> can also support, at least in part, the cover <b>22</b>, or at least limit the travel of the cover <b>22</b> over the posts <b>20</b> so as to properly position the cover <b>22</b> on the posts <b>22</b> generally beneath the flared heads <b>26</b>. Once the heads <b>26</b> of the posts <b>20</b> have cleared the central holes <b>34</b> in the cover <b>22</b>, the cover <b>22</b> contacts the ring <b>28</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The cover <b>22</b> is then slid laterally (to the right, in the views of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) so that the shaft <b>25</b> of each post <b>20</b> slides past the narrow waist opening <b>37</b> into the corresponding slot <b>36</b>. The cover material at the waist <b>37</b> and/or the shaft <b>25</b> slightly compresses as the cover <b>22</b> is shifted under force provided by the health care provider. Desirably, the retainer is arranged such that, when the posts <b>20</b> are engaged with the slots <b>36</b>, the cover <b>22</b> is centered with respect to the base.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">The resulting engagement, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, serves to retain the fitting <b>11</b> securely in place within the retainer <b>10</b>. As the waist openings <b>37</b> are desirably slightly more narrow than the post shafts <b>25</b>, the slots <b>36</b> provide a friction or snap fit engagement with the posts <b>20</b>. The slots <b>36</b> are longitudinally more narrow than the post heads <b>26</b>, such that the cover <b>22</b> cannot be transversely lifted away from the base <b>14</b> in this position. Surfaces of the post <b>20</b> abut against surfaces of the cover <b>22</b> formed by the lip <b>38</b> and walls <b>46</b> of the opening <b>32</b>. The posts <b>20</b> of the base <b>14</b> and the slotted holes <b>67</b>, <b>77</b> of the cover <b>22</b> thereby form a latching structure. The latching structure allows the posts <b>20</b> to be easily inserted into the openings <b>32</b> in one position but inhibits unintentional retraction of the posts <b>20</b> from the openings <b>32</b> in a second position.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">Additionally, the underside <b>30</b> of the post head <b>26</b> seats against the cover <b>22</b> with the periphery of the head <b>26</b> at the edge of the depression <b>40</b>, as shown. A slight deformation of the head <b>26</b> and/or edge of the depression <b>40</b> creates increased interference between the cover <b>22</b> and the post heads <b>26</b> which aids in maintaining the cover <b>22</b> in place, relative to the posts <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">It will be understood that, in other arrangements, the openings can instead be formed in the base, rather than the cover, and the posts formed on the cover. In such a case, each opening would comprise a partial central hole in the base, below which a hollow space is formed for receiving the heads of downward extending posts of the cover. The space would also accommodate the lateral movement of the cover (and consequent lateral movement of the posts) in order to provide engagement between the shaft of each post and a narrow slot extending from the opening. In this manner, the head of one of the posts would be captured within the hollow space below each slot. The post could not be pulled out of the hollow space because the rear side of the post head would contact the portions of the base which define the slot. Such a latching mechanism is disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 08/587,092, entitled “Catheter Anchoring System”, filed on Jan. 15, 1996, in the name of Steven F. Bierman and assigned to the assignee hereof, which stands allowed as of the filing date of this application and which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">In initial application, the illustrated retainer <b>10</b>, with the fitting <b>11</b> and the catheter retained in it as described above, is secured to the patient by way of the self-adhesive anchor pad <b>16</b>. The health care provider selects a skin site on which the retainer <b>10</b> will be attached. For use with CVCs and PICCs, the retainer <b>10</b> desirably is applied to the skin of the patient in the vicinity of the catheter insertion site. The health care provider then cleanses and prepares the anticipated dressing site according to well known methods, usually swabbing with alcohol and allowing the site to dry thoroughly. The health care provider peels away half of the backing layer <b>17</b> from the adhesive surface of the anchor pad <b>16</b>, properly locates the pad <b>16</b> on the patient, and presses the exposed adhesive against the patient's skin to secure the anchor pad <b>16</b> to the patient. The second half of the backing layer <b>17</b> is then removed, and the second half of the anchor pad <b>17</b> adhered to the patient's skin. The anchor pad <b>16</b> should be mounted on the patient so that catheter overlies the retainer <b>10</b> along the retainer's longitudinal axis.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">When removal of the catheter becomes necessary, the cover <b>22</b> simply is slid horizontally in the opposite direction, desirably with force sufficient to compress cover material at the waists <b>37</b>, so that the heads <b>26</b> of the posts <b>20</b> are once again aligned with the central holes <b>34</b>. The cover <b>22</b> can then be easily lifted transversely from the base <b>14</b>. With the retainer <b>10</b> thus unlatched, the fitting <b>11</b> can also be removed. The catheter secured by the fitting <b>11</b> can then be changed or cleaned and replaced in the retainer <b>10</b>, without requiring a new retainer.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">It should be noted that a deliberate effort is generally required to disengage the post shafts <b>25</b> from the slots <b>36</b>, due to the retention mechanism formed by the narrow neck <b>37</b> and/or depression <b>40</b>. The retainer <b>10</b> thus releasably mounts a catheter (or other medical line) and can be reused without requiring reattachment to the patient, while at the same time inhibiting accidental release of the catheter.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">Significantly, the removed cover <b>22</b> remains leashed to the retainer base <b>14</b>, which remains attached to the patient. Thus, the health care provider need not take care to place the cover <b>22</b> in a safe hygienic place, nor keep track of its whereabouts. The cover <b>22</b> can simply hang from the base <b>14</b> by the leash <b>24</b>, where it is easily found and relatched to the base <b>14</b> when a new catheter is engaged. Furthermore, each time the cover is relatched, the cover <b>22</b> is automatically correctly oriented, such that the health care provider need not take care to ensure that the depression <b>40</b> is facing the correct direction, nor to ensure that the slots <b>36</b> are on the correct side.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">Of course, if the medical treatment is completed and there is no need to reuse the retainer <b>10</b>, the health care provider can release the cover from the base in the manner described above. The medical article then can be lifted from the base. To remove the anchor pad <b>16</b>, the health care provider lifts an edge of the pad <b>16</b> and gently strokes the undersurface with an alcohol swab while slowly but continuously lifting the edge. The anchor pad <b>16</b> can be peeled from the patient's skin in this manner. The health care provider then cleanses and prepares skin using well known hospital or agency protocols.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">A retainer <b>10</b> <i>a </i>in accordance with another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 5</figref>, with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> showing a completely open position of the retainer <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showing the partially closed position, similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–2</figref> above. Though not illustrated, this retainer <b>10</b> <i>a </i>also desirably includes a flexible anchor pad, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for adhesive attachment to the body of a patient. Only the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>of this embodiment differs from the above-described embodiment. Accordingly, the above description applies equally to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4–5</figref>, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, like reference numerals are used to indicate like features of the two embodiments, with the letter “a” added as a suffix to refer to features of the present embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">The cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>of this retention mechanism <b>14</b> <i>a </i>includes a pair of openings <b>32</b> <i>a</i>. In contrast to the embodiment discussed above, each opening <b>32</b> <i>a </i>comprises a single slot <b>80</b> extending from a longitudinal outer edge <b>82</b> of the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>to a terminus <b>84</b>. The pair of slots <b>80</b> can extend from either of the two outer edges <b>82</b>, but both slots <b>80</b> desirably extend from the same edge.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">The slots <b>80</b> advantageously extend obliquely from the outer edge <b>82</b> of the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>to the slot terminus <b>84</b>, such that one side of each slot <b>80</b> defines an obtuse angle α (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) with the outer edge <b>82</b> from which the slot extends, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The termini <b>84</b> of the slots <b>80</b> desirably are centered on or close to a lateral line that bisects the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>into longitudinal halves. Thus, the length of each slot <b>80</b> depends upon the obtuse angle α between the outer edge <b>82</b> and the slot <b>80</b>. The angle α should be small enough and the slot <b>80</b> short enough that the structural integrity of the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>is not compromised. While illustrated as parallel, the slots <b>80</b> can also be arranged at a slight angle to one another. The width of each slot <b>80</b> desirably is slightly larger than the diameter of the post shaft <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, and smaller than the largest dimension of the post head <b>26</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0085">As best seen from the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the opening <b>32</b> <i>a </i>desirably includes a retention mechanism, such as to inhibit retraction of the post <b>20</b> <i>a </i>from the slot <b>80</b>. As visible from the views of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 5</figref>, each slot <b>80</b> is partially defined at the terminus <b>84</b> by a lip <b>38</b> <i>a </i>of cover material, forming a depression <b>40</b> <i>a </i>in the cover <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, similar to the lip <b>38</b> and depression <b>40</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>. The depression <b>40</b> <i>a </i>is sized slightly smaller than the lower surface <b>30</b> <i>a </i>of the post head <b>26</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0086">In the illustrated embodiment, the retention mechanism further comprises one or more protuberances <b>86</b> extending at certain positions from interior walls of the slot <b>80</b>. As illustrated, the protuberances <b>86</b> desirably are positioned within the slot <b>80</b> just outside the depression <b>40</b> <i>a</i>. At the protuberances <b>86</b>, the slot <b>36</b> <i>a </i>most desirably has a slightly smaller diameter than the shaft <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, while widening to slightly larger than the shaft <b>25</b> <i>a </i>at the lip <b>38</b> <i>a</i>. These protuberances <b>86</b> define the waist <b>37</b> <i>a </i>of the opening <b>32</b> <i>a </i>for the present embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0087"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the retainer <b>10</b> <i>a </i>in a partially closed position. The flexible leash <b>24</b> <i>a </i>has been bent to swing the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>counterclockwise (in the view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), bringing the openings <b>32</b> <i>a </i>in proximity to the posts <b>20</b> <i>a</i>. The cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>continues in a downward arc from the position of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and is shifted slightly out of alignment with the base <b>14</b> <i>a </i>until the edge openings of the openings <b>32</b> <i>a </i>at the longitudinal edge <b>82</b> are adjacent to the section of the posts <b>20</b> <i>a </i>between the head <b>26</b> <i>a </i>and the ring <b>28</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0088">While not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 5</figref>, a catheter fitting can first be mounted to the retainer <b>10</b> <i>a </i>prior to latching. For example, the fitting <b>11</b> <i>a </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref> can be first secured to the retainer. For such a case, the posts <b>20</b> <i>a </i>serve as a portion of an interacting structure and the holes <b>67</b> <i>a</i>, <b>77</b> <i>a </i>of the fitting <b>11</b> <i>a </i>serve as another portion of the interacting structure. The interacting structure thus mounts the fitting to the retainer to inhibit at least one degree of movement of the fitting relative to the retainer. Alternatively, a portion of the interacting structure can directly mount a catheter, without the intermediate fitting.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">The shaft <b>25</b> <i>a </i>of each post <b>20</b> <i>a </i>(between the head <b>26</b> <i>a </i>and the ring <b>28</b> <i>a</i>) can be easily inserted into the edge opening of the openings <b>32</b> <i>a </i>at the outer edge <b>82</b>. The cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>is then shifted obliquely such that the shafts <b>25</b> <i>a </i>slide along the slots <b>80</b>. The shafts <b>25</b> <i>a </i>and/or the protuberances <b>86</b> are compressed or the protuberances are deflected as the shafts <b>25</b> <i>a </i>slide past the protuberances <b>86</b>. After the shafts <b>25</b> <i>a </i>have passed the protuberances <b>86</b>, the shafts and/or the protuberances can regain their original shape such that the shafts snap into the position adjacent to the protuberances <b>86</b> and engage with the terminus <b>84</b> of the slots <b>80</b>. When the head <b>26</b> <i>a </i>is seated at the edge of the depression <b>40</b> <i>a</i>, the surfaces of the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>formed by the lip <b>38</b> <i>a </i>and the protuberances <b>86</b> of the slot <b>80</b> abut against the shaft <b>25</b> <i>a </i>of the post <b>20</b> <i>a</i>. The cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>is thus latched in a closed position.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">In order to remove the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>from the base <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, the sliding motion of the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>over the posts <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is simply reversed until the post shafts <b>25</b> <i>a </i>exit the openings <b>32</b> <i>a </i>at the outer edge <b>82</b> of the cover <b>22</b> <i>a</i>. Note that some deliberate force is generally required to overcome the retention mechanism. Namely, the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>is slightly depressed to disengage the underside of the head <b>26</b> <i>a </i>from the edge of the depression <b>40</b> <i>a</i>, and the cover <b>22</b> <i>a </i>is slid with sufficient force to deflect or compress the protuberances <b>86</b>. Any fitting secured therein can then be disengaged from the opened retainer <b>10</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0091">Where the slots are arranged at a slight angle to one another, the friction fit of the posts within the slots will improve, relative to an exactly parallel arrangement. It will be understood that, in other arrangements, a similar slot can extend perpendicularly from the longitudinal edge. Alternatively, slots of each opening can extend from opposite longitudinal edges of the cover. In the latter arrangement, the cover would be aligned longitudinally between the posts and the cover twisted to a lateral alignment, such that the posts each engage the slots on each side. As will be understood by one of skill in this art, such slots would desirably extend along the circumference of a circle centered between the termini.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">In either of the above illustrated embodiments, or in inverted arrangements with the posts on the cover, the posts serve both as an interacting structure (for mounting a medical line or fitting) and as a part of the latching structure (for latching the cover to the base). It will be understood, however, from the description of the following two embodiments, that the posts can serve only as part of the latching structure, or only as part of the interacting structure. It will further be understood by one of ordinary skill in this art that the posts can be absent altogether in other arrangements.</p>
  <p num="p-0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6–9</figref> illustrate a retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>is shown in an open position in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and in a fully closed and latched position in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Other components of the anchoring system <b>8</b> <i>b </i>(e.g., anchor pad, catheter adapter) can be the same as described above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>. Accordingly, the above description applies equally to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6–9</figref>, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, like reference numerals are used to indicate like features among the embodiments, with the letter “b” added as a suffix to refer to features of the present embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">The base <b>14</b> <i>b </i>includes a pair of posts <b>20</b> <i>b</i>; however, the base can include more or less posts depending upon the application of the anchoring system. Each post <b>20</b> <i>b </i>has a relatively smooth, continuous surface up to a tip <b>90</b> which need not protrude radially from the post <b>20</b> <i>b</i>, unlike the head <b>26</b>, <b>26</b> <i>a </i>of the previously described embodiments. The tip <b>90</b> of the post <b>20</b> <i>b </i>can be a flat surface or can taper into a hemispherical shape (as shown), a conical shape or other well known shapes. In the illustrated embodiment, the posts <b>20</b> <i>b </i>each consist only of a simple shaft tapered hemispherically at the tip <b>90</b>. The posts <b>20</b> <i>b </i>otherwise desirably have the same diameter, spacing, and height of the posts <b>20</b>, <b>20</b> <i>a </i>of the previous embodiments. The posts <b>20</b> <i>b </i>are illustrated as connected to a platform <b>21</b> <i>b </i>of the base <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, although it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, in light of the above disclosure, that the posts could be connected to the cover <b>22</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0095">The flexible hinge <b>24</b> <i>b </i>of this embodiment comprises a relatively rigid support arm <b>92</b> that is integrally joined to the platform <b>21</b> <i>b </i>at a base end <b>94</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the support arm <b>92</b> extends upwardly from the base end <b>94</b> to join with the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>at a thin bridge <b>96</b> of cover material. The bridge <b>96</b> is formed along a common exterior surface <b>98</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>and the support arm <b>92</b>. The bridge <b>96</b> is defined along the apex of a notch <b>100</b> in the material that forms the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>and support arm <b>92</b>. The notch <b>100</b> can be thought of as the structure formed by a beveled edge sloping away from an interior surface <b>102</b> of the cover <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, conjoined at the bridge <b>96</b> with a beveled edge sloping away from an inside surface <b>104</b> of the support arm <b>92</b>. The hinge <b>24</b> <i>b </i>flexibly connecting the base <b>14</b> <i>b </i>to the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>thus comprises the support arm <b>92</b>, the bridge <b>96</b>, and the surfaces forming the notch <b>100</b>. In other arrangements, however, the hinge of an embodiment resembling that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6–9</figref> can comprise a structure similar to a conventional hinge pin-bracket arrangement.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">Desirably, the support arm <b>92</b>, which terminates at an upper end at the bridge <b>96</b>, has the same height as the posts <b>20</b> <i>b</i>. It will be understood, however, that the support arm <b>92</b> can be higher than the posts <b>20</b> <i>b </i>in other arrangements.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">The thickness of the bridge <b>96</b> depends upon the material chosen, and is thick enough to provide the desired strength to connect the support arm <b>92</b> to the cover <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, but thin enough to provide flexibility for opening and closing the retainer <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. Desirably, the retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>is integrally injection molded of a resilient polymer material, such as polypropylene or polyethylene. For such materials, the bridge <b>96</b> has a thickness between about 0.5 mm and 2.5 mm, and desirably about 1.5 mm.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">The flexibility of the hinge <b>24</b> <i>b </i>also depends in part upon the angle formed by surfaces of the notch <b>100</b> when the retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>is in the open position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Desirably, the notch <b>100</b> defines an angle of at least about 90E, and particularly about 115E. Such an arrangement allows the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>to lie parallel to the platform <b>21</b> <i>b </i>when the retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>is in the closed position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. It will be understood, however, that in other arrangements the closed cover need not lie parallel to the platform <b>14</b> <i>b </i>(and may take a curvilinear path as described below).</p>
  <p num="p-0099">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the latching mechanism <b>110</b> <i>b </i>of the illustrated retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>comprising a fastening pin <b>112</b> and a latch having a receptacle <b>114</b>. The receptacle <b>114</b> is configured to receive the fastening pin <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6–9</figref>, the illustrated fastening pin <b>112</b> is integrally connected to the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>and the receptacle <b>114</b> is integrally connected to the base <b>14</b> <i>b</i>. It will be understood, however, that the pin can instead be positioned on the base, while the receptacle is positioned on the cover.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">The fastening pin <b>112</b> includes a bar <b>116</b> extending from the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>(or the base <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, depending on the position of the element). At the end distal from the connection to the cover <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, the bar <b>116</b> connects to an expanded portion or barb <b>118</b> which tapers to a terminus <b>120</b> of the pin <b>112</b>. Like the post head <b>26</b>, <b>26</b> <i>a </i>of the previous embodiments, the barb <b>118</b> of the fastening pin <b>112</b> can be formed in any of a variety of shapes such as an arrowhead (as shown), hemispherical, conical or flexible ribs extending outward from the bar <b>116</b>. Desirably, the terminus <b>120</b> of the fastening pin <b>112</b> is relatively blunt and smooth to prevent it from puncturing the gloves of a health care provider or catching on other materials. The barb <b>118</b> also desirably includes a sloping or curved surface <b>121</b> leading from the terminus <b>120</b> to the maximum diameter of the barb <b>118</b>. At least one shoulder is formed behind the barb <b>118</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, shoulders are defined on either side of the bar <b>116</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">The receptacle <b>114</b> of the latch <b>110</b> <i>b </i>comprises a pair of opposing tangs <b>122</b> that extend to a stem <b>124</b> connected to the base <b>14</b> <i>b </i>(or cover <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, depending on the position of this element of the latch). Each tang <b>122</b> extends outwardly to a lug <b>126</b> that can be depressed by finger pressure. Desirably, each tang <b>122</b> includes an inner beveled surface <b>127</b>. These beveled surfaces define an aperture <b>128</b> therebetween which tapers from a wider dimension at the top to a narrower dimension at the bottom, where it communicates with a slot <b>130</b> located between the opposing stems <b>124</b>. Each tang defines a downward facing shoulder that cooperates with one of the shoulders of the fastening pin barb <b>118</b>, as described below.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">In operation, a fitting, such as the fitting <b>11</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>, can be first engaged with the posts <b>20</b> <i>b </i>while the retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>is open (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Accordingly, the posts <b>20</b> <i>b </i>of the illustrated embodiment form a portion of the interacting structure for inhibiting movement of a medical line fitting relative to the retainer <b>10</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0103">The cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>can then swing to a closed position as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The relatively thin strip of material forming the bridge <b>96</b> allows the hinge <b>24</b> <i>b </i>to bend when finger pressure is exerted on the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>to lower it. The angle of the notch <b>100</b> further allows the cover <b>22</b> to be closed without compressing material between the interior surface <b>102</b> of the cover and the inner surface of the support arm <b>92</b>. While the rigid support arm <b>92</b> and the thin bridge <b>96</b> permit only rotational and not lateral movement of the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>relative to the base <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, such lateral movement is not necessary for the illustrated latching mechanism.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">The fastening pin <b>112</b> can be inserted into the receptacle <b>114</b> by positioning the pin <b>112</b> into the aperture <b>128</b> and pressing on the cover <b>22</b> <i>b</i>. The sloped surfaces <b>121</b> of the fastening pin <b>112</b> slide over the beveled inner surfaces <b>127</b> of the tangs <b>122</b>. The interaction of these sloped and beveled surfaces tends to distend the tangs <b>122</b> slightly, thereby allowing the barb <b>118</b> to enter the slot <b>130</b>. The tangs <b>122</b> then snap back into their original position and engage with the barb <b>118</b> of the pin <b>112</b> with the corresponding shoulders abutting, thereby releasably securing the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>to the base <b>14</b> <i>b</i>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the closed latch <b>10</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0105">When the latch <b>110</b> <i>b </i>is closed, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the inner surface <b>102</b> of the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>sits atop the tip <b>90</b> of the posts <b>20</b> <i>b</i>, since the posts of the illustrated retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>have the same height as the support arm <b>92</b>. It will be understood that, in arrangements where the posts are attached to the cover, the tips would abut the base when the cover is in the closed position and latched. Where such contact takes place, a fitting secured between the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>and the base <b>14</b> <i>b </i>could not slip off the posts <b>20</b> <i>b </i>when the retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>is closed and latched. Furthermore, the posts <b>20</b> <i>b </i>provide added support for the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>in the closed position to prevent over-extension of the hinge <b>24</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0106">To release the cover <b>22</b> <i>b </i>from the base <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, the health care provider can press down on the lugs <b>126</b>, thereby gaining access to the fitting and/or catheter secured therein. When a lug <b>126</b> is depressed, the attached stem <b>124</b> bends outward slightly, causing the tang <b>122</b> to moved outwardly and the slot <b>128</b> to expand, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. To provide friction between the health care provider's finger and the top of the lug <b>124</b>, ridges or other types of roughened surface can be included.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">When only a single lug <b>124</b> is depressed, however, the attached tang <b>122</b> is elevated until it contacts the surface of the element (e.g., the cover) to which the fastening pin <b>112</b> is connected. This degree of elevation of a single tang <b>122</b> does not expand the aperture <b>128</b> sufficiently to release the barb <b>118</b> of the fastening pin <b>112</b>. In contrast, when both lugs <b>124</b> are depressed (not shown), the aperture <b>128</b> is sufficiently widened to allow the fastening pin <b>112</b> to be readily extracted from the receptacle <b>114</b>. This design prevents inadvertent release of the fastening pin <b>112</b> (e.g., when a lug is bumped), but permits easy opening of the retainer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>when a health care provider seeks to move the catheter or other fitting held within the retainer <b>10</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0108"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–12</figref> illustrate an anchoring system <b>8</b> <i>c </i>in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Like the anchoring systems described above, the illustrated embodiment includes a retainer <b>10</b> <i>c</i>, a fitting or adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>and an anchor pad <b>16</b> <i>c</i>. The anchor pad <b>16</b> <i>c </i>desirably is similar to the anchor pad <b>16</b> described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The retainer <b>10</b> <i>c </i>and the fitting <b>11</b> <i>c </i>differ somewhat from the above-described embodiments, though certain features are the same. Accordingly, the above description applies equally to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–12</figref>, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, like reference numerals are used for like features among the embodiments, with the letter “c” added as a suffix to refer to features of the present embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0109">The illustrated posts <b>20</b> <i>c </i>do not include a locator ring of material below the head <b>26</b> <i>c</i>. The illustrated base <b>14</b> <i>c</i>, including dimensions of the posts <b>20</b> <i>c</i>, is otherwise identical to the base <b>14</b> described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>. Unlike the openings <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> <i>a </i>of the previous embodiments, the illustrated opening <b>32</b> <i>c </i>is shown without a lip or depression in the slot <b>36</b> <i>c</i>. It will be understood, however, that the slot can also include a depression over which the post head would seat without departing from the principles of the present embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">Like the previous embodiments, the present embodiment includes interengaging structure to mount the medical line to the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c</i>. In the illustrated embodiment, the interacting structure comprises a channel defined by a mounting structure <b>140</b>. The channel is sized and shaped to mount a medical line, such as a catheter, either directly or indirectly by way of a fitting. Desirably, the channel defined by the mounting structure <b>140</b> is configured to mate with and mount the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>which, in turn, engages with the medical line. In the illustrated embodiment, the mounting structure <b>140</b> is integrally formed with the cover <b>22</b> <i>c</i>, such as by injection molding. It will be understood, however, that the mounting structure <b>140</b> can equally well be formed as part of the base <b>14</b> <i>c </i>without materially affecting the function of the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0111">The illustrated mounting structure <b>140</b> comprises two substantially rectangular box-like extensions <b>141</b> that extends from the cover <b>22</b> <i>c </i>between the two openings <b>32</b> <i>c</i>. The extensions <b>141</b> are spaced by a distance sufficient to receive the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>and include inner faces <b>142</b> configured to mate with surfaces of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c</i>. The inner faces <b>142</b> are more particularly shaped to inhibit at least one degree of freedom, desirably to inhibit longitudinal movement of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>when the adaptor is mounted within the channel (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The illustrated inner faces <b>142</b> are convex in shape. The channel defined between the extensions <b>141</b>, thus, has a minimal width at a central point and widens toward either longitudinal end. In other arrangements, the skilled artisan will recognize that a maximum channel width at a central point will inhibit longitudinal movement of a different fitting. Where, as illustrated, the mounting structure <b>140</b> is integral with the cover <b>22</b> <i>c</i>, the extensions <b>141</b> desirably are spaced closely enough to provide a snug or slight interference fit for the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>within the channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0112">The mounting structure <b>140</b> (and the channel defined by it) has a height less than or equal to the height of the post shafts <b>25</b> <i>c </i>of the base <b>14</b> <i>c</i>. In the illustrated embodiment, the structure <b>140</b> is equal to the height of the shafts <b>25</b> <i>c</i>, less the thickness of the cover <b>22</b> <i>c</i>. An outer surface <b>144</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) of each of the illustrated extensions <b>141</b> is accordingly configured to mate with the platform <b>21</b> <i>c </i>of the base <b>14</b> <i>c</i>, and is flat in this case.</p>
  <p num="p-0113">The cover <b>22</b> <i>c </i>is illustrated with a slight hourglass shape, such as to provide a slight indentation <b>146</b> along an edge <b>148</b> of the cover <b>22</b> <i>c</i>. Desirably, the indentation <b>146</b> comprises transverse ridges <b>150</b>. This shape facilitates an interengagement between the fitting <b>11</b> <i>c </i>and the mounting structure <b>140</b> to inhibit movement of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>at least in the longitudinal direction, as described below.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">The fitting <b>11</b> <i>c </i>of the present embodiment is an in-line adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c</i>. This adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>comprises an elongate structure defining a fluid pathway, and means for connecting the adaptor to lines at either end. The illustrated adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>comprises a medical connector such as those commonly used to connect a supply line to a catheter.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">Desirably, the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>is of a type similar to that disclosed with respect to FIGS. 11 and 12 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,243 (“the '243 patent”), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>includes a male connector <b>160</b> for connection to a catheter and a female connector <b>162</b> for connection to a medical supply or delivery tube (e.g., leading to an IV drip or a suction pump). The illustrated male connector <b>160</b> includes a Luer-type fitting <b>164</b> with internal threads and a tapered nose extending outwardly, with an internal passageway for fluid communication with a catheter.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">The female connector <b>162</b> comprises external threads <b>166</b> and a membrane <b>168</b> for sealing the internal passageway. The membrane <b>168</b> can comprise a closed septum, through which a sharp needle is inserted to provide communication between the supply or delivery tube and the internal passageway. The membrane <b>168</b> can also comprise a pre-slit membrane, through which a blunt needle provides communication between the supply or delivery tube and the internal passageway. Desirably, however, the female connector <b>162</b> of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>comprises an internal needle integral with the internal passageway, as disclosed in the '243 patent. The membrane <b>168</b> comprises a resilient, self-sealing material which is outwardly biased.</p>
  <p num="p-0117">An adaptor body <b>170</b>, between the male connector <b>160</b> and the female connector <b>162</b>, comprises mounting surfaces <b>172</b> which form a portion of the interacting structure of the anchoring system <b>8</b> <i>c</i>. The illustrated mounting surfaces <b>172</b> comprise opposed concave surfaces, desirably including ridges (not shown) to facilitate finger gripping during connection of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>to catheters or other medical tubes. In this manner, the adaptor body <b>170</b> has a minimal width at a central point and widens toward both the female connector <b>162</b> and the male connector <b>160</b>. In particular, the widest points of the illustrated adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>are wider than the most narrow portion of the channel between the extensions <b>141</b> of the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0118">The mounting surfaces <b>172</b> are joined by a top surface <b>174</b> and a bottom surface (not shown). The top and bottom surfaces desirably are flat to mate with the illustrated cover <b>22</b> <i>c </i>and platform <b>21</b> <i>c </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c</i>, such that these surfaces also form a portion of the interacting structure.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">In operation, the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>can first be connected to medical tubes. For example, a catheter can be fitted with a female connector with external threading, similar to the female connector <b>162</b> of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c</i>. Such a connector can be quickly and easily threaded into the male connector <b>160</b> of the adaptor without any external needles, thus reducing the likelihood of needle sticks to the health care provider. While the female connector is threaded into the Luer-type fitting of the male connector <b>160</b>, the nose of the male connector <b>160</b> forces the membrane <b>168</b> backwards over the internal needle, thus providing fluid communication between the catheter and the internal passage of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c</i>. Similarly, a medical delivery/supply line can be fitted with a male connector similar to the male connector <b>160</b> of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c</i>. Such a connector would then connect with the female connector <b>162</b> of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c</i>, thereby completing fluid communication through the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>between the delivery/supply line and the catheter.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">The adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>then mounts within the channel defined by the mounting structure <b>140</b> of the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c</i>. In the illustrated embodiment, wherein the mounting structure <b>140</b> is formed integrally with the cover <b>22</b> <i>c</i>, the inner faces <b>142</b> of the extensions <b>141</b> desirably snugly receive and grip the mounting surfaces <b>172</b> of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0121">It will be understood by one of skill in the art, however, that the fit need not be tight enough to inhibit transverse movement of the fitting or adaptor, particularly where the mounting structure is integral to the base, rather than integral to the cover. Desirably, however, the interaction between the mounting structure inner faces <b>142</b> and the adaptor mounting surfaces <b>172</b> is such as to inhibit significant longitudinal movement (e.g., more than 1–2 mm) of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c</i>. In the illustrated embodiment, the minimal width of the channel is more narrow than the widest portions on either end of the adaptor body <b>170</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">With the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>thus mounted to the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c</i>, the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c </i>is then be closed and latched, as described with respect to the previous embodiments. Where, as illustrated, the mounting structure <b>140</b> is located on the cover <b>22</b> <i>c</i>, if the mounting structure <b>140</b> is not configured for firm engagement, the health care provider can hold the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>within the channel until the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c </i>is latched. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c </i>in a partially closed condition.</p>
  <p num="p-0123"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c </i>latched closed with the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>retained therein. As will be understood by one of skill in the art, the cover <b>22</b> <i>c </i>and the base <b>14</b> <i>c </i>interposed the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>between them, preventing transverse movement of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>relative to the retainer <b>14</b> <i>c</i>. The channel defined by the mounting structure <b>140</b> inhibits lateral or longitudinal movement of the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>relative to the retainer <b>14</b> <i>c </i>by the cooperating shape of the channel and the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>(which form the interengaging structure in this embodiment). Accordingly, the adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c </i>is sufficiently restrained to secure a catheter extending therefrom to the patient. If the catheter had not been secured to the adaptor prior to engagement of the adaptor to the retainer, the catheter can be secured after engagement.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">The skilled artisan will appreciate that the retainers disclosed herein demonstrate versatility in securing a great variety of medical articles to a patient. Retainers similar to those of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–9</figref> can be utilized to secure any device which is provided with holes spaced apart to engage with the posts. The cover is secured to the base to interpose the device between them. Many medical devices are already provided with suture holes which can be fitted over the retainer posts disclosed herein. Other devices can be modified to include such holes. Other arrangements to secure a medical article to the posts, either between the posts or adjacent to a single post, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the disclosure herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0125">Medical devices can be also be provided with surfaces similar to the mounting surfaces <b>172</b> of the illustrated adaptor <b>11</b> <i>c</i>, for mounting within the integral channel of the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–12</figref>. Y-joint adapters, for example, can be adapted to mount within the channel of the retainer <b>10</b> <i>c </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–12</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">Alternatively, one of skill in the art will readily appreciate that the disclosed retainers can be modified, without departing from the spirit of the invention, to mount and retain existing medical devices. For example, the integral mounting structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–12</figref> can be adapted to clamp existing Y-joint adapters, or to directly mount a catheter or other medical line without the need for an intermediate fitting. In addition, the channel can have a semi-tubular shape and include at least one lateral slot that receives a radially extending member of the adaptor (e.g., an annular collar). Desirably, any such modified mounting structure would inhibit longitudinal and lateral movement of the device or medical line. Transverse movement is inhibited by closure of the retainer with the device or line sandwiched between the base and the cover.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">Furthermore, the skilled artisan will recognize the interchangeability of various features from different embodiments. For example, the integral mounting structure <b>140</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–12</figref> can be adapted for mounting an adaptor in a retainer having the latch <b>70</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6–9</figref>, thus requiring no posts. Similarly, the various posts, slotted holes, hinges, anchor pads and fittings disclosed herein, as well as other known equivalents for each such feature, can be mixed and matched by one of ordinary skill in this art to construct anchoring systems in accordance with principles of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0128">Although not illustrated, each of the illustrated retainers can be adapted for use in an anchoring system which includes a safety loop. An anchor pad larger than the pad <b>16</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can mount both a retainer, in accordance with one of the preferred embodiments, and a separate tube clip. The medical line mounted by the retainer can also be secured less tightly to the tube clip, with an adequate amount of slack in the line between the retainer and the clip. The clip and the resultant slack are desirably located between the retainer and the catheter insertion site, for example.</p>
  <p num="p-0129">If movement by the patient causes a sudden pull upon catheter, the catheter slips within the tube clip and the slack length or “safety loop” of the tube is pulled through the clip. Friction between the clip and the sliding tube absorbs some of the force and some of the force causes a slight pull on the adhesive pad, functioning as a warning to the patient to cease the undesirable movement.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">Similarly, the retainer itself can be arranged to only slightly inhibit longitudinal movement of a catheter, such as to allow some amount of slip in response to large forces. For example, the fitting of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref> can comprise a soft wing clamp without the box clamp. In any of these arrangements, a jerk upon the medical line can be largely absorbed by allowing some slip, without either disconnecting the line from the fitting or painfully pulling the anchor pad from the patient's skin.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">Using a retainer in accordance with the above disclosure, no painful, invasive or time-consuming sutures or other extensive procedures involving medical sharps (e.g., suture needles) are necessary to anchor an elongate medical article to a patient's skin. In addition, the flexible anchor pad absorbs much of the force incurred in the installation or removal of the retainer and the medical device, thereby providing greater comfort for the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">As common to each of the above-described retainers and anchoring systems, the present invention provides a sterile, tight-gripping, needle-free way to anchor medical articles to a patient. The retainers thus eliminate accidental needle sticks, suture wound site infections and scarring because sutures are not required. In addition, the retainers can be used with any of a wide variety of catheters, tubes, wires, and other medical articles to provide universal securement using one style of retainer. Also, patient comfort is enhanced and application time is decreased with the use of the present retainer.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">The releasable engagement of the cover and the base allow the same retainer to be used more than once on the same patient at the application location. That is, a first medical device can be mounted in the retainer. When the function of the first medical device is accomplished, the retainer can be unlatched, the first device removed, and a second medical device can be retained in the same retainer. Furthermore, the leash or hinge connecting the cover to the base ensures that the cover will not be lost or misplaced during a catheter change. The health care provider wastes no time in searching for a cover, nor in orienting the cover prior to latching.</p>
  <p num="p-0134">Although this invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments and suggested possible modifications thereto, other embodiments and modifications apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art are also within the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is intended to be defined only by the claims which follow.</p>
