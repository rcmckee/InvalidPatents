<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED DISCLOSURE</heading> <p num="p-0002">This disclosure is a divisional application claiming the benefit of the filing date of pending U.S. patent application entitled: “Removable Toner Cartridge Universal Adapter,” by the same inventor, filed on Dec. 19, 2003, bearing Ser. No. 10/742,323.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">This invention relates, generally, to toner cartridges. More particularly, it relates to a toner cartridge that fits a large plurality of printers of differing brands and models.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Printer manufacturers such as IBM, Lexmark, and the like also make the toner cartridges that fit their respective printers.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Some printer cartridges, such as those manufactured by Hewlett Packard, employ a single component design. However, most companies make a toner cartridge that includes a waste bin containing waste toner and a hopper containing the toner supply. The hopper is connected to the trailing end of the waste bin. The leading end of the waste bin is inserted into the printer first when a toner cartridge is being installed. The user holds the trailing end of the waste bin when the toner cartridge is installed and removed.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Each printer manufacturer designs its printers to accept toner cartridges manufactured by it and to reject the toner cartridges manufactured by others.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">More particularly, to increase sales of their own toner cartridges, printer manufacturers have added structural features to the printers and to the toner cartridges that do not enhance the functional performance of the printer in any way but which serve to prevent use of a competitor's toner cartridge in the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Printer manufacturers also prefer to sell new toner cartridges to replace empty toner cartridges. Therefore, they do not support the re-cycling industry.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Thus there is a need for a universal adapter that enables a single toner cartridge to be used with printers made by differing manufacturers and with differing printers models made by a common manufacturer. Such a universal adapter could be re-filled with toner when empty by the re-cycling industry.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">The waste bin and hopper in conventional toner cartridges are pivotally interconnected to one another so that the hopper may move up and down in a vertical plane while the waste bin is secured into an immovable position. A full hopper has a weight sufficient to prevent it from pivotal movement, but as the hopper grows lighter as the toner therein is consumed, the hopper pivots upwardly under the influence of biasing means positioned at its opposite ends.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">The pivotal interconnection ensures that a proper nip is formed between the photoconductive drum of the waste bin and the developer roller of the hopper. Such pivotal mounting requires the use of springs to interconnect the waste bin to the hopper. It also requires use of a shipping lock strap during shipping to prevent the hopper from bouncing inside the printer or toner cartridge shipping box during transportation.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">There are several drawbacks to a pivotal interconnection of a waste bin and a hopper. The most obvious drawback is the need for an elongate spring at each end of the toner cartridge. A first end of each spring must be secured to the waste bin and a second end thereof must be secured to the hopper. This makes the assembly of the toner cartridge more difficult and increases the time required to complete the assembly. Moreover, during remanufacturing of the toner cartridge, additional handling of the spring can cause the loss of necessary spring tension causing improper nip between the developer roller and the photoconductive drum.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">Thus there is a need for an improved means for interconnecting a waste bin and a hopper. The improved interconnecting means should eliminate the pivotal mounting of the toner cartridge within the printer, eliminate the springs, and eliminate the need to use a shipping strap during transportation of the cartridge.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">If the toner hopper and waste bin are not pivotally connected to one another, a new construction is required for holding the hopper and waste bin together.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">The new construction must ensure that a proper nip is formed between the photoconductive drum that forms a part of the waste bin and the developer roller that forms a part of the hopper.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">To insert a toner cartridge into a printer, the leading end of the waste bin is introduced into a waste bin-receiving cavity formed in the printer. A laterally extending wing, usually called a planar wing, is formed integrally with each side wall of the waste bin and is slidingly received within guide grooves formed on opposite sides of the waste bin-receiving cavity formed in the printer body.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">The known planar wings are thin at their respective leading ends so that they can more easily enter into the guide grooves of the printer and thick at their respective trailing ends to provide more structural integrity. The leading ends are thus somewhat fragile and can be broken if a user does not exercise care when inserting a toner cartridge into a printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">Thus there is a need for an improved, more robust planar wing design having a uniform thickness along its extent so that the leading end thereof is no thinner than the trailing end thereof. The more robust planar shape also improves installation and removal of the toner cartridge into and out of the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">A conventional waste bin may include a small circuit board that, if present, must enter into electrical communication with electrical contacts on the printer to activate the printer. More particularly, one or more connection pads are mounted on the circuit board. Electrical contacts mounted on the printer at a preselected location, such as a printer door, communicate electrically with said circuit board through said connection pads.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">This invention also includes optical communication means that may replace any electrical communication means mentioned herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">Some waste bins have a small, substantially horizontally-disposed mounting pad on a left edge of a top wall thereof that supports the circuit board that is aligned to mate with (through the aforementioned connection pads) the electrical contacts secured to an associated printer. Other waste bins have a small mounting pad just to the right of the left edge-mounted pad to mate with the electrical contacts of other printers. Still other waste bins have a small, vertically disposed mounting pad on a front wall of the waste bin.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">Thus there is a need for a waste bin having both horizontally and vertically mounted pads that accommodate the circuit boards of all waste bins and which are positioned so that said circuit boards are properly positioned for electrical communication with the electrical contacts of the printer with which the waste bin is used. Such a waste bin does not appear in the prior art.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">Conventional printers further include a microswitch that enables the printer to operate when its cartridge door is fully closed. More particularly, when the cartridge door is fully closed, it engages a door-closed microswitch-actuating tab having a thin, upstanding construction. As a printer ages, its hinges and latches become worn to the extent that the cartridge door no longer engages the actuating tab even when the cartridge door is fully closed. The microswitch is therefore not closed and no “door closed” signal is sent to activate the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">Thus there is a need for an improved tab that is engaged by a closed cartridge door even when the hinges and latches of a printer door have become worn. More particularly, when the hinges and latches of a printer door have become worn, the needed tab would act to better position the closing of the door by centering on the microswitch port.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">Conventional toner cartridges are also difficult to insert into a printer. No dedicated gripping surface is provided so most users simply grasp the trailing end of the waste bin and hopper in a haphazard manner. The plastic on the trailing end of the waste bin has a lattice work or open mesh structure and a user is expected to place his or her fingers through various narrow slots provided by such lattice work when lifting and installing the toner cartridge. The fingers of many people cannot fit between the minimal clearance between the waste bin handle and hopper, thereby making the handling of the toner cartridge difficult. Since the cartridge has no dedicated handle, the user will most likely grasp the cartridge off center and the weight of the hopper and waste bin together will cause the toner cartridge to tilt relative to a horizontal plane as the user attempts to insert the toner cartridge into the printer. The toner cartridge often jams as a result.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">Thus, there is a need for a toner cartridge with a dedicated gripping means that centers a user's hands relative to the trailing end of the toner cartridge so that it can be placed into the printer while being held in a horizontal plane. Nor should an improved handle rely on narrow slots as part of the gripping means.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">Printers are also subject to jamming due to poorly designed media guides that are formed on the lower wall of the waste bin of a toner cartridge.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved waste bin having improved media guides that reduce the frequency of paper jams.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">Printers typically include downward forcing levers that bear against the toner cartridge after it has been inserted to keep the toner cartridge from rattling during printer operation. However, on the known cartridges, the levers bear against flat surfaces. Thus, if the toner cartridge is not installed properly, the levers bear against the cartridge and hold it in said improper position.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">There is therefore a need for an improved design that would ensure that the toner cartridge is in its optimal position relative to the printer when the downward forcing levers of the printer engage the toner cartridge.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">A toner cartridge is removed from a printer by manually lifting the trailing end of the toner cartridge relative to the stationary printer. However, in the known printer designs, very little clearance is provided for this lifting procedure, thereby increasing the degree of difficulty encountered when removing a toner cartridge. The small clearance also increases the difficulty associated with inserting a toner cartridge into a printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">Thus there is a need for a design that increases the clearance to facilitate the introduction and removal of a toner cartridge into and from a printer, respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">The known toner cartridges also have a door, known as the shutter or upper shutter, that is hingedly mounted to the top of the cartridge. The shutter pivots downwardly like a conventional door on a simple two pin hinge.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">Thus a need is extant for an improved shutter construction.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">However, in view of the prior art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art how the identified needs could be fulfilled.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0038">The long-standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for a toner cartridge that is adapted to engage a large number of printers made by different manufacturers and which also includes improvements that overcome the limitations of prior art toner cartridges is now met by a new, useful, and non-obvious invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">The novel toner cartridge is adapted to fit within a toner cartridge-receiving cavity of a printer. It includes a waste bin positioned at a leading end of the toner cartridge and a hopper connected to the waste bin at a trailing end of the waste bin.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">The waste bin and hopper are fixedly interconnected to one another and are held against movement relative to one another when fully installed within the toner cartridge-receiving cavity.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">The waste bin has a leading end sculpted to mate with the cartridge-receiving cavity of a plurality of printers. Therefore, the novel toner cartridge fits printers made by differing manufacturers and differing printer models made by a manufacturer.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">The leading end of the waste bin has a hollow structure defined by a leading wall, a pair of sidewalls, a top wall, a bottom wall, and an open trailing end in open communication with the hopper. The leading wall has a transverse extent less than a transverse extent of the open trailing end so that the leading end of the waste bin mates with a printer having a toner cartridge receiving cavity having a relatively wide opening that tapers down to a relatively narrow opening.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">A plurality of recesses is formed in the leading end of the waste bin to enable the leading end to mate with a plurality of printers. Some printers have no protrusions in their cartridge-receiving cavities, and others have one or more protrusions positioned at differing locations in said cavities. Significantly, each of the novel waste bins disclosed herein can mate with any printer. Thus it is appropriate to refer to the novel waste bin as a universal waste bin. Moreover, since a waste bin connected to a hopper forms a toner cartridge, it is appropriate to refer to the novel toner cartridge as a universal toner cartridge because it may be used with any printer among a plurality of printer families manufactured by differing companies that requires a removable toner cartridge.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">The recesses may be provided in any shape that accepts the protuberances formed in the toner cartridge-receiving cavity. For example, a “V”-shaped protuberance in a printer's cartridge-receiving cavity may be accepted or received within a “V”-shaped recess formed in the waste bin of the toner cartridge that is at least slightly larger than the protuberance. However, a square or rectangular recess could also accept a “V”-shaped protuberance. The advantage to having a recess that closely mates with a protuberance is that such a recess maximizes the amount of toner that may be stored in a waste bin. If a recess formed in the waste bin is larger than it needs to be, then the space for toner within the waste bin is compromised.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">In a first embodiment, the waste bin has a total of five recesses. Three equidistantly spaced apart recesses are formed in the leading end of the waste bin in laterally spaced relation to one another, and a recess is formed in each outboard corner of the waste bin. The three leading end recesses are hereinafter sometimes referred to as the first, second and third leading end recesses, and the two outboard recesses are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the first and second outboard recesses.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">Another way of describing the respective positions of the recesses of the first embodiment, as well as the recesses of additional embodiments, is to define the leading end of the waste bin as having a first half and a second half. Thus, the first leading end recess is described as being positioned in the middle of the first half, the second leading end recess is described as being positioned at the mid-point or middle of the leading end, and the third recess is described as being positioned at the middle of the second half of the leading end.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">In a second embodiment, the three leading edge recesses of the first embodiment are merged together to form a single elongate leading edge recess, and the two outboard recesses of the first embodiment are unchanged. Thus it can be said that the second embodiment includes first and second outboard recesses and an elongate leading end recess formed in the center of the leading end that has an extent sufficient to occupy almost all of the leading end.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">A third embodiment of the waste bin includes an elongate step formed in the waste bin along the entire extent thereof. This may be understood as a merging together of all five recesses of the first embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">A fourth embodiment merges together the first outboard recess and the first and second leading end recesses of the first embodiment. It further merges together the third leading end recess and the second outboard recess of the first embodiment. In other words, the fourth embodiment includes a first elongate recess that extends from a first outboard end of the leading end to a point about half-way along the extent of the first half of the leading end of the waste bin, and a second recess that extends from a second outboard end of the leading end to a point about half-way along the extent of the second half of the leading end of said waste bin.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">In a fifth embodiment, the third leading end recess of the first embodiment is merged with the second outboard recess of the first embodiment. The first outboard recess and the first and second leading end recesses of the first embodiment are unchanged. Thus, this embodiment may be described as having said first outboard recess, said first and second leading end recesses, and a fourth recess that extends from the second outboard end of the leading end to a point about mid-length of the second half of said leading end.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">A sixth embodiment merges together the first and second leading end recesses of the first embodiment. The first and second outboard recesses and the third leading end recess are unchanged from the first embodiment. This sixth embodiment therefore includes said first outboard recess, a second recess formed in said leading end that occupies almost all of the first half of the leading end from a mid-point of said leading end to a point near said first outboard recess, said third leading end recess, and said second outboard recess.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">A seventh embodiment merges together the second and third leading end recesses of the first embodiment. The first and second outboard recesses and the first leading end recess are unchanged from the first embodiment. The seventh embodiment therefore may be said to include said first outboard recess, said first leading end recess, a second leading end recess that occupies the second half of said leading end, extending from about the mid-point of said second half to a point near the second outboard recess, and said second outboard recess.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">An eighth embodiment merges together the first outboard recess and the first leading end recess of the first embodiment. The second and third leading end recesses and the second outboard recess are unchanged from the first embodiment. This embodiment thus includes a first recess that extends from a first outboard end of the leading end of the waste bin to a point about mid-length of the first half of said leading end, said second and third leading end recesses and the second outboard recess.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">A ninth embodiment merges together the first outboard recess and the first leading end recess of the first embodiment. It further merges together the second and third leading end recesses and the second outboard recess of the first embodiment. Thus this embodiment includes a first recess that extends from a first outboard end of the leading end of the waste bin to a point about mid-length of the first half of said leading end, and a second recess that extends from said second outboard end of said leading end to a point about mid-length of said leading end of said waste bin.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">A tenth embodiment merges together the first outboard recess and the first leading end recess of the first embodiment. It further merges together the third leading end recess and the second outboard recess of the first embodiment. The second leading end recess of the first embodiment is unchanged. It is therefore said that this tenth embodiment includes a first recess that extends from a first outboard end of the leading end of the waste bin to a point near said second leading end recess, said second leading end recess, and a third recess extending from said second end of said leading end to a point near said second leading end recess.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">These ten (10) embodiments are illustrative of the invention and are not exhaustive thereof. As printer manufacturers add additional or different protuberances, still further recesses may be required in future embodiments of the invention but all such future embodiments are within the scope of this invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">Moreover, as mentioned earlier, each embodiment of the ten (10) illustrative embodiments will fit into any printer cavity of certain brands and models, regardless of the number and placement of protrusions therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">For example, the Optra® S printer has no protrusions in its cartridge-receiving cavity. Thus, none of the recesses formed in any of the ten embodiments are needed when the universal toner cartridge is inserted into the printer cavity of such printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">The Optra® T printer, however, has one outboard protrusion.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">Printers in the 520 family of printers include a center protrusion that mates with the second leading edge recess but such printer family includes no outboard protrusions.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Printers in the 620 printer family have no protrusions that mate with the three leading edge recesses, but they have two outboard protrusions.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">Printers in the 630 printer family have one protrusion that mates with the first leading edge protrusion and no outboard protrusions.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">Printers in the 632 and 634 sub-families have one protrusion that mates with the third leading edge recess and no outboard protrusions.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">Thus, the various combination of leading end recesses and outboard recesses will work with all currently known printer families and sub-families and in view of this disclosure any future changes in printer-receiving cavity designs can be met.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">In addition to the aforesaid embodiments of the sculpted leading end of the waste bin, the waste bin includes multiple additional improvements as well, none of which depend upon the sculpted leading end thereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">A first improvement unrelated to the sculpted leading end of the waste bin is a first circuit board mounting pad formed in a substantially horizontal top wall of the waste bin. The mounting pad accommodates a user-operated selector switch that indicates a printer brand with which the novel universal toner cartridge is to be used. The first circuit board mounting pad has a size sufficient to hold a large circuit board with large electrical contacts that mates with printer-mounted contacts that may be in a first, left position or a second, right position. Thus it is understood that the circuit board is also a universal circuit board because it has a size sufficient to enter into electrical communication with printers having left-mounted contacts or right-mounted contacts.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">A second improvement unrelated to the sculpted leading end includes a second circuit board mounting pad positioned on a vertical wall of the waste bin. The second circuit board mounting pad is smaller than the first circuit board mounting pad and is adapted to mate with a third group of printers that include relatively small circuit boards that mate with mounting pads positioned near the front left edge of the waste bin. However, the second circuit board mounting pad is also designed to accommodate a larger circuit board that supports larger components or a greater number of components. Thus, the second circuit board mounting pad is also universal in operation because it can receive small and large circuit boards.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">Another improvement enhances the ergonomics of a toner cartridge. A thumb grip, dished to accept a thumb, is formed in the trailing end of the waste bin, centrally thereof, An arch extends transversely across the trailing end of the waste bin and rises to a height sufficient to accommodate a user's fingers when the user's thumb is positioned in the thumb grip.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">A toner cartridge is further improved by enhancing the media guides formed in a bottom wall of the waste bin. Specifically, rounded surfaces are formed in each of the media guides to reduce friction as paper is dragged over them.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">A hopper torque tab receptacle, having a relatively larger opening and rounded edges, is formed in the waste bin and is adapted to vertically receive a tab formed in the hopper when the waste bin is connected to the hopper. In this way, the hopper is keyed to the waste bin, preventing lateral movement between the hopper and waste bin when a driving force is applied to the hopper.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">An improved microswitch actuating tab is formed in upstanding relation to a top wall of the waste bin. It is adapted to actuate a microswitch that is adapted to activate the printer when a printer door is fully closed. The microswitch-actuating tab has a height sufficient to actuate the microswitch even when the door of the printer has worn latches or hinges and therefore does not fully close. A first embodiment of the novel microswitch has a uniform thickness and is taller than a conventional actuating tab. It therefore provides a more positive engagement of the microswitch. A second embodiment is somewhat diamond-shaped, being thicker at mid-height than at its top and bottom. Both embodiments are structurally stronger than prior art microswitch actuating tabs and have greater height so that they remain effective even when the hinges and latches of the printer door are worn, loose, or on otherwise poor condition.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">The printer therefore receives an activating signal when the door of the printer is closed even if the printer has worn latches and hinges.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The first embodiment of the microswitch-actuating tab has a uniform thickness and taller protrusion that provides for a more positive engagement of the micro switch.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">The second embodiment of the microswitch-actuating tab has a top section, a mid-section, and a bottom section. The top section widens from top to bottom, the bottom section narrows from top to bottom, and the mid-section is wider than the top section and the bottom section.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">The narrow top edge of the microswitch actuating tab facilitates its entry into a narrow opening formed in the bottom edge of the printer door and the widened middle section helps the microswitch actuating tab to positively engage the narrow opening. This structure therefore is operative to center a printer door having worn hinges.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">Yet another improvement relates to a planar wing that is formed in each sidewall of the waste bin. Each planar wing is adapted to slidingly engage an associated guide groove formed in opposite sides of the printer. Advantageously, each planar wing has a uniform thickness along its extent, thereby providing structural integrity and preventing the planar wing from flexing when the waste bin is being installed into the printer. The reduction in rearward sloping angle of the planar wing allows for easier installation and removal of the cartridge from the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">A second embodiment of the planar wing includes three supporting wheels in lieu of a continuous plane. These wheels provide support at key positions to allow for support during installation, engagement and removal of the cartridge from the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">A concave depression adapted to receive downward forcing levers that form a part of the printer is formed in a top edge of each sidewall. The concave depression is effective to center downwardly directed force provided by the downward forcing levers.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">A recess is also formed in a top edge of each waste bin sidewall to provide clearance for the waste bin when it is pivoted upwardly relative to the printer during removal.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">A hopper pin-mounting hole is formed in each waste bin sidewall and is adapted to receive a mounting pin formed in the hopper with zero vertical clearance. Accordingly, the hopper does not move relative to the waste bin when the hopper and waste bin are interconnected to one another. Moreover, no shipping strap is required when the hopper and waste bin are transported as a unit in interconnected relation to one another.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">A latching means for interconnecting the waste bin and the hopper to one another in a non-pivotal interconnection includes a hopper wheel horizontal retainer and a hopper wheel vertical lock formed integrally with the waste bin. The hopper wheel horizontal retainer and the hopper wheel vertical lock are disposed in cooperative relation to one another and are adapted to engage a hopper wheel that forms a part of the hopper. To assemble the toner cartridge, the waste bin is held above the hopper so that the hopper wheel horizontal retainer and the hopper wheel vertical lock are positioned directly above the hopper wheel. The waste bin is lowered until the hopper wheel horizontal retainer engages the hopper wheel and the hopper wheel vertical lock.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">The hopper wheel horizontal retainer has an upwardly inclined surface, a concavity, and a hump between the upwardly inclined surface and the concavity. The hopper wheel engages the upwardly inclined surface and causes the hopper wheel horizontal retainer to momentarily deflect from its position of repose when the waste bin is lowered with respect to the hopper. The hopper wheel rolls over the hump and the resiliency of the hopper wheel horizontal retainer causes the hopper wheel horizontal retainer to return to its position of repose, thereby capturing the hopper wheel in the concavity. The hopper wheel simultaneously causes the hopper wheel vertical lock to deflect away from its position of repose as well. The hopper wheel vertical lock has a straight construction and a hook formed at a free leading end thereof. The vertical lock returns to its position of repose, thereby capturing a bottom of the hopper wheel when the hopper wheel clears the hook. Accordingly, the hopper wheel is captured on a trailing side thereof by the concavity and on its bottom side by said hook.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">The invention also includes an embodiment having the hopper wheel horizontal retainer but no hopper wheel vertical lock.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">In another embodiment, the hopper wheel vertical lock is formed in depending relation to a preselected sidewall of the waste bin. A guide rail is integrally formed with a preselected sidewall of the waste bin. The hopper wheel rollingly engages the guide rail as the waste bin is lowered into interconnecting relation to the hopper. The hopper wheel rolls along the guide rail until the hook captures it.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">An aperture adapted to receive a mounting pin from the hopper is formed in each sidewall of the waste bin near a trailing end thereof. A taper is formed in the aperture so that the aperture is smaller on the outside surface of the sidewall than on an inside surface thereof. When the waste bin is lowered onto the hopper to interconnect the waste bin and hopper together, the hopper mounting pin enters into the tapered aperture. The taper urges the hopper into abutting relation to the waste bin and eliminates play from the aperture and therefore eliminates any need for springs to urge the hopper into abutting relation with the waste bin.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">In a further embodiment, the hopper wheel has an axle. A retainer is formed by a raised wall formed in a preselected sidewall of the waste bin that captures and guides the hopper wheel axle when the waste bin is lowered into interconnecting relation to the hopper. A lowermost end of the retainer has a forwardly extending bend formed therein so that as the taper urges the hopper into abutting relation to the waste bin, the hopper wheel axle is pushed into the forward bend. A nip formed by contact between the photoconductive drum of the waste bin and the developer roller of the hopper is thereby maintained.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">In another embodiment, a straight, horizontally disposed slot is formed in the waste bin sidewalls on both the driving and the driven sides thereof. The hopper wheel axles are aligned with the slots and are slidingly introduced thereinto to join the waste bin and hopper to one another. The hopper mounting pins are inserted into the tapered aperture so that the respective tapered walls shove the hopper forward until the hopper wheel axles are fully pressed into said forward ends of the slots. This structure eliminates the hopper wheel horizontal retainer and the hopper wheel vertical lock. This structure also maintains a nip formed by contact between the photoconductive drum of the waste bin and the developer roller of the hopper.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">To prevent piggybacking of an unauthorized circuit board over an authorized circuit board, a flat mounting surface adapted to receive a first circuit board is formed in a vertical wall of the waste bin, an upper arcuate member extends from a point just above the flat mounting surface to a lower surface of the planar wing and a lower arcuate member extends from a point just below the flat mounting surface to a preselected point at a still further lower elevation, The upper and lower arcuate blocking members obstruct the placing of an unauthorized circuit board over an authorized circuit board.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">To improve the he construction of the upper shutter door, a slot is added to the inner and upper sidewall of the driven side of the waste bin. The shutter is made in the form of a bi-fold door and the two halves are hinged to one another by a hinge that extends into the slot and is therefore constrained to travel along the length of the slot. The driving side of the shutter travels freely.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">More particularly, a substantially horizontal slot is formed in an interior sidewall of the toner cartridge on a driven side of the toner cartridge. The substantially horizontal slot is adapted to slidingly receive a hinge pin of a shutter door. In a first embodiment of the shutter assembly, the shutter has a bi-fold door construction. In a second embodiment, the shutter door assembly has an accordion construction. In further embodiments, it has a tri-fold construction, a sliding pocket door construction that is telescopically received within a pocket when retracted, and in a final illustrative embodiment, the shutter is flexible and is coiled about a reel when retracted and uncoiled from the reel when extended.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">An important object of this invention is to provide a toner cartridge that can be used with substantially any commercially available printer of certain families.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">Another important object is to provide a waste bin and hopper construction that positively engage one another in the absence of a pivotal connection.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">Additional objects include the provision of a toner cartridge having improved planar wings, a plurality of circuit board mounts, an improved “door open” microswitch depressor, a dedicated gripping surface, enhanced media guides, an improved interface with the downward forcing levers of the printer, and improved clearance.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">These and other important objects, advantages, and features of the invention will become clear as this description proceeds.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements, and arrangement of parts that will be exemplified in the description set forth hereinafter and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.</p>

Accordingly, wide circuit board <b>110</b> <i>a </i>mates with a first group of printers that include contact pins that engage contacts <b>111</b> <i>a </i>and <b>113</b> <i>a </i>positioned on wide circuit board <b>110</b> <i>a </i>in position “<b>30</b>L” and it also mates with a second group of printers that include contact pins that engage contacts <b>111</b> <i>a </i>and <b>113</b> <i>a </i>positioned on wide circuit board <b>110</b> <i>a </i>in position “<b>30</b>R.”</p>
  <p num="p-0188">Large circuit board mounting pad <b>30</b> also has sufficient size to accommodate a printer selector switch <b>120</b> or <b>120</b> <i>a</i>, disclosed hereinafter in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A–C</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0189">Second circuit board mounting port <b>32</b> is smaller than first circuit board mounting pad <b>30</b>. It mates with a third group of printers that include relatively small circuit boards that mate with mounting pads positioned near the front left edge of cleaner chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0190">Older printer models such as Optra Se and Optra T have contact pins that mate with a circuit board positioned on mounting pad <b>30</b> and newer printer models such as Optra T520, Optra T522, Optra T620, Optra T622, and Optra T63X, have contact pins that mate with a circuit board mounted in circuit board port <b>32</b>. The Optra S models do not include a circuit board.</p>
  <p num="p-0191">Still further novel features are perhaps best depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A–F</figref>. Thumb grip <b>34</b> is formed in trailing end <b>11</b> of waste bin <b>12</b>, centrally thereof. It is dished to comfortably accept a thumb and a user will recognize that said thumb grip <b>34</b> is dedicated to receiving the user's thumb. The cartridge is installed and removed without binding when a user's hand is centered thereon due to placement of the user's thumb in said thumb grip <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0192">Moreover, as best indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, arch <b>36</b> extends transversely across trailing end <b>11</b>, rising to a height sufficient to accommodate a user's fingers when the user's thumb is positioned in thumb grip <b>34</b>. This structure ensures that toner cartridge <b>10</b> is held level when it is inserted into the printer. It also eliminates the narrow finger-receiving slots of the prior art.</p>
  <p num="p-0193">A plurality of novel media guides, collectively denoted <b>38</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3C</figref>, are formed in a bottom wall of cleaner chamber <b>12</b>. Media guides <b>38</b> are shown in enlarged configuration in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. They have rounded surfaces as best understood in connection with said <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> to reduce the friction as paper is dragged over them. The reduced friction substantially eliminates the jamming problem caused by the high friction media guides of the prior art.</p>
  <p num="p-0194"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> depicts hopper torque tab receptacle <b>40</b> which is formed in cleaner chamber <b>12</b>. When cleaner chamber <b>12</b> is lowered vertically to engage hopper <b>14</b>, hopper torque tab <b>43</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), is received within receptacle <b>40</b>. This keys hopper <b>14</b> to waste bin <b>12</b>, preventing lateral movement between said two parts when a driving force is applied to the hopper. More particularly, single-headed directional arrow <b>42</b> indicates the lateral direction hopper <b>14</b> is displaced when said hopper <b>14</b> is driven. Note that the plastic to the right of receptacle <b>40</b>, denoted <b>41</b> as a whole, provides reinforcement where it is most needed, i.e., in the direction of said arrow <b>42</b>. As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a radius <b>40</b> <i>a </i>is formed in waste bin <b>12</b> at the periphery of receptacle <b>40</b> to help canter and guide torque tab <b>43</b> into said receptacle <b>40</b>. Moreover, receptacle <b>40</b> is wider than heretofore known to further facilitate vertical entry of torque tab <b>43</b> into said torque tab receptacle <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0195">As perhaps best understood in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E and 3F</figref>, a second embodiment of microswitch actuating tab <b>19</b> is denoted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E and 3F</figref> by the reference numeral <b>44</b> as a whole. Microswitch actuating tab <b>44</b> has a construction that extends to a higher elevation than the microswitch actuating tabs of the prior art. Moreover, top section <b>44</b> <i>a </i>thereof widens from top to bottom and bottom section <b>44</b> <i>b </i>narrows from top to bottom. Thus, mid-section <b>44</b> <i>c </i>is the widest part of said tab <b>44</b>. A “door closed” signal is generated and sent to activate the printer even if the printer has worn hinges and latches, due to the increased height of tab <b>44</b>. The narrow top edge of tab <b>44</b> facilitates its entry into a narrow opening formed in the bottom edge of the printer door, not shown, and widened middle section <b>44</b> <i>c </i>helps it positively engage said narrow opening while centering the printer door. The novel structure also provides additional protection against breakage of said tab <b>44</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0196">A thicker and taller embodiment of microswitch actuating tab <b>44</b> is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and denoted by the reference numeral <b>19</b>. Its increased height allows for even more wear in the hinges and latches and its increased thickness provides enhanced durability and structural strength to center the door.</p>
  <p num="p-0197">A number of additional novel features are depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> which provides an elevational view of the drive side of novel waste bin <b>12</b>. Beginning at the left side of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, it will first be observed that planar wing <b>50</b> is shorter than a conventional planar wing by about one-quarter inch as indicated as at <b>51</b>. This shortening is required because planar wing <b>50</b> is thicker than a conventional planar wing at said leading end. Unlike conventional planar wings, planar wing <b>50</b> has a uniform thickness along its extent. This structure increases the strength of planar wing <b>50</b> and eliminates flexing that causes binding and cocking of the toner cartridge during its installation into a printer. The uniform thickness also makes the novel planar wing less prone to cracking and breaking than the planar wings heretofore known.</p>
  <p num="p-0198">The trailing end <b>53</b> of planar wing is bifurcated into upper section <b>53</b> <i>a </i>and lower section <b>53</b> <i>b</i>. Said parts cooperate with one another to form a latch member having a function disclosed in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A–F</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0199">Concave depression <b>52</b> helps to lock waste bin <b>12</b> into its functional position in the printer. Specifically, concave depression <b>52</b> extends from about point <b>52</b> <i>a </i>to about point <b>52</b> <i>b </i>and receives downward forcing levers that form a part of the printer. Concavity <b>52</b> thus helps to center the force provided by said downward forcing levers.</p>
  <p num="p-0200">Wall <b>54</b> has a lower elevation than its prior art counterpart to provide additional clearance for waste bin <b>12</b> when it is pivoted upwardly relative to the printer during removal. This makes the novel toner cartridge easier to remove.</p>
  <p num="p-0201">Vent <b>56</b> enhances cooling air flow to the photoconductor drum, not shown.</p>
  <p num="p-0202">A plurality of strengthening ribs, collectively denoted <b>58</b>, improve the structural integrity of waste bin <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0203">Hopper pin mounting aperture <b>60</b> receives a mounting pin <b>62</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1C</figref>) mounted to hopper <b>14</b> with zero vertical clearance. Upper spacer <b>61</b> <i>a </i>and lower spacer <b>61</b> <i>b </i>reduce the vertical clearance of said mounting aperture <b>60</b>. The hopper pin mounting aperture of the prior art provides vertical clearance because prior art hoppers are pivotally mounted to their associated waste bins. By eliminating the pivotal interconnection between waste bin <b>12</b> and hopper <b>14</b>, various springs are eliminated. Moreover, the zero clearance locks novel hopper <b>14</b> into position relative to novel waste bin <b>12</b> so no shipping strap is required when novel toner cartridge <b>10</b> is shipped.</p>
  <p num="p-0204"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a side elevational view of the driven side of the toner cartridge. It therefore shows much of the same structure, as indicated by the common reference numerals. One difference is the three photoconductive drum cooling vent holes, collectively denoted <b>56</b>, instead of the single vent hole formed in the drive side of waste bin <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0205">Another difference is that a structure for preventing problematic “piggy backing” of circuit boards onto a host circuit board may be seen in said <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, said structure not being present on the drive side of waste bin <b>12</b>. This novel structure is denoted <b>101</b>, generally, and is disclosed more fully in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A–C</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0206"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C–E</figref> depict the shipping lock strap mentioned above. Shipping lock strap <b>11</b> <i>a </i>includes brackets <b>11</b> <i>b </i>and <b>11</b> <i>c </i>formed integrally at its opposite ends. Such brackets are secured to opposite ends of a prior art hopper <b>14</b> because the hopper pins of such prior art hopper is free to move about inside its mating aperture. Hence the need for hold-down strap <b>11</b> <i>a </i>in prior art hopper <b>14</b>, such need being eliminated by the absence of vertical clearance between said pin and aperture in the novel structure as aforesaid.</p>
  <p num="p-0207">A first embodiment of the novel latching means for interconnecting waste bin <b>12</b> and hopper <b>14</b> to one another in a non-pivotal interconnection appears to some extent in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A–B</figref> but is best illustrated in FIGS. <b>5</b>A–B and <b>6</b>A–B.</p>
  <p num="p-0208">Hopper wheel horizontal retainer <b>70</b> and hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b> are formed integrally with waste bin <b>12</b> and cooperate with one another to engage hopper wheel <b>64</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1C</figref>) that is snapped onto hopper axle <b>65</b> near its leading end as best understood in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0209">When hopper wheel <b>64</b> is engaged in horizontal retainer <b>70</b> and hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b>, its captured position dictates the elevation of the rear of planar wing <b>53</b> <i>c </i>as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 4A</figref>. Horizontal retainer <b>70</b> exerts an upward force on hopper wheel <b>64</b>, causing it to make snug contact at a point on the bottom side of level planar wing <b>53</b> <i>c</i>. Such snug contact ensures proper alignment and orientation of cartridge components when the cartridge is installed into and removed from the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0210">The leveling of the planar wing provides for a smoother glide over printer guides during installation of the cartridge into and removal of the cartridge from the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0211">To assemble novel toner cartridge <b>10</b>, waste bin <b>12</b> is held above hopper <b>14</b> as mentioned earlier in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A–C</figref> so that hopper wheel horizontal retainer <b>70</b> and hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b> are positioned directly above hopper wheel <b>64</b>. As waste bin <b>12</b> is lowered, hopper wheel <b>64</b> engages upwardly inclined surface <b>70</b> <i>a </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A–B</figref>) of horizontal retainer <b>70</b> and causes horizontal retainer <b>70</b> to deflect from its <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A–B</figref> position of repose. Hopper wheel <b>64</b> rolls over hump <b>70</b> <i>b </i>and the resiliency of horizontal retainer <b>70</b> causes it to move back toward its position of repose, thereby capturing hopper wheel <b>64</b> in concavity <b>70</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0212">When hopper wheel <b>64</b> is causing horizontal retainer <b>70</b> to deflect away from its position of repose as aforesaid, said hopper wheel simultaneously causes hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b> to deflect away from its <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A–B</figref> position of repose as well. When hopper wheel <b>64</b> clears hook <b>72</b> <i>a </i>at the free end of vertical lock <b>72</b>, said vertical lock moves back toward its position of repose, thereby capturing the bottom of hopper wheel <b>64</b>. In this way, hopper wheel <b>64</b> is captured on a trailing side thereof by concavity <b>70</b> <i>c </i>and on its bottom side by flat wall <b>72</b> <i>b </i>of hook <b>72</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0213">The deflection of hopper wheel <b>64</b> toward cleaner chamber <b>12</b> is limited by contact of the developer roller (not shown) in the hopper and the photoconductor drum, not shown, in the removable toner cartridge universal adapter.</p>
  <p num="p-0214"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates hopper wheel horizontal retainer <b>70</b> and hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b> from a forward perspective relative to the rear perspective of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. It should be understood that both <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are taken from inside waste bin <b>12</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows more clearly that said parts <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are separate parts.</p>
  <p num="p-0215">It is also best understood from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> that neither part <b>70</b> or <b>72</b> is laterally supported by a wall; note opening <b>71</b> formed in sidewall <b>73</b> of waste bin <b>12</b>. It is this lack or lateral support that requires the engagement of hopper torque tab <b>43</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) and hopper torque tab receptacle <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0216"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> depicts an improved hopper wheel horizontal retainer <b>70</b>. Arcuate part <b>70</b> <i>c </i>has a greater circumferential extent in this embodiment and thus more fully captures hopper wheel <b>64</b>, thereby eliminating the need for hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0217">Note in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> how the bottom of hopper wheel <b>64</b> is supported by flat surface <b>64</b> <i>a </i>of hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0218"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> depict hopper wheel horizontal retainer <b>70</b> and hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b> that are positioned on the driven side of waste bin <b>12</b>. They perform the same function as their drive side counterparts and engage and capture the hopper wheel associated with the non-drive side of waste bin <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0219"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> depict an alternative structure for interlocking waste bin <b>12</b> and hopper <b>14</b>. Both Figures are taken from the inside of said waste bin. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> depicts the structure of the driving side and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> depicts the structure of the driven side.</p>
  <p num="p-0220">This alternative structure eliminates hopper wheel horizontal retainer <b>70</b> but it does not eliminate hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b>. Guide rail <b>74</b> is integrally formed with a sidewall of the driving side of waste bin <b>12</b>. As waste bin <b>12</b> is lowered toward hopper <b>14</b>, hopper wheel <b>64</b> rollingly engages guide rail <b>74</b> and said hopper wheel continues to roll down said guide rail until it is captured by hook <b>72</b> <i>a </i>of vertical lock <b>72</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0221">In this embodiment, vertical lock <b>72</b> is supported from behind by a waste bin sidewall. Accordingly, hopper torque tab <b>43</b> is eliminated as is hopper torque tab receptacle <b>40</b>. Hopper torque tab <b>43</b> must be cut off from the hopper before the hopper is inserted into the novel removable toner cartridge universal adapter.</p>
  <p num="p-0222">Essentially the same structure is provided on the driven side of waste bin <b>12</b>, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0223"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A–C</figref> depicts yet another important feature of novel waste bin <b>12</b>. A thirty degree (30°) taper is formed in aperture <b>80</b> formed in a trailing end of a side wall of waste bin <b>12</b>, said aperture being formed in both the driving and driven sides thereof as depicted in said <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. As perhaps best understood in connection with the top plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, trailing wall <b>80</b> <i>a </i>of aperture <b>80</b> is angled at a thirty degree (30°) angle so that aperture <b>80</b> is smaller on the outside surface of the sidewall than it is on the inside surface thereof. When the trailing end of waste bin <b>12</b> is lowered onto hopper <b>14</b> to interconnect said waste bin and hopper together, the flexible and resilient trailing ends of the waste bin sidewalls are slightly diverged from one another so that pins <b>62</b> that extend from opposite ends of hopper <b>14</b> may enter into the tapered aperture <b>80</b> formed in each of said side walls. As mentioned above, springs are used in prior art toner cartridges to urge the hopper forwardly toward cleaner chamber <b>12</b> so that the photoconductive drum of the waste bin will properly contact the developer roller of the hopper.</p>
  <p num="p-0224">The untapered prior art aperture thus provides a mounting means for loosely securing the hopper to the waste bin, but such prior art untapered aperture performs no role in biasing the hopper toward the cleaner chamber.</p>
  <p num="p-0225">Thus it is understood that the taper of trailing wall <b>80</b> <i>a </i>urges hopper <b>14</b> forwardly, i.e., toward cleaner chamber <b>12</b>. This eliminates the need for the prior art springs that perform such function.</p>
  <p num="p-0226">Both hopper wheel horizontal retainer <b>70</b> and hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b> are eliminated in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> which depict the driving and driven sides of waste bin <b>12</b>, respectively. Hopper wheel axle retainer <b>90</b> is formed on the inside surface of the driving and driven side walls of waste bin <b>12</b> and is adapted to slidingly receive axle <b>65</b> that extends from the hopper of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> modified so that hopper wheel <b>64</b> is removed. More particularly, a raised wall forms retainer <b>90</b> that captures and guides said hopper wheel axle. The lowermost end of each retainer <b>90</b> has a forwardly extending bend <b>90</b> <i>a </i>formed therein so that as trailing wall <b>80</b> <i>a </i>urges hopper <b>14</b> in said forward direction, i.e., toward the leading end of waste bin <b>12</b> and thus toward the printer, said hopper wheel axle is pushed into said forward bend <b>90</b> <i>a</i>. This maintains the nip formed by the contact between the photoconductive drum of waste bin <b>12</b> and the developer roller of hopper <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0227">Note further that hopper wheel axle retainer <b>90</b> formed in the inner surface of the waste bin side wall at the driving side of the waste bin is supported by said side wall and thus there is no need for torque tab <b>43</b> to be formed in hopper <b>14</b> and thus there is no need for hopper torque tab receptacle <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0228">Perhaps the best harnessing of the forward bias supplied by tapered wall <b>80</b> <i>a </i>is disclosed in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. In this embodiment, both hopper wheel horizontal retainer <b>70</b> and hopper wheel vertical lock <b>72</b> are again eliminated, as is hopper wheel axle retainer <b>90</b>. In this alternative embodiment, the hopper wheel axle retainer is not a raised wall as in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> but is a straight, horizontally disposed slot <b>92</b> formed in the waste bin side walls on both the driving and the driven sides of waste bin <b>12</b>. Hopper wheel axles <b>65</b> with wheel <b>64</b> removed are aligned with slots <b>92</b> and slidingly introduced thereinto. Hopper mounting pins <b>62</b> and <b>62</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A–C</figref>) on opposite ends of hopper <b>14</b> are then inserted into their respective apertures <b>80</b> and <b>80</b>. The respective tapered walls <b>80</b> <i>a </i>and <b>80</b> <i>a </i>shove hopper <b>14</b> forward until the developer roller in the hopper contacts the photoconductive drum in the removable toner cartridge universal adapter.</p>
  <p num="p-0229">As in the preceding embodiment, there is no need for torque tab <b>43</b> formed in hopper <b>14</b> and thus there is no need for hopper torque tab receptacle <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0230"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> provides an enlarged view of the novel structure <b>101</b> that prevents “piggy backing” of a problematic circuit board over a vertically-mounted host circuit board. There is no “piggy backing” problem associated with horizontally-mounted circuit boards. Flat mounting surface <b>100</b> is recessed with respect to raised flat mounting surface <b>112</b> and said mounting surface <b>100</b> is therefore adapted to receive thereon a circuit board that is smaller than a circuit board supported by raised surface <b>112</b>. Whether small or large, the circuit board is electrically contacted by spring-loaded contacts in the printer. When a “piggy back” circuit board is placed over the host circuit board, the spring-loaded contacts in the printer urge the contacts onto the “piggy back” circuit board with a force that can damage the spring-loaded contacts by over-compressing the contacts in the printer beyond their normal limits due to the double thickness of the two circuit boards.</p>
  <p num="p-0231">A pair of arcuate blocking members is therefore provided. Upper arcuate member <b>102</b> extends from a point just above raised mounting surface <b>112</b> to a lower surface of planar wing <b>50</b>. Lower arcuate member <b>104</b> extends from a point just below said raised mounting surface <b>112</b> to a preselected point at a still further lower elevation. Both arcuate members are preferably formed of a high impact plastic. Unauthorized circuit boards are substantially larger than the authorized board, so the presence of arcuate blocking members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> obstructs the placing of a “piggy back” circuit board over the host circuit board.</p>
  <p num="p-0232">Wall <b>103</b> to which arcuate members <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are mounted is called a skeg wall in the industry. More particularly, it is called the driven side skeg wall because it is positioned on the driven side of toner cartridge <b>10</b>. Directional arrows <b>103</b> <i>a </i>at the lower right corner of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> indicate that the lower edge of skeg wall <b>103</b> has been cut so that it is flat. Specifically, about four millimeters (4 mm) have been shaved from the bottom edge of a skeg wall of the prior art. This enables the mated hopper and waste bin to sit in a stable position, i.e., without wobbling, on a flat surface external to a printer, i.e., when said mated waste bin and hopper are not positioned in a printer-receiving cavity. The skeg wall of prior art toner cartridges introduces instability and said prior art toner cartridges therefore wobble when placed on a flat surface external to a printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0233">Plastic brace <b>106</b> is bent downwardly in an arc as shown to provide additional support to upper arcuate member <b>102</b> so that said arcuate member <b>102</b> cannot be displaced rearwardly to make room for a “piggy back” circuit board.</p>
  <p num="p-0234"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is a perspective view of recessed surface <b>100</b> and raised surface <b>112</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> provides an enlarged view of embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. Recess <b>100</b> is adapted to receive a small circuit board, not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> <i>c</i>, and raised surface <b>112</b> receives a larger circuit board, not shown in this figure.</p>
  <p num="p-0235"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a rear perspective view of waste bin <b>12</b>. Downward forcing wheel <b>55</b> <i>a </i>that forms a part of downward forcing lever assembly <b>55</b> is depicted in rolling engagement with concavity <b>52</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0236"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A–F</figref> provide an animation depicting the insertion of a planar wing <b>50</b> into receiving cavity <b>57</b> of a printer. The trailing end <b>53</b> of planar wing <b>50</b> is bifurcated into upper section <b>53</b> <i>a </i>and lower section <b>53</b> <i>b </i>and performs a latch function when lower section <b>53</b> <i>b </i>is fully received within catch cavity <b>57</b> <i>a </i>at the trailing end of receiving cavity <b>57</b>. The small size of lower section <b>53</b> <i>b </i>reduces its contact area with receiving cavity <b>57</b>, thereby making it easy to insert and remove toner cartridge <b>10</b> into and from the printer, respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0237"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a perspective view depicting an embodiment of planar wing <b>50</b> where said planar wing is discontinuous. The leading part is denoted <b>50</b> <i>a </i>and the trailing part thereof is denoted <b>50</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0238"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective view depicting still another alternative embodiment where continuous planar wing <b>50</b> and discontinuous planar wings <b>50</b> <i>a </i>and <b>50</b> <i>b </i>are both replaced by a plurality of wheel assemblies. Wheels <b>59</b> <i>a</i>, <b>59</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>59</b> <i>c </i>are mounted on axles <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>63</b> <i>c</i>, respectively. The axles are formed of a flexible and resilient material and are diametrically split as at <b>63</b> <i>d</i>, <b>63</b> <i>e</i>, and <b>63</b> <i>f</i>, respectively. Thus, they are squeezed when the wheels are placed thereon so that when said axles are released from said squeeze, the axles expand and hold the wheels in place. Flat plate <b>66</b> and locating pin <b>68</b> collectively perform the function of parts <b>53</b> <i>a </i>and <b>53</b> <i>b </i>in the above-disclosed embodiments of planar wing <b>50</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0239"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A–F</figref> depict how the assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is inserted into printer receiving cavity <b>57</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0240">These wheels provide support at key positions during installation, engagement and removal of the cartridge from the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0241"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> depict an embodiment of the novel toner cartridge where two independently-generated electrical signals are used to activate a printer. Both signals are fed to a circuit board that activates the printer. One of the signals identifies a family of printers to which a printer belongs, and the other signal identifies the brand name of the printer within that family.</p>
  <p num="p-0242">Rotatably mounted dial <b>120</b>, also known as a brand selector switch, is mounted on circuit board <b>110</b> <i>a</i>. It has a plurality of discrete settings, collectively denoted <b>122</b>. Dial <b>120</b> enables a user to visually identify a printer by its brand name and to set dial <b>120</b> to a setting <b>122</b> that tells circuit board <b>110</b> what that brand name is.</p>
  <p num="p-0243">A conductive ribbon <b>124</b> interconnects circuit board <b>110</b> and a microswitch having an actuator that is actuated when contacted by a protuberance formed in a printer. Thus, the protuberance depresses the actuator and the microswitch sends a signal that indicates the printer family through ribbon <b>124</b> to circuit board <b>110</b> that enables the operation of the cartridge in the printer. Selector switch <b>120</b> <i>a </i>is also in electrical communication with circuit board <b>110</b>. In this way, the signal carried to the circuit board by ribbon <b>124</b> tells circuit board <b>110</b> what family the printer belongs to and the user, by manipulating selector switch <b>120</b> <i>a</i>, tells the circuit board the brand name of the printer within the family. So that the correct communication occurs, the brand and family information are then sent to an electronic device, not shown, that would be mounted on circuit board <b>110</b>. This semi-automatic switching system allows a cartridge to determine within which particular printer it has been installed.</p>
  <p num="p-0244">There are numerous possible positions for the microswitch and there may be any number and types of microswitches at differing positions. Moreover, the microswitch may be provided in many different forms. For example, depressible keypads of the type commonly used in microwave ovens, which may also be referred to as pressure-sensitive flexible printed circuit board switches, may be used in lieu of the switch depicted in said Figs. Moreover, the microswitch may take the form of an optical microswitch. All known microswitches are within the scope of this invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0245">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, microswitch <b>126</b> is positioned in a recess <b>126</b> <i>a </i>at the bight of leading end recess <b>16</b> <i>b </i>so that microswitch actuator <b>128</b> extends into said leading end recess. Accordingly, a force applied in the direction of directional arrow <b>130</b> activates actuator <b>128</b>. Such force is applied by a protrusion or protuberance formed in the printer into which the novel toner cartridge is inserted. Depression of actuator <b>128</b> by said protuberance activates microswitch <b>126</b> and said microswitch sends a signal to circuit board <b>110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0246">Second switch actuator <b>132</b> is positioned in one of the outboard recesses. It operates in the same way as actuator <b>128</b>, i.e., a force exerted in the direction of directional arrow <b>134</b> causes actuator <b>132</b> to close a switch and send a signal to circuit board <b>110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0247">The invention is not limited to this particular arrangement of microswitches because printer manufacturers may in the future change their respective printer structures. However, the principle of universality disclosed herein enables the designer of toner cartridges to change the switch positions or to add more switches as needed.</p>
  <p num="p-0248">However, the two switch/switch actuator arrangement of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A–C</figref> is very powerful in that it enables the identification of all of the printer families mentioned above. Thus, it enables the identification of all printers in the 520, 620, and 630 family of printers. It also identifies all printers in the Se/T family of printers as well as printers having no circuit boards. It does not identify the brand name of a printer within a family, said function being performed by a user as disclosed above.</p>
  <p num="p-0249">More particularly, a toner cartridge-receiving printer cavity having a front-mounted mounted, vertically disposed circuit board port <b>25</b> <i>c </i>and first and second protuberances <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>b </i>formed therein at opposite ends thereof as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16E</figref> is identified by contact with second switch actuator <b>132</b> which is positioned at the outboard edge of the novel universal waste bin as aforesaid. The switch associated with said actuator, when closed, sends a signal to the printer controller electronics, or universal printer chip, that activates a family of printers having said arrangement of first and second protuberances. In this example, the signal would activate any member of the 620 family of printers.</p>
  <p num="p-0250">More specifically, the signal will activate all of the following printers: Optra SE3455, Lexmark T620*, Lexmark T622*, IBM Infoprint 1130*, IBM Infoprint 1140*, Nashuatec P6015, Nashuatec P6230*, Nashuatec P6240*, Source Technologies ST915, Source Technologies ST920, Source Technologies ST925, Source Technologies ST935*, Source Technologies ST9130*, Source Technologies ST9140*, Source Technologies ST1130*, Source Technologies 1140*, Unisys UDS15, Unisys UDS20, Unisys UDS25, Unisys UDS35, Unisys UDS134*, Unisys UDS136*, Toshiba E-Studio 30P* and Toshiba E-Studio 40P*. All model numbers with an asterisk (*) use front-mounted, vertically-disposed circuit board contacts. The model numbers without an asterisk use horizontally-mounted circuit board contacts.</p>
  <p num="p-0251">A toner cartridge-receiving printer cavity having a front-mounted, vertically disposed circuit board port <b>25</b> <i>c </i>and a left of center protuberance <b>25</b> <i>d </i>formed therein as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16F</figref> is identified by absence of contact with actuator switch <b>128</b> positioned in the center recess of the waste bin and by absence of contact with actuator switch <b>132</b> positioned in a recess formed in the outboard edge of the waste bin. The lack of communication from either of such switches indicates that the printer is a member of the 630 family of printers.</p>
  <p num="p-0252">The toner cartridge-receiving cavity of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16F</figref> has utility with the following printers: Dell W5300n*, Lexmark T632*, Lexmark T634*, IBM Infoprint 1352*, IBM Infoprint 1372*, Source Technologies ST9340*, Source Technologies 1352*, Toshiba e-Studio 400P*, Unisys UDS 142*, and Unisys 144*. The asterisk (*) indicates that the printer uses front contacts, i.e., contacts that electrically engage vertically-mounted circuit boards.</p>
  <p num="p-0253">A toner cartridge-receiving printer cavity having a front-mounted, vertically disposed circuit board port <b>25</b> <i>c </i>and a centered protuberance <b>25</b> <i>e </i>formed therein as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16G</figref> is identified by contact with actuator switch <b>128</b> positioned in the center recess of the waste bin. Switch <b>126</b>, when closed, sends a signal to the printer controller electronics, or universal printer chip, that activates any member of the 520 family of printers. Printers in this family would not activate second switch actuator <b>132</b>. Thus, the 520 family is identified by the presence of a signal from first switch <b>126</b> and an absence of a signal from the switch actuated by actuator <b>132</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0254">The toner cartridge-receiving cavity of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16G</figref> has utility with the following printer models: Lexmark T520*, Lexmark T522*, Nashuatec P6220*, Nashuatec P6225*, IBM Infoprint 1120*, IBM Infoprint 1125*, Source Technologies ST9120*, Source Technologies ST9125*, Source Technologies 1120*, Source Technologies 1125*, Unisys UDS 130*, Unisys UDS 132*, Toshiba E-Studio 20P*, and Toshiba E-Studio 25P*, all of which use front contacts as indicated by the asterisk associated with each model.</p>
  <p num="p-0255">A toner cartridge-receiving printer cavity having a front-mounted, vertically disposed circuit board port <b>25</b> <i>c </i>and a right of center protuberance <b>25</b> <i>f </i>formed therein as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16H</figref> is identified by absence of contact with actuator switch <b>128</b> positioned in the center recess of the waste bin and by absence of contact with actuator switch <b>132</b> positioned in a recess formed in the outboard edge of the waste bin. The lack of communication from either of such switches indicates that the printer is also a member of the 630 family of printers.</p>
  <p num="p-0256">The toner cartridge-receiving cavity of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16F</figref> has utility with the following printer models, all of which use front contacts as indicated by the asterisk associated with each model: Lexmark T630*, IBM 1332*, Dell M5200N*, Source Technologies 9335*, and Source Technologies 1332*.</p>
  <p num="p-0257">A printer having a top-mounted, generally horizontally disposed circuit board takes precedence over any switch signals that might otherwise be communicated to denote a family of printers that singularly employ such horizontal circuit board mounting. In other words, signals from a switch or switches actuated by the presence of a particular arrangement of protuberances of the type that might be found in printers having front-mounted, vertical circuit boards are ignored if a top-mounted, generally horizontally disposed circuit board is detected. Any printer in the Se/T family of printers would thus be recognized.</p>
  <p num="p-0258">The novel universal waste bin of this invention is also compatible with printers having no circuit board ports, such as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16I</figref>. Such printers do not electrically communicate with their associated toner cartridges. A printer of such type requires no communication from its associated toner cartridge so there is no need for any switch to be actuated. Thus, signals that may be sent upon depression of switch actuators by a toner cartridge are ignored when a printer of this type is detected.</p>
  <p num="p-0259">Printers having no circuit board ports include the Optra S, Optra S 1250, Optra S 1255, Optra S 1620, Optra S 1625, Optra S 1650, Optra S1855, Optra S 2420, Optra S 2455, Unisys UDS 9712, Unisys UDS 9716, and 2 Unisys UDS 9718.</p>
  <p num="p-0260">As mentioned above, it is not enough to identify a printer just by the family to which it belongs. The 520 family includes printers sold under the brand names Lexmark®, Source Technologies®, Toshiba®, and IBM®. The 620 family includes printers sold under the same brand names as the 520 family, but the model numbers of the 620 family printers are different from the model numbers of the 520 family. Similarly, the 630 family includes the same printer brands as the 520 and 620 families, and with Dell® printers as well, but again with model numbers different from the model numbers of the 520 and 620 families.</p>
  <p num="p-0261">Thus it is necessary for a user to identify the brand name of the printer after the family has been automatically identified in the manner disclosed above. The user need not know which family the printer belongs to because that is determined by the structure just disclosed. However, when the user identifies the brand name of the printer in a particular family, the electronic circuitry then knows both the family and the printer within that family and the printer may then be activated with the correct electrical handshake and other required data.</p>
  <p num="p-0262">The printer selector switch <b>120</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> is of the rotary type. The printer selector switch <b>120</b> <i>a </i>depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref> is of the slide type, as is the switch depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17C</figref>. The invention is not limited to these two (2) types of selector switches. More particularly, in addition to rotary and slide-type selector switches, jumpers, button array, and other selector switches are within the scope of this invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0263"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17C</figref> depict the use of the above-mentioned pressure-sensitive flexible printed circuit board switches. They are denoted <b>128</b> <i>a </i>and <b>132</b> <i>a </i>to suggest that they are one of many substitute switches and switch actuators that may be used in lieu of actuators <b>128</b> and <b>132</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> also better depicts ribbon cable <b>124</b>. It should be understood, however, that ribbon cable <b>124</b> may be replaced by any equivalent conductor, including optical fibers, conventional wires, flexible circuit boards, and the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0264">As perhaps best understood in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, a channel <b>124</b> <i>a </i>is formed in the novel toner cartridge to accommodate ribbon cable <b>124</b> or its equivalent.

  <p num="p-0265">As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, recess <b>132</b> <i>b </i>accommodates switch actuator <b>132</b> <i>a </i>and as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>, recess <b>128</b> <i>b </i>accommodates switch actuator <b>128</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0266">An opening <b>134</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17C and 17D</figref>) is formed in a vertical wall of waste bin <b>12</b> between the outboard edge of toner cartridge <b>10</b> and an outboard edge of the sculpted leading end of said waste bin. The opening is structurally reinforced about its perimeter as denoted by the reference numeral <b>135</b>. Opening <b>134</b> enables ribbon cable <b>124</b>, and its equivalents, to follow a path of travel from vertical circuit board <b>110</b> to switch actuators <b>128</b> and <b>132</b> and their equivalents where at least part of that path of travel is internal to toner cartridge <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0267">Note in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> that in the absence of opening <b>134</b>, opening <b>138</b> must be formed in wall <b>140</b> to enable said ribbon cable to complete said path of travel.</p>

  <p num="p-0270">Label <b>115</b> is mounted in recessed area <b>117</b> and provides instructions to the user.

  <p num="p-0272">A similar construction is employed at a second, opposite end of ribbon cable <b>124</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17F</figref> where said ribbon cable is in electrical communication with vertically-mounted circuit board <b>110</b>. Terminal connector <b>125</b> <i>a </i>is mounted to the second end of ribbon cable <b>124</b> and said terminal connector <b>125</b> <i>a </i>makes electrical contact with receiving connector <b>125</b> that is mounted to said circuit board <b>110</b>.</p>

  <p num="p-0274">“L”-shaped circuit board <b>110</b> <i>b</i>, depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17G</figref>, has utility because it provides a mount for vertically-disposed receiving connector <b>129</b> to which vertically-disposed terminal connector <b>125</b> <i>a </i>may be secured in the absence of any bends in ribbon cable <b>124</b>. Note in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17F</figref> that connectors <b>125</b> and <b>125</b> <i>a </i>are horizontally and vertically disposed, respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0275"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> depict a substantially horizontal slot <b>142</b> having a flat, horizontally disposed upper wall <b>142</b> <i>a </i>and a flat, horizontally disposed lower wall <b>142</b> <i>b</i>.

The two half parts meet at folding line <b>148</b>. Specifically, the trailing end of leading half <b>144</b> <i>a </i>is hingedly connected to the leading end of trailing half <b>144</b> <i>b</i>. Hinge <b>150</b> is in alignment with folding line <b>148</b> and extends from the driven side of shutter <b>144</b> into slot <b>142</b>. Hinge <b>150</b> is therefore constrained to move within slot <b>142</b> as shutter <b>144</b> is opened and closed. More particularly, hinge <b>150</b> travels within slot <b>142</b> in a trailing-to-leading direction when shutter <b>144</b> is opened, and said hinge <b>150</b> travels within slot <b>142</b> in a leading-to-trailing direction when shutter <b>142</b> is closed.
