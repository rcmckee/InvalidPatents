A pair of elastomeric dampers are located each at the end of a support system sleeve which is sized to fit within a main housing to stabilize all internal support within a sealed unit. The result is a device which both facilitates the manual movement of the flashlight body so that the magnet slides past the center magnet pickup or current induction wire, and also conserves the residual momentum of the magnet once it has traveled past the magnet pickup or current induction wire by providing a bumper and spring to conserve some of the mechanical energy going in the other direction. Ninety second of manual activation enables about five minutes of illumination. A ready charger is disclosed which uses induction to charge the flashlight system by proximity to the manual charging magnet wire.</div>

    <p>This is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/112,848 filed Mar. 29, 2002.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to improvements in the technology relating to inexpensive and reliable lighting sources and more particularly to a human powered flashlight free of batteries and free of external integrity breaches and which is engineered to use light efficiently.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Production of light with a portable light source or flashlight is a well known expedient in which a tubular body is fitted with a number of series connected batteries. The disadvantages of conventional flashlights with this conventional configuration are generally (1) breach of internal external integrity from having to access the battery compartment fairly regularly to replace batteries, and (2) other breaches of external integrity associated with light bulb changes at the front of the device and from a mechanical linkage relating to the on and off switch.</p>
    <p>In some devices especially built for underwater use, a series of multiple “∘” rings may be employed for water sealing. However, when these structures are employed at points likely to be repeatedly accessed, such as the rear entrance to the battery compartment, degradation will likely occur resulting in an eventual breach of sealing integrity.</p>
    <p>Other step have been taken to insure integrity such as placing a flexible push button cover over the on and off switch, but these covers tend to either leak early in their functional life at the ring of circular attachment, or later in their functional life by cracking or punching breach. Seals around the bulb changing entrance, typically the front lens cover have proven to be more secure.</p>
    <p>Production of energy for lighting using generator devices are also known. In some cases a crank generator is provided with the crank extending through the housing, creating another source of housing fluid breach. Either a scientifically closely toleranced bearing must be provided to keep moisture out (close tolerance along with friction loss) or the generator must itself be water proof. The generator is itself a complex mechanical machine and also prone to water damage, rust, and excessive wear.</p>
    <p>Because of the breakdowns cited above, non-battery flashlights are generally unreliable as an emergency or long storage time period source of lighting, and particularly in a harsh or moist environment.</p>
    <p>Further, the majority of personal lighting products are generally inefficient as being operated using an incandescent (heated filament) light source which is not conserving of energy usage per unit of illumination. Most generator models require considerable hand crank input to effect any significant light output over time.</p>
    <p>What is therefore needed is a more compact, more isolated source of emergency lighting which is human powered, but which is also efficient in operation. The device should be impact resistant and have relatively few moving parts and no intense, high force, small area wear surfaces.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The light generating device of the present invention utilizes a large centrally located magnet which is mounted to slide past a magnet pickup or current induction wire which may be preferably mounted at a center point of travel in a tubular housing having a tubular chamber through which the magnet travels. A pair of elastomeric bumpers are located each at the end of the tubular chamber. Each of the elastomeric bumpers are supported by its own spring secured against the sides, end or both of the terminal ends of the tubular chamber. The mounting sequence is first chamber end or structure to first spring, to first bumper to freely slidable or translatable magnet to second bumper secured by second end or structure of the chamber. The result is a device which both facilitates the manual movement of the flashlight body so that the magnet slides past the center magnet pickup or current induction wire, and also conserves the residual momentum of the magnet once it has traveled past the magnet pickup or current induction wire by providing a bumper and spring to conserve some of the mechanical energy going in the other direction.</p>
    <p>Where the size of the magnet is matched to the length of the tubular chamber and the size of the springs, a matched, sealed mechanical system is formed which can be continuously operated with minimal wrist energy. The mechanical input energy is intended to be stored regardless of whether the light is operational during charging or not. The energy consumption of the lamp should be such that the mechanical charging action can keep sufficient energy stored in advance of its consumption in light production so that the flashlight of the invention can be continued to be utilized even when any temporary store of energy provided is depleted. This action is contemplated to be performed by shaking the flashlight several times to input mechanical and then electrical energy into storage, followed by a period of illumination from an energy reservoir, which may be chemical or capacitor or other.</p>
    <p>In addition, an activation switch for external control is had with an external smaller magnet which operates in conjunction with a reed switch to enable mechanical activation without the necessity to form a mechanical linkage between the inside and outside of the flashlight.</p>
    <p>One appliance which can greatly expand the capabilities of the flashlight of the invention is a charger which uses inductive energy transfer. Ordinary chargers rely upon physical touching of contacts and the corresponding external corrosion possibilities, as well as the possibility of non-contact with the outside energy source. Because the flashlight of the invention is completely sealed, inductive charging offers secure charging and no possibility of lack of charge through loss of physical contact.</p>
    <p>With a charge system, the flashlight is ready to go, ready to be employed in lighting on a moment's notice. A further addition is a paralleling of the on and off switch to be activated by an electromagnet in a charger housing especially in the case of power failure. Since the flashlight unit is self contained, a cessation of charging will not result in drain of the stored power. Further, a relay which operates to switch the flashlight on will enable its use as an emergency light to enable a user to find it and use it, and to handily pluck it from its charger and exit the building if needed. The flashlight can also be switched on while in the charger, to enable it to act as a continuously charged, fixed location night light, as well as a portable night light.</p>
    <p>The charger uses an induction system which has a physical realization matching the coil used in the charging system of the flashlight. Proximity to the charger, and its charging coil or proximity to the electromagnetic field produced by the charger will result in charging. As a result, the structure of the charger is not particularly constrained. A wall plug-in unit which is supported by an outlet and which further supports the flashlight is preferred, but a modular charger which has a wall transformer and a connected sleeve would also work well. The former enables deployment at various outlets in a room, while the latter enables more specialized orientation and deployment.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>The description and operation of the invention will be best initiated with reference to FIG. <b>1</b> and which illustrates a Faraday flashlight which will hereinafter be referred to as a flashlight <b>11</b>. The external appearance of the flashlight <b>11</b> discloses two portions, a main housing chamber <b>13</b> portion and a front cap <b>15</b> portion which is separated from the main housing chamber <b>13</b> portion by a dividing line <b>17</b>. Front cap <b>15</b> portion may include a combination or unitary clear cap which includes a threaded engagement portion and integral lens. In the version shown in the figures, a lens will be shown to be separate from the engagement portion of the cap, but this is just one possible variation. At the rear of the main housing chamber <b>13</b> is a protruding lug <b>19</b> having an opening <b>21</b> which is not immediately visible in FIG. 2, but which is indicated by arrow. An upper flattened portion <b>25</b> and a lower flattened portion <b>27</b> are seen in FIG. <b>2</b>. An expanded portion <b>29</b> of the main housing chamber <b>13</b> is seen as meeting front cap <b>15</b> at the dividing line <b>17</b>.</p>
    <p>At the top of the flashlight <b>11</b> an attached switch assembly <b>31</b> is seen as having an attached saddle <b>33</b> which overlies the cylindrical outer surface and a slide member <b>35</b> which has retaining members (not shown in FIG. 1) which fit within the saddle <b>33</b>. The whole of the switch assembly <b>31</b> may be mounted to the main housing chamber <b>13</b> by gluing, fusion, or the like. Switch assembly <b>35</b> acts by virtue of movement of a magnet within slide member <b>35</b> to a point over a portion of the housing chamber <b>13</b> at which a reed switch (not shown in FIG. 1) is located, and in order to close the reed switch by proximity of such magnet. It should be noted that the orientation of the flashlight <b>11</b> is such that the internals are protected from water and moisture, including the magnet wire <b>63</b> and magnet <b>65</b>. Magnet <b>65</b> typically may have a strength of N35, and the magnet wire <b>63</b> may have about 1600 turns. About 1.3 watt can be generated for each passage of the magnet <b>65</b> through the coil of magnet wire <b>63</b>.</p>
    <p>However, it is contemplated that the magnet <b>65</b> could be made to be external to the main housing chamber <b>13</b>, while the magnet wire <b>63</b> may be internally or externally located. Further, rather than simple movement of a straight tubular shaped main housing chamber <b>13</b>, the movement of the magnet <b>65</b> could be effected by other mechanical and configurational structure.</p>
    <p>As will be seen, the portion of main housing chamber <b>13</b> over which the saddle <b>33</b> is positioned may provide an accommodation space or depression to better accommodate saddle <b>33</b> and especially to protect its becoming dislodged upon external applied force, especially force along the main housing chamber <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>The front cap <b>15</b> is shown as being supplied with a series of indentations <b>39</b> which provide not only a decorative effect, but approximate a spacing for finger and hand manipulation. The flashlight <b>11</b> is intended to be waterproof, shockproof, and to generally never need servicing as it lacks any sort of bulb which could burn out. It uses a light emitting diode which is shockproof and is not generally expected to be changed. Indentations <b>39</b> may also assist machine placement of the front cap <b>15</b> consistently to a pre-determined torque in order to provide maximum sealing while minimizing the chance of overrunning the threads of attachment. Also seen is an end surface <b>41</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 2, a perspective view of the flashlight <b>11</b> as seen in FIG. 1, but looking toward the front end, illustrates further details within the cap <b>15</b>. Just within cap <b>15</b>, and beyond the end surface <b>41</b> is an angled surface <b>43</b>. Just beyond angled surface <b>43</b> is an inner cylindrical surface <b>45</b>. Adjacent the inner cylindrical surface <b>45</b> is a curved lens <b>47</b>. As will be seen, sealing will occur behind the curved lens <b>47</b> and the arrangement of structures is such that any moisture or water which enters the dividing space or dividing line <b>17</b> still must negotiate the seal behind the curved lens <b>47</b> in order to have an opportunity to further invade the inner workings of flashlight <b>11</b>. Also seen immediately to the rear of slide member <b>35</b> is a slide space <b>49</b> which defines the limits over which the slide member <b>35</b> may travel. In the configuration of FIG. 2 this is seen as allowing a forward and rearward motion along the main housing chamber <b>13</b> body, but an arrangement for side to side movement can be made.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 3, a front view of the Faraday flashlight <b>11</b> seen in FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrates the orientation of structures already covered in detail, as well as the visual effect of a main housing chamber <b>13</b> having an expanded portion <b>29</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4B, expanded views of a sectional view taken along line <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B of FIG. 2 are shown. Beginning at the end of the main housing chamber <b>13</b> closest the protruding lug <b>19</b>, and adjacent an internal surface <b>51</b> of the main housing chamber <b>13</b>, a centering sleeve <b>53</b> is supported by projections <b>55</b> and <b>57</b>. The centering sleeve <b>53</b> supports a magnet wire and magnet support assembly <b>59</b> which includes a magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> supporting 1600 turns of magnet wire <b>63</b> at a position approximate the center of travel of a magnet <b>65</b> which is mounted to freely axially slidably move within the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>. The term “magnet wire” is utilized only to indicate that this wire is intended to have induced currents due to the movement of a magnet.</p>
    <p>The end of magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> nearest the centering sleeve <b>53</b> includes a circumferentially outwardly directed groove <b>67</b> to enable it to fit within and be seated against the centering sleeve <b>53</b>. Near the center of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>, a pair of spaced apart lands <b>69</b> are provided to both stabilize the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> against the internal surface <b>51</b> of the main housing chamber <b>13</b>, and to provide a defined annularly radial volume for the magnet wire <b>63</b>. In the case shown in FIG. 4B, this volume includes a portion of the external surface of magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> shown with numeral <b>71</b> which has a smaller cylindrical radius to accommodate slightly more volume of the magnet wire <b>63</b>, but this need not be the case in every design.</p>
    <p>At a portion of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> opposite the circumferentially outwardly directed groove <b>67</b>, a radial land <b>73</b> is provided for stabilizing the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> against the internal surface <b>51</b> of the main housing chamber <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>Within and near the end of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> near the centering sleeve <b>53</b> a screw <b>75</b> secures a spring retainer <b>77</b> to the centering sleeve <b>53</b>. The spring retainer <b>77</b> further secures a rear spring <b>79</b>, at a first end of rear spring <b>79</b>, and within the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>, preferably in a manner that it will not contact or rub against an inner surface <b>81</b> of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>. A second end of the spring <b>79</b> is attached to a damper <b>83</b> by its rearwardly extending boss <b>85</b> around a central bore <b>87</b>.</p>
    <p>Within and near the end of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> near the radial land <b>73</b> a screw <b>75</b> secures a spring retainer <b>77</b> to an end wall <b>89</b> of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>. The spring retainer <b>77</b> further secures a front spring <b>91</b>, at a first end of front spring <b>91</b>, and within the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>, also preferably in a manner that it will not contact or rub against an inner surface <b>81</b> of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>. A second end of the front spring <b>91</b> is attached to a second damper <b>83</b> by its rearwardly extending boss <b>85</b> around a central bore <b>87</b>.</p>
    <p>As is further shown, the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> is not seen to end at the radial land <b>73</b>, but continues with a web portion <b>95</b> leading to a support <b>97</b> for supporting a gold capacitor <b>101</b> which may preferably be commercially available from Panasonic EECF5R5U105 and may have a value of up to one farad and is limited only by the limitations desired for energy storage capacity. Gold Capacitor <b>101</b> provides the energy storage for powering the flashlight <b>11</b>. Support <b>97</b> may continue with a wall <b>103</b>, as well as a wall which would be present to obstruct the view of FIG. 4A, but which is removed in order to see the sectional view of FIG. 4A. A divider <b>105</b> is seen located over the gold capacitor <b>101</b>. Above the divider <b>105</b> a reed switch bracket <b>107</b> supports one or more lengths of tape <b>109</b> for spacing a reed switch <b>111</b>. The reed switch <b>111</b> is underneath a position occupied by the forward most translation of slide member <b>35</b>. A small magnet <b>115</b> is shown within the slide member <b>35</b> and in a position over and just to the side of the reed switch <b>111</b>. Small magnet <b>115</b> is utilized to cause the reed switch <b>111</b> to close when the slide <b>35</b> is in its forward position. FIG. 4A also illustrates the depth of an external indentation <b>117</b> in the main housing chamber <b>13</b> which accommodates the small magnet underneath the slide <b>35</b> which translates within the attached saddle <b>33</b>. When the slide <b>35</b> and small magnet <b>115</b> are brought rearwardly within the saddle <b>33</b> and away from the reed switch <b>111</b>, the reed switch <b>111</b> will open to interrupt any lighting circuit present.</p>
    <p>Forward of the support <b>97</b>, a further support <b>121</b> connects the support <b>97</b> to a reflector housing <b>123</b>. At the rear of the reflector housing a light emitting diode <b>125</b> may be connected to circuitry <b>126</b>. Circuitry <b>126</b> will provide rectification of the alternating currents produced with the magnet wire <b>63</b> and magnet <b>65</b> for each travel length of the magnet <b>65</b>. Light emitting diode <b>125</b> is concentrically mounted within the reflector housing <b>123</b> and surrounded by a reflector material <b>127</b>. The inner cylindrical surface of reflector housing <b>123</b> may also be reflectorized. Just ahead of the reflector housing <b>123</b>, the internal surface <b>51</b> of the main housing chamber includes a groove <b>131</b> which is concentrically larger than internal surface <b>51</b>. Groove <b>131</b> has a radial surface width to fit an “∘” ring <b>135</b>. Groove <b>131</b> has an axial depth to accommodate both the “∘” ring <b>135</b> and about half the thickness of the lens <b>47</b>. The lens <b>47</b> is forced in place by the rearward projection of a butt end <b>137</b> of the inner cylindrical member <b>139</b> of which the inner cylindrical surface <b>45</b> was previously seen. As also can be seen, a mating space <b>141</b> is immediately adjacent the lens <b>47</b> and between the main housing chamber <b>13</b> and the front cap <b>15</b>. The mating space <b>141</b> leads to a threaded interface including an outer set of threads <b>143</b> on the main housing chamber <b>13</b> and an inner set of threads <b>145</b> on the front cap <b>15</b>. The other side of the threaded interface is in communication with the dividing line <b>17</b>.</p>
    <p>Note that any moisture or water must gain admittance in one of two paths. One path is through the dividing line <b>17</b>, thence through the threaded interface between outer set of threads <b>143</b> and inner set of threads <b>145</b> on the front cap <b>15</b> and to the edge of the lens <b>47</b>. The other path is between the outer periphery of the front face of the lens <b>47</b> and the continuous butt end <b>137</b> of the inner cylindrical member <b>139</b> of the front cap <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p>In order to enter the inside of the main housing chamber <b>13</b>, moisture must either go past the sealed barrier between the “∘” ring <b>135</b> and the groove <b>131</b>, or between the “∘” ring <b>135</b> and the periphery of a rear face <b>147</b> of the lens <b>47</b>.</p>
    <p>First, it is clear that the flashlight <b>111</b> can be provided with varying capacity members. For example, the magnet <b>65</b> has been found to work well utilizing a diameter size of about nineteen millimeters and a length of about 28 millimeters. The field strength of the magnet <b>65</b> will depend upon the material used. Variations might include the use of two magnets <b>65</b> separated by a plastic interconnect. In this configuration, the magnets would excite the magnet wire <b>63</b> twice for each tilt of the main housing chamber <b>13</b>. Ideally, the pair of magnets <b>65</b> could be reverse polarized so that one tilt would be equivalent to two tilts with one magnet. Three or four magnets could be joined together to give four actuations of the magnet wire <b>63</b> for each tilt of the flashlight <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>Conversely, multiple numbers of sections of the magnet wire <b>63</b> could be provided. Two sections of magnet wire <b>63</b> would produce twice the energy per tilt or travel of the magnet <b>65</b> from one end of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> to the other. Again, the strength of the springs <b>79</b> and <b>91</b>, combined with the hardness of the dampers <b>83</b> and the weight of the magnet <b>65</b> (or magnets <b>65</b>) will determine the natural frequency of shaking for activation of the flashlight <b>11</b>. Further, where the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> is made from nearly frictionless material and where the magnets <b>65</b> are made from a material complementary to the frictionless material of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>, very little energy from friction will be consumed and the bulk of the reverse magnetic EMF force will predominate as resistance to shaking the flashlight <b>11</b>. Insofar as any resistance from air entrapment within the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>, this can be vitiated by providing alternative routes for air to pass. Alternate routes can be accomplished by providing a core in the magnet <b>65</b>, or by providing side slots along the side edges of magnet <b>65</b>, or by providing long ribs along the inside of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> to provide a reduced surface wear area as well as spacing for displacement air to pass, or the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> itself could be provided with ventilation holes to allow air to pass in the space between the an outer surface <b>149</b> of magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> and internal surface <b>51</b> of the main housing chamber <b>13</b>, for example.</p>
    <p>Given the fact that the stored energy in the flashlight <b>11</b> is accomplished with a high efficiency gold capacitor <b>101</b>, the storage capability of the gold capacitor can be enlarged by utilizing either more capacitors <b>101</b> in parallel, or a larger capacitor <b>101</b>. Unlike storage batteries, a capacitor <b>101</b> will not suffer deleterious effects from being charged for long periods of time. Capacitors may have some leakage or some rating based upon inadvertent leakage, but regardless of this factor, there is no negative effects from keeping a constant charge. As such, the flashlight <b>11</b> is ideal for storage in a horizontal position in locations subject to movement. For example, storage under the seat of a truck laterally will result in movement of the magnet <b>65</b> from one end of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b> each time an alternative corner is turned. In more specialized structures, such as upon surfaces that turn slowly, the mounting of the flashlight <b>11</b> will provide a continuous charge. In machinery which undergoes significant shaking in a predominant direction, the flashlight <b>11</b> could also be mounted. The mounting method may vary, but any mounting external magnets should be located away from both the path of travel of the magnet <b>65</b>. In all of these cases, the flashlight <b>11</b> will automatically be available for use in a fully charged condition.</p>
    <p>Utilizing the structures described, it is expected that the resulting flashlight <b>11</b> could be manually shaken back and forth at approximately one movement per half second, for a total <b>90</b> seconds to make enough energy to power the light emitting diode <b>125</b> for about 5 minutes. The light output is preferably and deliberately low at about 6000 lux in order that the cycle time enable a user to have the ability “stay ahead” of the energy utilization time. In the example of a ninety second shake for about five minutes of illumination, and depending upon the capacity of the components, it will be preferable to perform the shaking at a time when the light emitting diode <b>125</b> is switched off via the switch assembly <b>31</b>. In emergency circumstances, the user who performs shaking with the light emitting diode <b>125</b> on, will experience a lesser cycle time and a jumpy light show. If the components were set to a vigorous ninety second shake followed by five minutes of operation, if the shaking occurred while the flashlight <b>11</b> was on, the five minutes would be reduced to about three and a half minutes.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 5, an exploded view of a further embodiment of the invention illustrates further internal details as well as the presence of a unitary body pinch flexure damper <b>151</b>. Also can be seen is a perspective view of an integrated internal support system <b>155</b> including the magnet wire and magnet support assembly <b>59</b>, web portion <b>95</b>, support <b>97</b> forming a semi enclosed circuits area, and attached reflector housing <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p>The integrated internal support system <b>155</b> forms a stable support structure which can be securely fixed within the main housing chamber <b>13</b> and which will stabilize and support the internals during the shaking operation. Because the system <b>155</b> extends essentially the length of the housing <b>13</b>, its implacement to bear against the rear of the housing <b>13</b> at its rear end, and the front of the housing by virtue of the pressure of the cap <b>15</b> when engaged on the front of the housing <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>Further details are seen beginning at the upper left side of the drawing. The saddle <b>33</b> is seen to include the slide space <b>49</b> through which the slide member <b>35</b> can axially translate. Small magnet <b>115</b> is seen as fitting under a matching space in the slide member <b>35</b>. As a result, a matching space <b>157</b> need only have a defined separation from the reed switch <b>111</b>.</p>
    <p>The space <b>157</b> need not be present, as the saddle <b>33</b> can be curved to fit on a cylindrical housing, but the use of a space <b>157</b> enables better control of the assembly process. The centering sleeve <b>57</b> is formed as a cover and has a central opening or aperture <b>159</b> to accommodate an anchor <b>161</b> of the unitary body pinch flexure damper <b>151</b>. Loading the damper <b>151</b> is as easy as threading the anchor <b>161</b> through the central opening to anchor it by friction or by adhesive or glue against the sleeve <b>57</b>. Inasmuch as the whole of the system <b>155</b> is under a stabilizing compression, the sleeve <b>57</b> and damper <b>151</b> will not tend to dislodge itself from its connection with the sleeve <b>57</b>.</p>
    <p>An aperture <b>163</b> in the end wall <b>89</b> will accommodate the other anchor <b>161</b> of the other pinch flexure damper <b>151</b>. Once the anchor <b>161</b> is threaded through the aperture <b>159</b> or <b>163</b> in either the sleeve <b>57</b> or the end wall <b>89</b>, the anchor <b>161</b> may be trimmed or clipped as is necessary to provide any clearance for objects with which the anchor <b>161</b> would otherwise interfere. Also seen are screws <b>163</b> which are used to hold the reed switch bracket <b>107</b> against a set of bare wires <b>165</b> which extend upward from the circuit board divider <b>105</b>. Another screw <b>167</b> is used to secure the gold capacitor <b>101</b> to the circuit boar divider <b>105</b>. All of the electronics fit within a box opening including the pair of oppositely spaced walls <b>103</b> and underlying support <b>97</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, a perspective and a side view of the unitary body pinch flexure damper <b>151</b> illustrates further details thereof. The anchor <b>161</b> may include a land <b>169</b> having a conic surface <b>171</b> and spaced apart from a base surface <b>173</b> of the damper <b>151</b>. A portion of the anchor <b>175</b> exists between the land <b>169</b> and the base surface <b>173</b> which will enable capture of the structures around the apertures <b>159</b> and <b>161</b> to help stabilize the damper <b>151</b>. The extent of the anchor <b>161</b> beyond the land <b>169</b> can be trimmed after installation if there is an interference problem. The main extent of the anchor <b>161</b> is to facilitate manual threading through apertures <b>159</b> and <b>161</b>, and tension to pull the land <b>169</b> through.</p>
    <p>Base surface <b>173</b> is part of a base <b>177</b>. A pair of hourglass shaped or angled side walls <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> extend from the base <b>177</b>. Each of the side walls curves gently toward each other for about half of their length and then back to form a top internal curve <b>185</b>. The curve <b>185</b> sits below a rounded solid end member <b>189</b>.</p>
    <p>The shaped, opposing nature of the side walls <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> insure that any axial compressive force borne between the solid end member <b>189</b> and the base <b>177</b> will result in the side walls <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> bending toward each other at their mid points. The first stage of deformation will occur as the side walls <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> bend about their mid sections with the mid sections of the side walls <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> being driven toward each other. The second stage of deformation will occur once the mid sections of side walls <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> have made contact, with the second stage of deformation resulting in the increase in surface area contact of the mid sections of the side walls <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> with each other.</p>
    <p>The first stage of deformation slows the movement of the magnet <b>65</b> less rapidly than the second stage of deformation. Because of the dampening action, no spring return force action is had with respect to the magnet <b>65</b>. This effect is due to the mass of the magnet which is about even with the mass of the remainder of the flashlight <b>11</b>. The mass amounts are such that a typical user's movements significantly move the flashlight back and forth and the path of travel of the magnet <b>65</b> is significantly shortened by movement of the flashlight <b>11</b> depending upon the severity and frequency with which it is shaken. The main action of the dampers <b>151</b> is to prevent the magnet <b>65</b> from making hard impact against the structure of the magnet wire and magnet support assembly <b>59</b>, especially where the flashlight <b>11</b> is shaken severely. Damping may also be aided by the clearance between the magnet <b>65</b> and the inner surface <b>81</b> of the magnet translation support sleeve <b>61</b>.</p>
    <p>The advantages of the flashlight <b>11</b> are clear in that a user can have a flashlight available for emergency use or backup use and which does not need batteries. The sealed unit of the flashlight <b>11</b> can be left idle for decades and then pressed into use. Because a capacitor <b>101</b> is used for energy storage and because capacitors, especially high efficiency (charge per unit weight) capacitors will typically drain its charge. As a result, a user who typically stores the flashlight <b>11</b> in a secure location must find and shake the flashlight <b>11</b> to energize it before it is ready to use.</p>
    <p>Further disclosed herein are ways of charging capacitor <b>101</b> which better enable the flashlight <b>11</b> to be used as an emergency light. Many emergency lights left in charging position for long periods of time fail because the storage cell typically used in such flashlights has either corroded, or failed because of being required to hold a charge for a long period of time. Where the charger is co-located with a conventional flashlight, the heat from the charger can damage the battery.</p>
    <p>The flashlight <b>11</b> is amenable for use with a charging coil which can charge the capacitor <b>101</b> through electromagnetic force energy received through the flashlight <b>11</b> main housing chamber <b>13</b>. The charger can be constructed in a variety of configurations to enable a high variety of support structures. In addition to an overlying sleeve, any housing which contains a coil or can transmit a magnetic field which can induce current in the magnet wire <b>63</b> will act to keep the capacitor <b>101</b> charged. This will enable a user to keep the flashlight <b>11</b> as a quick ready emergency flashlight which is instantly available from its charger. With an emergency which is associated with power failure, the flashlight <b>11</b> is ready to go and need only be shaken to supplement current which is used since retrieval from the charger.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 8, a block diagram illustrating the charger and its relationship with the overall flashlight <b>11</b> circuitry is shown. A POWER SOURCE INPUT line input block <b>201</b> is seen supplying power to CHARGER ELECTRONICS block <b>203</b>. The POWER SOURCE INPUT line input block <b>201</b> can be either an AC line input or a DC input having inverter electronics which will produce an alternating magnetic field. The charger electronics block <b>203</b> is connected to a charging coil <b>205</b>. The flashlight <b>11</b> is shown physically within the charging coil <b>205</b> to illustrate one manner with which an electromagnetic field can be induced into the magnet wire <b>63</b> within the flashlight <b>11</b>. The remaining portion of FIG. 8, beginning with magnet wire <b>63</b>, illustrates components associated with flashlight <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>The charging coil <b>205</b> is separated from but in close proximity to a coil of magnet wire <b>63</b>. Magnet <b>65</b> is shown in a position to move through the magnet wire <b>63</b>. Thus the magnet wire <b>63</b> is energized either by movement of magnet <b>65</b> or by an alternating electromagnetic field from the charging coil <b>205</b>.</p>
    <p>Magnet wire <b>63</b> is connected to a RECTIFIER block <b>211</b>. RECTIFIER block <b>211</b> is connected to an OVER VOLTAGE PROTECTION block <b>213</b>. The OVER VOLTAGE PROTECTION block <b>213</b> is connected to a CHARGE STORAGE CAPACITOR block <b>215</b>. One of a pair of leads from the CHARGE STORAGE CAPACITOR block <b>215</b> is connected in series through a REED SWITCH block <b>219</b>. The other lead from the a CHARGE STORAGE CAPACITOR block <b>215</b> and a lead from the REED SWITCH block <b>219</b> is connected to a WHITE (light) LED block <b>221</b>.</p>
    <p>WHITE LED block <b>221</b> is connected in parallel to an ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE PROTECTOR block <b>223</b>. A SLIDE KNOB block <b>225</b> is shown adjacent to but separated from the REED SWITCH BLOCK <b>219</b>. When the SLIDE KNOB block <b>225</b>, containing small magnet <b>115</b> is moved into proximity to the REED SWITCH BLOCK <b>219</b>, reed switch <b>111</b> closes to turn the flashlight <b>11</b> on. When the SLIDE KNOB block <b>225</b>, containing small magnet <b>115</b> is moved out of proximity to the REED SWITCH BLOCK <b>219</b>, reed switch <b>111</b> opens to turn the flashlight <b>11</b> off.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 9, a schematic illustrating the use of the flashlight <b>11</b>, shown as a rectangle supported by a charger housing <b>251</b> illustrates some support for the flashlight <b>11</b> housing <b>25</b> or at least some orientational registering of a charger housing <b>251</b> with respect to the flashlight <b>11</b> charger housing <b>251</b>. Within the charger housing <b>251</b>, a switch electro MAGNET block <b>255</b> is oriented to a position close to either (1) an auxiliary reed switch <b>256</b> which is connected in parallel with the reed switch <b>111</b>, or (2) directly to the reed switch <b>111</b>. Either the reed switch <b>111</b> or <b>256</b>, upon energization of the MAGNET block <b>255</b> to which the RELAY block <b>257</b> is connected, will cause the flashlight <b>11</b> to turn on.</p>
    <p>Since the switch assembly <b>31</b> is located over the reed switch <b>111</b>, a triggering electromagnet <b>255</b> would either cover or obstruct operation of the reed switch <b>111</b> and in some cases be affected by the small magnet <b>115</b>. By making a separate reed switch <b>256</b> wired in parallel with reed switch <b>111</b> and locating it elsewhere, a user has independent “on” control. A user can switch the flashlight <b>11</b> to the “on” position whether or not a power failure has occurred.</p>
    <p>In one case, the manual whenever the RELAY block <b>257</b> is energized by a CHARGER ELECTRONICS block <b>261</b>. The CHARGER ELECTRONICS BLOCK <b>261</b> is connected to a POWER SOURCE INPUT block <b>263</b>. Where the POWER SOURCE INPUT block <b>263</b> includes both line electrical input and a battery storage, it can switch to battery automatically upon power failure. An optional charger LED <b>265</b> can be used to not only indicate the energization of the charger <b>251</b> but also to provide some illumination upon power failure where the POWER SOURCE INPUT block <b>263</b> includes battery power.</p>
    <p>When the power input to the charger <b>251</b> fails, the POWER SOURCE INPUT block <b>263</b> switches to battery power and either energizes or maintains energization of the charging coil <b>205</b>. The POWER SOURCE INPUT block <b>263</b> then closes or opens the RELAY block <b>257</b> to energize or de-energize MAGNET block <b>255</b>. For maximum power savings, the steps will include opening a reed switch <b>111</b> or <b>256</b> with de-energization of MAGNET block <b>255</b> to enable the reed switch <b>111</b> to close by the cessation of a electromagnet in opposition to a permanent magnet, for example.</p>
    <p>In any event, the actuation of RELAY block <b>257</b> acts to close the reed switch ill to turn the flashlight <b>11</b> on. Preferably the charger <b>251</b> will be in a position to lend support to the flashlight <b>11</b> and preferably to orient flashlight <b>11</b> in a vertically upward orientation. This results in the combination charger <b>251</b> and flashlight <b>111</b> becoming a power failure light. A home or office equipped with a number of such charger <b>251</b> and flashlight <b>11</b> combination sets would experience automatic night lighting upon power failure. However, night lights cannot be removed and taken along. In situations where one or two occupants in a dwelling experience a power failure, they can not only have enough light to see, but can go directly to the flashlight <b>11</b> and remove it from the charger <b>251</b> and use the flashlight <b>11</b> to assist in evacuation of the building.</p>
    <p>In a business with a number of employees, and equipped with a large number of charger <b>251</b> and flashlight <b>11</b> combination sets, employees would each have a handy light to assist in evacuation. In both the home and business situations, a long evacuation route could be managed because of the ability to manually add power to the flashlight <b>11</b> by shaking. By having a charger <b>251</b> to provide constant charging, each of the flashlights <b>11</b> would be completely charged and ready to go in the event of a power failure.</p>
    <p>Again, the charger <b>251</b> can be of any shape which will communicate power to flashlight <b>11</b> and of any orientation which will enable actuation of the reed switch <b>11</b> upon loss of power. In the alternative, the relay <b>257</b> and electrically actuated magnet <b>255</b> need not be present for two other alternatives. In a first alternative, the flashlight <b>11</b> is maintained in the off position, but under constant charge. In this situation, the user must, upon power failure, find the charger <b>251</b> and flashlight <b>11</b> combination set in the dark. This is not the optimum situation, but is manageable where the charger <b>251</b> and flashlight <b>11</b> combination set is kept in an easily reachable location or where the charger carries its own illumination LED <b>265</b> </p>
    <p>A second alternative involves the flashlight <b>11</b> being left on permanently. As stated earlier the amount of light from the flashlight <b>11</b> is not high where a single white light emitting diode is used. Where the flashlight <b>11</b> is to be left on constantly, it will not output a significant amount of light in the daytime to be noticed. At night, the light output will be comparable to a night light. If left on constantly, the flashlight <b>11</b> should have a power input sufficient to keep the capacitor fully charged and to equal the amount of light output from the white light LED source <b>221</b>.</p>
    <p>Of course, in the most automated configuration, whenever the flashlight <b>11</b> is placed into a pre-determined resting position within the charger housing <b>251</b>, the charging coil <b>205</b> charges the magnet wire <b>63</b>. The charging coil <b>205</b> on the charger may preferably be in vertical position, in close proximity to the charging coil <b>205</b> when the flashlight <b>11</b> sits in vertical position to the charger <b>251</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 10, many of the features which are possible in FIGS. 8 and 9 have been combined into a single housing. A retractable AC power plug <b>275</b> is located at the lower end of the flashlight <b>11</b> housing <b>25</b>. The plug <b>275</b> is sufficient to support the flashlight <b>11</b> from a common alternating current outlet. Because the power is made available directly to the flashlight <b>11</b> housing <b>25</b>, the charging coil <b>205</b> to magnet wire <b>65</b> connection is not necessary.</p>
    <p>The power source <b>263</b> can be a capacitative power transfer device with a power pickup in the charger electronics <b>261</b>. Such an arrangement enables the inside of the housing <b>25</b> to continue its sealed relationship to the components seen in FIG. <b>5</b>. Capacitive transfer can be had with a separate line within the main housing chamber <b>13</b> connecting directly to the charger electronics <b>261</b>, or by direct conduction using connector terminals which formed at the time the housing <b>25</b> is formed. The seal of the main housing chamber <b>13</b> can be maintained by a variety of mechanical means combined with different structure to take power from the power plug <b>275</b> to the rectifier.</p>
    <p>The other components seen in FIG. 10 are the same as seen in the FIG. <b>9</b>. In the configuration shown, the flashlight <b>11</b> can be manipulated to deploy the blades of the plug <b>275</b> to a position for insertion in a wall plug. The modes of operation including (1) detection of loss of input power to then cause illumination of the LED <b>125</b>, or (2) constantly on as selectable by the user by manipulation of the reed switch <b>219</b> and preferably with enough power input capability to keep a full charge under conditions of constant illumination, or (3) constantly off and charging as selectable by the user and preferably assisted with a charging illumination LED <b>265</b> to assist location of an off flashlight <b>11</b> in the dark and (4) flash the illumination LED <b>265</b> in the event of an AC power failure.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 12, a front view of the housing <b>25</b> is shown with the AC power plug <b>275</b> seen as a pair of blades folded to a position flush with the housing <b>25</b>. In this manner, the AC power plug <b>275</b> can be deployed for charging and support from a wall outlet, and folded to a stowed position when carried or stored not in charging position.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 12 a more detailed schematic is shown. This schematic will illustrate alternating current conversion to a lower frequency field which matches, as much as possible, the natural frequency of the magnet wire <b>63</b>. The circuitry shown which is downstream of the first rectifier section could be used in conjunction with a direct current power source.</p>
    <p>Beginning at the left, a charger circuit <b>301</b> includes a plug <b>303</b> will take an alternating current input (such as 220 or 110 volt) from a wall socket as is typically found in the home. A switch SW<b>1</b>, connected to the line terminal of plug <b>303</b>, enables the charger circuit <b>301</b> to be turned off without removing the plug <b>303</b> from its wall connection. A filter set consisting of a parallel combination of a resistor R<b>1</b> and a capacitor C<b>1</b> supplies the filtered AC current to position <b>1</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b>. Position <b>3</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b> is connected to the other or neutral terminal of the plug <b>303</b>. Position <b>4</b> of the of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b> is grounded and position <b>2</b> of the of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b> forms a main node for the remainder of the connected circuitry of the charger <b>301</b>.</p>
    <p>Position <b>2</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b> is connected to ground through a capacitor C<b>2</b> and position <b>2</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b> is also connected to ground through a series combination of resistor R<b>2</b> and a light emitting diode ON LED.</p>
    <p>Position <b>2</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b> is connected through a resistor R<b>3</b> to the collector of a transistor Q<b>1</b>, the emitter of transistor Q<b>1</b> being grounded. The collector of transistor Q<b>1</b> is connected through a capacitor C<b>3</b> to the base of a transistor Q<b>2</b>. Further, position <b>2</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b>, is connected through a resistor R<b>4</b> to the collector of transistor Q<b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>Position <b>2</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b> is connected through a resistor R<b>6</b> to the collector of transistor Q<b>2</b> the emitter of transistor Q<b>2</b> being grounded. The collector of transistor Q<b>2</b> is connected through a capacitor C<b>4</b> to the base of transistor Q<b>1</b>. Further, position <b>2</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b>, is connected through a resistor R<b>5</b> to the collector of transistor Q<b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>The collector of transistor Q<b>2</b> is connected through a resistor R<b>8</b> to the base of a transistor Q<b>3</b>, the collector of transistor Q<b>2</b> the emitter of transistor Q<b>2</b> being grounded. Further, position <b>2</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>1</b> is connected through a series combination of a resistor R<b>7</b> and a coil L<b>1</b> to the collector of transistor Q<b>3</b>. The coil L<b>1</b> should have a size and matching characteristic with the coil of magnet wire <b>63</b> of the flashlight <b>11</b> to obtain maximum power transfer characteristic.</p>
    <p>Also seen, and shown somewhat schematically for orientation purposes, is the coil of magnet wire <b>63</b> and the charging magnet <b>65</b> which passes through it. The coil L<b>1</b> and coil of magnet wire <b>63</b> are enabled to be placed into a physical proximity such that energization of coil L<b>1</b> will energize the coil of magnet wire <b>63</b>. Structures which may accomplish this include providing a larger coil L<b>1</b> into which the flashlight <b>11</b> housing <b>13</b> may fit, or some such other compatible structure.</p>
    <p>Continuing with the circuitry for the flashlight <b>11</b>, the coil of magnet wire <b>63</b> is connected to positions <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> of a diode rectification bridge B<b>2</b>. Positions <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>2</b> are connected through a parallel combination of a 5.1 volt zener diode Z<b>1</b>, and a capacitor C<b>5</b> which is shown as capacitor <b>101</b> in the other views. Positions <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> of diode rectification bridge B<b>2</b> are connected through a series combination of reed switch <b>111</b> and illumination LED <b>125</b>, both of which were seen in the previous drawings.</p>
