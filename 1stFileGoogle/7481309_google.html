<p num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/962,183, filed Oct. 8, 2004, which was pending at the time of filing of this application and is presently abandoned.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Technical Field</p>
  <p num="p-0004">This application relates to a beverage bottling plant for filling bottles with a liquid beverage filling material, a beverage container filling machine, a beverage container closing machine, and a beverage container packaging machine. The present application further relates to a device for the separation and compacting of articles as described herein below.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">2. Background Information</p>
  <p num="p-0006">A beverage bottling plant for filling bottles with a liquid beverage filling material can possibly comprise a beverage filling machine with a plurality of beverage filling positions, each beverage filling position having a beverage filling device for filling bottles with liquid beverage filling material. The filling devices may have an apparatus designed to introduce a predetermined volume of liquid beverage filling material into the interior of bottles to a substantially predetermined level of liquid beverage filling material. The apparatus designed to introduce a predetermined flow of liquid beverage filling material further comprises an apparatus that is designed to terminate the filling of the beverage bottles upon the liquid beverage filling material reaching the predetermined level in bottles. There may also be provided a conveyor arrangement that is designed to move bottles, for example, from an inspecting machine to the filling machine. Upon filling, a closing station closes the filled bottles. There may further be provided a conveyor arrangement configured to transfer filled bottles from the filling machine to the closing station. Bottles may be labeled in a labeling station, the labeling station having a conveyor arrangement to receive bottles and to output bottles. The closing station and the labeling station may be connected by a corresponding conveyor arrangement.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Devices of this type are required inside packing machines to form and/or separate individual groups or articles or articles from article streams that arrive in uninterrupted rows and which are then to be packed in boxes, cases, trays and/or shrink-wrap.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">This packing process consists of a plurality of subprocesses, whereby the prior art uses individual machines, or at least individual, self-contained assemblies or modules to perform these subprocesses.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">First the article stream, which can comprise containers or commodities of all types such as bottles, bags, cans, boxes, bags etc., for example, is fed to the separating device by a conveyor.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">This conveyor is generally a device that is equipped with a wide conveyor belt and is also equipped with guides made of sheet metal, whereby these guides form alleys that are located above the conveyor belt.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">These alleys in turn separate the incoming article stream, which initially arrives in an unorganized manner, into rows.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">By means of a suitable separating device, this stream of articles standing pushed up against one another in the individual alleys is divided into the desired amount or number of articles, whereby the amount or number of articles is determined by multiplying the number of rows in the direction of travel by the number of rows at a right angle to the direction of travel. The separated rows in the direction of travel, in connection with the rows that run at right angles to the direction of travel, result in the format which is then to be packaged.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">To make it at all possible to package the format generated, it is necessary to create a space between the format that has just been generated and the stream of articles behind it. This gap is generally created by continuing to move the stream of articles forward at an unchanged speed, while the format generated is transported onward at an increased speed.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">The next step in the process represents what is termed the compacting step, and the purpose of which is to close any gaps that have been created inside the format by the guides and by potential displacements of the articles in relation to one another. For this purpose the format is moved by means of a suitable device through tapering outside guides, as a result of which any gaps produced by the guides are closed. Simultaneously, but also subsequently, the format is pushed off the conveyor and onto a stationary plate, as a result of which any spaces that still exist in the direction of travel inside the rows can also be closed.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">An additional important function that is performed during the compacting is the positioning of the formats at the correct intervals and/or the synchronization of the format with the machine clock rate. This function is necessary because repeated displacements in all dimensions can occur as a result of the upward, downward and forward movement of the articles or the format by or toward mobile or stationary device components, as a result of which the format may not be in the location where it is supposed to be according to the planned sequence of movements.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">The format compacted in the manner described above is then packaged.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">To realize the sequences described above, numerous teachings have been presented in the prior art, although one thing that all the teachings of the prior art have in common is that individual, self-contained assemblies are used at least for the separation and compacting/synchronization, which results in a complex and therefore expensive design and construction.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">Devices of the prior art are also very large on account of the numerous modules they comprise.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">A device of the prior art was described in DE 695 00 173, for example. On this device, individual series of articles in the stream of articles are first separated by finger-shaped elements that are inserted from below into the stream of articles and are then transported forward. The synchronization device then drops down from above between the separated rows of articles and begins to push and thereby synchronize them.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">This synchronization device thereby comprises synchronously driven parallel chains running on both sides of the container flow, whereby a plurality of bars are located on these chains so that the rods run at a right angle to the direction of transport and thus drive and synchronize the articles by their forward movement.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">One special characteristic of this device is that, at the beginning of the synchronization, two pairs of chains are engaged with each other, as a result of which each individual row of articles is individually transported by a single transverse bar. After traveling a certain distance, one of the two chain pairs is removed from the article stream, so that during the rest of the travel, only the remaining chain pair performs the subsequent compacting and synchronization, which also means that a plurality of transverse rows (rows of articles at a right angle to the direction of travel) are transported by one transverse bar, as a result of which the actual format is ultimately formed.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">One disadvantage of such a device is that the format produced can only be changed by installing or removing numerous transverse bars. Moreover, as a result of the engagement of the two chain pairs and the other design features of the device, not all desired formats can be produced.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">U.S. Pat. No. 3,194,382 describes another device of the prior art. On this device, during the separation process, all the transverse rows required for a format are separated directly and all at once from the article stream. In this device of the prior art, the separation is also performed by elements that are inserted into the article stream from below. The synchronization and compacting are done by a chain pair that is located above the transport plane, which is also provided with cross bars. This device also has the major disadvantage that changes to the format can only be made by extensive conversion measures, in particular of the separating unit, where in addition to replacing the chains that are being used, it is also necessary to transfer, move or replace the corresponding chain pulleys.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">An additional device of the prior art is described in DE 298 07 979. This device also works with individual components for the separation and synchronization/compacting, whereby a special device is proposed to separate the articles into groups. For the separator unit, instead of the guide plates of the prior art, guide rails are provided, whereby said guide rails are provided in sufficient number that each longitudinal row of articles is enclosed on both sides by guide rails. These guide rails are realized in the form of two complete sets, whereby each set is located in its own vertical plane, and whereby these sets are arranged on two vertical levels, one above the other.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">On each guide rail there is a linear sled or slide, which is provided with retaining levers that can be extended and retracted.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">Each of these linear sleds is driven by a drive chain that is connected with it, whereby all the linear sleds of one set or on one vertical level are driven and moved synchronously by a common servomotor.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">Because the linear sleds of the different sets are located on different vertical levels, they can be moved forward and backward completely independently of one another.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">The groups of articles are divided by having a first set of linear sleds with the retaining levers extended realize a forward motion, and thereby holding back the moving article stream with respect to the conveyor belt, which is moving at a higher speed. Simultaneously, a second set of linear sleds with the retaining levers retracted executes a reverse movement.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">When this second set of linear sleds has reached the terminal point of the reverse movement, the retaining levers are extended, as a result of which one group of articles is separated from the stream of articles. If the retaining levers are extended, the first set of linear sleds, by retracting its retaining levers, releases the leading edge of the group of articles just formed, so that the group just formed is then transported at the higher speed of the conveyor belt, and a space is therefore formed between the group of articles and the following article stream, which is held back by the second set of linear sleds.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The subsequent compacting/synchronization of the group of articles occurs in a separate device in the known manner.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">One disadvantage of such a device is that the stream of articles, which is in most cases already quite cohesive, must first be separated to some extent, because the linear sleds must be inserted between the individual longitudinal rows. Additional problems result from this arrangement, because in the process of compacting, very large gaps must be reduced, which can result in tipping, especially when the articles are sensitive to tipping, which is extremely undesirable in practice.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">The processing of articles that have rectangular cross sections also presents major problems, because a continuous external surface is formed when a plurality of such articles are jammed up against one another, as a result of which there is no suitable point of insertion for the retaining lever.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">The mechanical complexity and expense of such a device are additional disadvantages.</p>
  <heading>OBJECT OR OBJECTS</heading> <p num="p-0034">An object of the present application is to eliminate the disadvantages described above and to create a device that makes it possible to significantly reduce the costs involved, the number of components required and the amount of space occupied. The present application teaches that the separating unit and the compacting/synchronization unit are combined into a single unit.</p>

  <heading>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT OR EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows schematically the main components of one embodiment example of a system for filling containers, specifically, an embodiment of a beverage bottling plant <b>100</b> for filling bottles B with liquid beverage filling material, in accordance with one embodiment, or in which system or plant could possibly be utilized at least one aspect, or several an aspects, of the embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a rinsing arrangement or rinsing station <b>101</b>, to which the containers, namely bottles B, are fed in the direction of travel as is indicated by the arrow A<b>1</b>, by means of a conveyor line or conveyor arrangement to feed bottles to rinsing arrangement <b>103</b>, and downstream of rinsing arrangement or rinsing station <b>101</b>, in the direction of travel as is indicated by the arrow A<b>1</b>, the rinsed bottles B are transported to a beverage filling machine <b>105</b> by means of a conveyor line or conveyor arrangement <b>104</b> to pass bottles to filling machine that is formed, for example, by a starwheel conveyor or a plurality of starwheels of a conveyor arrangement. The conveyor arrangement <b>104</b> to pass bottles to filling machine may possibly comprise a starwheel conveying structure that introduces bottles B to the filling machine <b>105</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">Downstream of the filling machine <b>105</b>, in the direction of travel of the bottles B, there can preferably be a closing arrangement or closing station <b>106</b> which closes the bottles B.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">The closing arrangement or closing station <b>106</b> can, for example, be connected directly to a labeling arrangement or labeling station <b>108</b> having at least one labeling unit, device, or module for first product, each unit having a head, such as, for example, by means of a conveyor arrangement <b>107</b> to pass bottles to labeling arrangement that may be formed, for example, by a plurality of starwheels of a conveyor arrangement.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">In the illustrated embodiment, the labeling arrangement or labeling station <b>108</b> having at least one labeling unit, device, or module for first product, each unit having a head has, for example, three outputs, namely one output formed by a conveyor arrangement <b>109</b> to convey first product bottles for bottles B that are filled with a first product.

  <p num="p-0048">A second output that is formed by a conveyor arrangement <b>110</b> to convey second product bottles is provided for those bottles B that are filled with a second product. The second product may emanate from a second product mixer <b>124</b> that is connected, for example, through a conduit for second product <b>122</b> to the filling machine <b>105</b>, and these bottles B filled with a predetermined volume of liquid beverage filling material comprising the second product are then correspondingly labeled by a labeling module in the labeling arrangement or labeling station <b>108</b> having at least one labeling unit, device, or module for first product, each unit having a head, corresponding to this second product.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">A third output, for example, formed by a conveyor arrangement <b>111</b> to convey incorrectly labeled bottles, removes any bottles B which have been incorrectly labeled as may have been determined by an inspecting device or an inspecting station, or an inspecting module <b>128</b> that may possibly form a part of the labeling arrangement or labeling station <b>108</b> having at least one labeling unit, device, or module for first product, each unit having a head.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> item <b>112</b> is a central control arrangement or, expressed differently, a controller with a computer to process algorithms, which controls the operation of the above-referenced system or plant.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">The beverage filling machine <b>105</b> is preferably of the revolving design, with a rotor <b>105</b>′, which revolves around a vertical machine axis. The rotor <b>105</b>′ is designed to handle the bottles B by the neck. A filling arrangement <b>114</b> having at least one filling device, element, apparatus, or valve, comprises an apparatus configured to introduce a predetermined volume of liquid beverage filling material into the interior of bottles B to a predetermined level of liquid beverage filling material. Furthermore, the filling device or apparatus comprises an apparatus configured to terminate the filling of bottles upon liquid beverage filling material reaching the predetermined level in bottles B. In other words, the filling arrangements <b>114</b> having at least one filling device, element, apparatus, or valve, are configured and disposed to provide a predetermined flow of liquid beverage filling material from the source thereof, such as, product mixers <b>123</b> and <b>124</b>, into the bottles B.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The toroidal vessel <b>117</b> is a component, for example, of the revolving rotor <b>105</b>′. The toroidal vessel <b>117</b> can be connected by means of a rotary coupling or a coupling that permits rotation, and by means of the conduit for first product <b>121</b> to the external reservoir or first product mixer <b>123</b> to supply the product.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">As well as the more typical filling machines having one toroidal vessel, it is possible that in at least one possible embodiment a filling machine could possibly be utilized wherein each filling arrangement <b>114</b> having at least one filling device, element, apparatus, or valve is preferably connected by means of two connections to a toroidal vessel <b>117</b> which contains a first product, say by means of a first connection, for example, the conduit for first product <b>121</b>, and to a second toroidal vessel which contains a second product, say by means of the second connection, for example, the conduit for second product <b>122</b>. In this case, each filling arrangement <b>114</b> having at least one filling device, element, apparatus, or valve can also preferably have, at the connections, two individually-controllable fluid or control valves, so that in each bottle B which is delivered at the inlet of the filling machine <b>105</b> to a filling position <b>113</b>, the first product or the second product can be filled by means of an appropriate control of the filling product or fluid valves.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">It will be understood that while a two-product assembly or system of a bottling plant is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the disclosure is equally applicable to single-product installations, or other commensurate embodiments.</p>

The packaging machine pakages the bottles B into individual packages, such as six-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and 24-packs. The individual packages are then moved into a separating, synchronizing, and compacting device <b>200</b>A which arranges the individual packages in a desired manner. The individual packages are then moved to a machine <b>208</b>A to box the individual packages.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1B</figref>, for a separating and synchronization station <b>200</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) as claimed by the present application, there is at least one pair of drive elements <b>1</b>, on which at least one crossbar <b>2</b> is located.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">These drive elements can be chains, for example, that are made of metal or any other suitable materials, in particular roller link chains. Toothed belts can also be used, whereby in particular toothed belts are used to which the above mentioned crossbar <b>2</b> can be fastened by means of suitable components.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">In this context, the pair of drive elements <b>1</b> means drive elements that are driven by a common drive motor, and whereby one of these drive elements <b>1</b> is located to the left and one of these drive elements <b>1</b> to the right of the path of the group of articles to be divided or already divided.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, roller link chains were selected as the drive elements <b>1</b>. A total of three pairs of circulating drive elements <b>1</b> were installed, whereby two crossbars <b>2</b> are mounted on each drive element <b>1</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">The realization of variants with numbers of pairs of drive elements <b>1</b> and numbers of crossbars <b>2</b> that are different from the numbers in the illustrated exemplary embodiment would still be within the scope of this application.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Each of the pairs of drive elements <b>1</b> is driven by its own motor <b>3</b>, whereby this motor can be an electrically operated stepper motor, servomotor or synchronous motor, for example. What all these types of motors have in common is that the angle of rotation, the direction of rotation and the speed of rotation are specified by a computer or another suitable control device, and the maintenance of these specified values can be monitored by suitable monitoring devices such as a shaft encoder, for example, and transmitted for subsequent analysis.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">For the actuation and/or operation of these motors, the speed of rotation and/or the direction of rotation of the motor and thus also the speed of movement and/or the direction of movement of the pair of drive elements <b>1</b> driven by this motor can be adjusted to specified setpoints even within a whole rotation or a half rotation of the drive elements <b>1</b>. The present application also teaches that the speed of movement of the drive elements <b>1</b> can also reach the value zero m/s, whereby this value of the speed is not only automatically assumed during a possible change in the direction of movement, but can also be specified for a certain interval of time.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">The length of an operating cycle is determined by the number of crossbars <b>2</b> that are mounted on a pair of drive elements <b>1</b>. If only one crossbar <b>2</b> is installed, an operating cycle corresponds to one rotation of the drive elements <b>1</b>. On the other hand, if two crossbars <b>2</b> are installed, one work cycle corresponds to half a rotation of the drive elements <b>1</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the device is designed and constructed so that the individual drive elements <b>1</b>, because of the crossbars <b>2</b> that are located in a common vertical level, cannot pass each other. In an additional configuration of this embodiment, the drive elements <b>1</b> and/or crossbars <b>2</b> are arranged so that they can pass each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0065"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> comprises a control mechanism and computer <b>204</b> for operating this embodiment. The embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> further comprises a data input arrangement <b>206</b>, such as a push button arrangement. In operation, the computer control mechanism <b>204</b> is operatively connected to the motors <b>3</b>. The computer control mechanism <b>204</b> is programmed to monitor and control the operation of the motors <b>3</b> in order to produce desired movement of the drive elements <b>1</b> and the crossbars <b>2</b>. The data input arrangement <b>206</b> provides a user with an interface to input program commands to the computer control mechanism <b>204</b> in order to permit the separating and synchronizing device <b>200</b> to handle packages of various sizes, and possibly even various shapes. For example, the device <b>200</b> could be operatively connected to a packaging system that generates packages of different shapes and sizes. Therefore, during operation of the device <b>200</b>, it may become necessary to alter the movement of the crossbars <b>2</b> to handle a new series of individual packages that are of a different size or shape than the previous packages. In such a situation, a worker monitoring the operation of the device <b>200</b> could press a button, for example, on the data input arrangement <b>206</b> that initiates a program in the computer control mechanism <b>204</b> that is specific to the particular package size or shape. The computer control mechanism <b>204</b> then adjusts the operation of the motors <b>3</b> according to the selected program, and thereby adjusts the movement of the drive elements <b>1</b> and crossbars <b>2</b> to handle the new series of packages entering the device <b>200</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the individual illustrations <b>2</b> <i>a </i>to <b>2</b> <i>g </i>show a particularly advantageous sequence of movement of an embodiment. To simplify the illustration, the articles to be packed, which in this exemplary embodiment can be bottles, for example, are not shown individually. Instead, only the envelopes of the groups of articles that have already been separated or are to be separated are shown (e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>a</i>, items B and C, or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>d</i>, items C and D).</p>
  <p num="p-0067">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a detailed illustration of the three drive elements <b>1</b> has been omitted, and only the path of movement <b>4</b> of the drive elements <b>1</b> is shown in the form of a schematic diagram. The crossbars <b>2</b> that are fastened to the three drive elements <b>1</b> are identified to show their correspondence to the individual drive elements <b>1</b>. For example, the crossbars <b>2</b> identified as K<b>2</b> are fastened to the second drive element <b>1</b> and the crossbars <b>2</b> identified as K<b>3</b> correspond to the third drive element <b>1</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">The articles to be separated and synchronized are fed to the separation, synchronization and compacting device <b>200</b> by an inlet conveyor <b>5</b>, whereby the articles are held continuously under dynamic pressure inside the separator unit by the continuous motion of the inlet conveyor <b>5</b> and thus have a constant tendency to move in the desired direction.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">Inside the device, the articles are first pushed by the inlet conveyor <b>5</b> onto a stationary, i.e. non-moving component, e.g. a plate <b>8</b>. Underneath this plate is a hold-back wedge <b>7</b> which executes a controlled sequence of movements. This sequence of movements consists of a forward and backward movement at differing, not necessarily constant speeds, and optionally including additional defined immobile phases.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">The main conveyor <b>6</b> is adjacent to the plate <b>8</b> and/or the hold-back wedge <b>7</b>. This main conveyor <b>6</b> is operated at a constant speed, which is higher than the speed of the inlet conveyor <b>5</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">The essential components of the sequence of movement of a device as claimed by the present application are explained in greater detail below, although the description is provided exclusively for purposes of illustration and is not intended to limit or restrict the scope of the present application in any way. Variations of the described or illustrated sequence of movement as well as the omission or inclusion of movements and/or components would still be within the scope of protection of present application.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>a</i>, the following article stream is held under dynamic pressure by the inlet conveyor <b>5</b>, so that the groups of articles B and C to be separated subsequently can be adjacent to each other without any gaps. For the actual separation, the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> performs a very important function. During the forward movement of the article stream, the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> is also extended, and holds back the group of articles B to be separated during this forward movement, which prevents this group of articles from coming into contact with the main conveyor <b>6</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The contact of the article group B to be separated with the main conveyor <b>6</b> must be prevented for the time being, because the main conveyor <b>6</b> is operated at a higher belt speed than the inlet conveyor <b>5</b>, and on account of the speed difference, premature contact would result in the premature and thus undesirable formation of a gap inside the group of articles to be separated.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">If the length of the group of articles to be separated is greater than the effective length of the hold-back wedge <b>7</b>, i.e. if a portion of the group of articles is already on the main conveyor <b>6</b>, the crossbar K<b>1</b> which moves at the speed of the inlet conveyor <b>5</b> prevents the formation of a gap inside this group of articles.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">If the article group B to be separated is far enough above or on the main conveyor <b>6</b>, the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> executes a reverse movement, as a result of which the entire article group B to be separated is set down on the main conveyor <b>6</b> and thus assumes the higher speed of the main conveyor <b>6</b>. Because the crossbar K<b>1</b> at this time also assumes the higher speed of the main conveyor <b>6</b>, the desired space between article group B and the following article group C is formed.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">The backward movement of the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> ends at the leading edge of the next article group C to be separated. When this leading edge is reached, the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> again follows the forward movement of article group C, whereby it travels at the same speed as article group C (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>b</i>).</p>
  <p num="p-0077">If the space between article group B and C is large enough (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>c </i>and <b>2</b> <i>d</i>), the next crossbar <b>2</b>, in this case K<b>2</b>, is inserted into the space thus formed and prevents the premature formation of a space inside the following article group C, whereby the crossbar K<b>2</b>, after it is inserted into the space, moves essentially at the speed of the inlet conveyor <b>5</b> in the direction of forward motion. Simultaneously the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> is extended further, whereby it maintains contact with the leading edge of article Group C and prevents this article group from coming into contact with the main conveyor <b>6</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Once the preceding article group B has been transported a certain distance by the main conveyor, the speed of the corresponding crossbar K<b>1</b> is increased, as a result of which it moves away from the article group B.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>e </i>and <b>2</b> <i>f</i>, the crossbar K<b>1</b> is moved at a higher speed than the main conveyor <b>6</b> until the crossbar reaches the trailing edge of the preceding article group A. Once it reaches the trailing edge, the crossbar K<b>1</b> resumes the speed of the main conveyor <b>6</b> and pushes the article group A through the compacting unit, which is not shown in the illustration.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">These compacting units are part of the prior art and conventionally consist of guide plates that are located on both sides of the path of the article group to form a funnel-shaped bottleneck, as a result of which any gaps that may remain between the transverse rows of the article group are closed. Any gaps that may remain inside the longitudinal rows are closed by pushing the article group onto a stationary component, such as a plate, for example, whereby the crossbar K<b>1</b> pushes the article group forward.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">When the crossbar K<b>1</b> has then pushed the article group off the stationary component, all the gaps inside the article group have been closed and the article group is correctly positioned and synchronized with the machine cycle. The crossbar is then removed from the plane of the article groups.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">Beyond the advantage described above, namely that the separation, synchronization and compacting stations are realized in the form of a single module, the altogether advantageous configuration of the embodiment described above has additional advantages.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">For example, it is easy to change the formats to be produced, in particular with a constant number of transverse rows, because to change the number of longitudinal rows, all that is necessary is to change the programmed sequence of movements of the drive chains <b>1</b> and hold-back wedge <b>7</b>, which can practically be done just by “pressing a button” without the need for any mechanical modifications to the packing machine itself.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">To realize this function, the present application teaches that the required profile of the movements of the drive elements <b>1</b> and hold-back wedge <b>7</b> and other control parameters, such as the speeds of the conveyors <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, for example, can be stored in the machine control system for each desired format and/or for each article to be processed, so that relevant data can be easily retrieved by the operating personnel.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">The advantages of this embodiment become particularly apparent when there are frequent changes of articles, even when the format remains unchanged, because different articles generally also have different dimensions, which on packing devices of the prior art requires complicated and time-consuming adjustment operations. These complicated changeover operations are practically eliminated altogether on a device of the type claimed by the present application.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">As a result of the combination of the functions of separation, synchronization and compacting into a single module, it is possible to significantly reduce the required length of the machine, which in turn makes possible a significant reduction in costs, because of the not-insignificant cost of space.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">The embodiment has a further significant advantage: Because, on a device of the type claimed by the present application, it is not necessary to locate components inside the path of the separated article groups, it becomes possible to realize at least the main conveyor <b>6</b> in the form of a wide, one-piece conveyor belt that has an essentially uninterrupted surface, which has the advantage over similar arrangements of the prior art, where it is customary to construct the main conveyor <b>6</b> from a plurality of narrow conveyor belts that run parallel, that there are no discontinuities in the surface that can cause articles to fall or tip over during transport, or especially during the compacting process.</p>
  <p num="p-0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and comprises a packaging machine <b>207</b> to package individual articles into individual packages, and a machine <b>208</b> to box the individual packages. The embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> further comprises a motor and transmission <b>202</b> to move the hold-back wedge <b>7</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also shows the control mechanism and computer <b>204</b> and the data input arrangement <b>206</b>. The computer control mechanism <b>204</b> is operatively connected to the motor and transmission <b>202</b> to monitor and control the operation thereof, and thereby monitor and control the operation of the hold-back wedge <b>7</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">To further explain, in at least one possible embodiment, the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> is initially located under the plate <b>8</b>, which plate <b>8</b> connects the inlet conveyor <b>5</b> and the main conveyor <b>6</b>. Each individual article group or pack is pushed across the plate <b>8</b> by the article group or pack immediately behind and in contact with it. As the leading edge of an article group or pack approaches the end of the plate <b>8</b>, and substantially simultaneously the beginning of the main conveyor <b>6</b>, it is important that the article group or pack temporarily be prevented from contacting the main conveyor <b>6</b> to prevent the article group or pack from being pulled away prematurely by the conveyor <b>6</b>. The hold-back wedge <b>7</b>, in at least one possible embodiment, moves forward at essentially the same speed as the article group or pack traveling across the plate <b>8</b>. The hold-back wedge <b>7</b> can act essentially as an extension of the plate <b>8</b> and support the article group or pack over the main conveyor <b>6</b>. In at least one possible embodiment, once an appropriate amount of time has elapsed to allow a preceding article group or pack to move forward on the main conveyor <b>6</b>, the hold-back wedge <b>7</b>, in at least one embodiment, retracts back under the plate <b>8</b>, thereby allowing the article group or pack to make contact with the main conveyor <b>6</b>. The hold-back wedge <b>7</b>, in at least one embodiment, contacts an inclined surface <b>7</b>A (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) on or adjacent the end of the main conveyor <b>6</b>, such that as the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> moves forward with an article group or pack, the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> contacts the inclined surface <b>7</b>A and is inclined or raised very slightly in a vertical direction to prevent the article group or pack from contacting the main conveyor <b>6</b> prematurely. In at least one other possible embodiment, the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> extends like a sheath over the main conveyor <b>6</b> to support the article group or pack over the main conveyor <b>6</b> to prevent premature contact. In at least one other possible embodiment, the plate <b>8</b> and the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> form a single structure that moves back and forth to permit movement of the article group or packs from the inlet conveyor <b>5</b> to the main conveyor <b>6</b>. In that embodiment, there is a gap between the two conveyors <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and the hold-back wedge <b>7</b> moves back to initially support an article group or pack C, then moves forward with the pack C to hold the pack C over the main conveyor <b>6</b>. The article group or pack D, which is immediately behind and in contact with the article group or pack C on the hold-back wedge <b>7</b>, can be held in place in a clamping manner by being pressed against pack C by either another pack behind pack D or by the driving force of the inlet conveyor <b>5</b>.</p>
