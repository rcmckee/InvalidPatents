    <p>This is a Division of application Ser. No. 09/240,007 filed Jan. 29, 1999. The disclosure of the prior application(s) is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to semiconductor devices, and particularly relates to a semiconductor device which acquires data signals based on a data-strobe signal.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>According to some proposed schemes, semiconductor devices such as those functioning as memory devices may acquire address signals in synchronism with a clock signal, and input or output data signals in synchronism with a data-strobe signal different from the clock signal with an aim of achieving a stable data input/output at high speed.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 is a timing chart showing operations of a semiconductor device which acquires data in synchronism with a data-strobe signal. This device operations and timings thereof are conceived by the inventors for the sake of showing an example.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 shows a case in which data acquisition is performed based on a DDR (double data rate) scheme acquiring data in synchronism with both rising edges and falling edges of a data-strobe signal. A clock signal CLK is shown at the top, and a data-strobe signal DS is illustrated in the middle. At the bottom in the figure is demonstrated a data signal DQ which is acquired in synchronism with the data-strobe signal DS. The example of FIG. 1 demonstrates data-acquisition timings of a burst-write operation where the burst length is set to 4 to write 4-bit data D<b>0</b>-D<b>3</b> consecutively.</p>
    <p>At a first rising edge (clk<b>1</b>) of the clock signal CLK, a write command and a write address WA<b>1</b> indicative of a start address are input. The write command is decoded by a command decoder, and is supplied to the write-command latch of the semiconductor device, which in turn supplies a write-enable signal. The write-enable signal activates buffers to receive the data-strobe signal DS and the data signal DQ, respectively. The data signal DQ received by one of the buffers is acquired (latched) by a latch in synchronism with the data-strobe signal DS received by the other one of the buffers. Since it takes some time to generate the write-enable signal and activate the buffers, a time period tDSS from the input of the write command (clk<b>1</b>) to the timing of a first rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS needs to be at least 3 ns, for example.</p>
    <p>Data D<b>0</b> is latched at the first rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS, and data Dl is latched at an immediately following falling edge. A next write address WA<b>2</b> is internally generated at the second rising edge (clk<b>2</b>) of the clock signal CLK. Data D<b>2</b> is then latched at an immediately following rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS, and data D<b>3</b> is latched at a subsequent falling edge.</p>
    <p>In the DDR scheme, the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are latched by two different latches. Immediately after the data D<b>1</b> is latched, the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are simultaneously supplied in parallel to the internal circuit of the semiconductor device. Accordingly, data is input at half the cycles of the strobe signal, while the internal circuit operates at the same cycles as that of the strobe signal. The write address at which the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are stored is WA<b>1</b>. Further, immediately after the latching of the data D<b>3</b>, the data D<b>2</b> and D<b>3</b> are simultaneously supplied in parallel to the internal circuit of the semiconductor device. In this case, the write address is WA<b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>In the semiconductor device as described above, the data-strobe signal DS input by the user preferably has a timing thereof permitting a tolerable timing margin.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 is a timing chart of a data-acquisition operation in which the first rising edge of a data-strobe signal is delayed by one clock cycle behind the input of a write command.</p>
    <p>At a first rising edge (clk<b>1</b>) of the clock signal CLK, a write command and a write address WA<b>1</b> are input from an external source. The first rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS is delayed relative to the input of the address WA<b>1</b> by one clock cycle, appearing at a timing clk<b>2</b>. This rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS is used to latch data D<b>0</b>, and a following falling edge is used to latch data D<b>1</b>. A next write address WA<b>2</b> is internally generated at the second rising edge (clk<b>2</b>) of the clock signal CLK. Data D<b>2</b> is then latched at a following rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS appearing at a timing clk<b>3</b>, and data D<b>3</b> is latched at an immediately following falling edge.</p>
    <p>Upon the latching of the data D<b>1</b>, the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are supplied to the internal circuit of the semiconductor device in parallel. The write address for the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> is WA<b>1</b>. A write address which was internally generated by the semiconductor device at an immediately preceding timing (clk<b>2</b>) is, however, WA<b>2</b>. Because of this, a simplistic structure which stores an incoming write address in a conventional buffer results in the write address WA<b>1</b> being replaced by the write address WA<b>2</b> by the time when the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are supplied to the internal circuit.</p>
    <p>In order to avoid this, the write addresses WA<b>1</b> and WA<b>2</b> need to be successively stored in a shift register or the like, for example. In such a configuration, the write address WA<b>1</b> would have to be read at a timing when the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are supplied to the internal circuit, and the write address WA<b>2</b> would have to be read at a timing at which the data D<b>2</b> and D<b>3</b> are supplied to the internal circuit.</p>
    <p>Implementing address buffers via shift registers is effective where a clock signal and a data-strobe signal are input at such timings as shown in FIG. 2, but is not applicable to a case where these signals are input at such timings as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. Since shift registers need some time to complete shift operations thereof, the shift registers used as the address buffers may not be able to output proper addresses at a time when a write operation of data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> starts in FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>When the time period tDSS has such a length as shown in FIG. 1, it is required to use a write address acquired at a timing immediately prior to the supply of data to the internal circuit. That is, when the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are supplied to the internal circuit, for example, the write address acquired immediately before is WA<b>1</b>, so that the write address WA<b>1</b> needs to be provided to the internal circuit along with the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b>. In contrast, when the time period tDSS is such a period as shown in FIG. 2, the write address WA<b>2</b> acquired at an immediately preceding timing should not be used, but the write address WA<b>1</b> that is acquired at a timing previous to this preceding timing should be used with respect to the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b>, as described above.</p>
    <p>If the data-strobe signal is to permit a tolerable timing margin, there is a need to attend to control of address-read operations so as to read an appropriate address from an address buffer at an appropriate timing.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, there is a need for a semiconductor device which allows a data-strobe signal to be provided within a tolerable timing margin when acquiring data in synchronism with the data-strobe signal.</p>
    <p>Further, a semiconductor device employing a data-strobe signal acquires data and addresses in synchronism with respective timing signals. That is, data is acquired in response to a data-strobe signal, and addresses are acquired in response to a clock signal. Because of a timing difference between a data acquisition and an address acquisition, it is difficult for an internal circuit to perform accurate data processing and data transfer at high speed by matching data with correct addresses.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, there is a need for a semiconductor device which can process data and addresses at high speed when the data and addresses are acquired at different timings.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device which can satisfy the need described above.</p>
    <p>It is another and more specific object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device which allows a data-strobe signal to be provided within a tolerable timing margin when acquiring data in synchronism with the data-strobe signal.</p>
    <p>It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device which can process data and addresses at high speed when the data and addresses are acquired at different timings.</p>
    <p>In order to achieve the above objects according to the present invention, a semiconductor device which receives addresses in synchronism with a clock signal and receives data in synchronism with a strobe signal includes address-latch circuits, a first control circuit which selects one of the address-latch circuits in sequence in response to the clock signal, and controls the selected one of the address-latch circuits to latch a corresponding one of the addresses in response to the clock signal, and a second control circuit which selects one of the address-latch circuits in sequence in response to the strobe signal, and controls the selected one of the address-latch circuits to output a corresponding one of the addresses in response to the strobe signal.</p>
    <p>According to one aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above further includes data-latch circuits, each of which latches a corresponding datum of the data in synchronism with the strobe signal, and outputs the corresponding datum of the data in synchronism with the strobe signal.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above is such that the data-latch circuits operate in response to a write-enable signal which is generated in response to a write command to the semiconductor device.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above is such that said write-enable signal controls said first control circuit and said second control circuit to operate for a predetermined time period after receiving the write command.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above is such that the first control circuit includes a first frequency divider configured to divide a frequency of the clock signal, and selects one of said address-latch circuits in sequence by using the frequency-divided clock signal from said first frequency divider, and said second control circuit includes a second frequency divider configured to divide a frequency of the strobe signal, and selects one of said address-latch circuits in sequence by using the frequency-divided strobe signal from said second frequency divider.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above further includes an increment-latch circuit which latches one of the addresses in synchronism with the clock signal, and an address-generation circuit which increments the one of the addresses latched by said increment-latch circuit by 1, and supplies the incremented address to said address-latch circuits, wherein each of said address-latch circuits configured so as to be capable of selecting the corresponding one of the addresses externally provided or the incremented address supplied from said address-generation circuit for the latching operation thereof.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above is such that said data-latch circuit comprises a first data-latch circuit which latches a corresponding datum of the data in synchronism with a rising edge of the strobe signal, and a second data-latch circuit which latches a corresponding datum of the data in synchronism with a falling edge of the strobe signal.</p>
    <p>In the semiconductor device which receives the addresses in synchronism with the clock signal and receives data in synchronism with the strobe signal, the address-latch circuits latch the addresses in response to the clock signal, and outputs the addresses in synchronism with the strobe signal. During this operation, the addresses are written one after another into a successively selected one of the address-latch circuits, and are read therefrom successively. This makes it possible to simultaneously supply the data and the corresponding addresses to the internal circuit in synchronism with the strobe signal. An appropriate data-write operation is thus achieved regardless of the timing of the data-strobe signal as long as this timing falls within a tolerable margin.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor device which receives addresses in synchronism with a clock signal and receives data in synchronism with a strobe signal includes data-latch circuits, a first control circuit which selects one of said data-latch circuits in sequence in response to the strobe signal, and controls the selected one of said data-latch circuits to latch a corresponding datum of the data in response to the strobe signal, and a second control circuit which selects one of said data-latch circuits in sequence in response to the clock signal, and controls the selected one of said data-latch circuits to output a corresponding datum of the data in response to the clock signal.</p>

    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above is such that the write-enable signal controls said first control circuit and said second control circuit to operate for a predetermined time period after receiving the write command.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above is such that said first control circuit includes a first frequency divider configured to divide a frequency of the strobe signal, and selects one of said data-latch circuits in sequence by using the frequency-divided strobe signal from said first frequency divider, and said second control circuit includes a second frequency divider configured to divide a frequency of the clock signal, and selects one of said data-latch circuits in sequence by using the frequency-divided clock signal from said second frequency divider.</p>

    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above is such that said address-latch circuit includes a delay circuit which delays output timings of the addresses by a predetermined number of cycles of the clock signal.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, the semiconductor device as described above further includes an address buffer, wherein said address-latch circuit(s) supplies the addresses to said address buffer without a clock-cycle delay during a read operation.</p>
    <p>In the semiconductor device which receives the addresses in synchronism with the clock signal and receives data in synchronism with the strobe signal, the data-latch circuits latch the data in response to the strobe signal, and outputs the data in synchronism with the clock signal. During this operation, the data are written one datum after another into a successively selected one of the data-latch circuits, and are read therefrom successively. This makes it possible to simultaneously supply the data and the corresponding addresses to the internal circuit in synchronism with the clock signal. An appropriate data-write operation is thus achieved regardless of the timing of the data-strobe signal as long as this timing falls within a tolerable margin.</p>

The latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> latch the input addresses in synchronism with the clock signal CLK under the control of the latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b> when these input addresses are supplied from the address buffer <b>13</b>, which receives the addresses in synchronism with an internal clock signal iCLK. Alternatively, the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> latch internal addresses iAdd generated by the increment latch <b>24</b> and the address generator <b>25</b>. Further, the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> supply the latched addresses to the address buffer <b>28</b> in synchronism with the data-strobe signal DS under the control of the latch-output-clock generator <b>19</b>. The input addresses have a first one thereof latched by the latch <b>26</b>, and are latched thereafter by the latch <b>27</b> and the latch <b>26</b> in turn. When the latched addresses are supplied to the address buffer <b>28</b>, a first one is supplied form the latch <b>26</b>, and the subsequent data are supplied from the latch <b>27</b> and the latch <b>26</b> in turn.</p>
    <p>A configuration as described above can cope with the case in which the time period tDSS is the shortest as shown in FIG. 1 as well as the case in which the time period tDSS is the longest as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>In the case of the shortest tDSS as shown in FIG. 1, the latch <b>26</b> latches the address WA<b>1</b> in synchronism with the clock signal, and outputs the address WA<b>1</b> at an edge of the data-strobe signal corresponding to the timing at which the data D<b>1</b> is supplied. Then, the latch <b>27</b> latches the address WA<b>2</b>, and the address WA<b>2</b> is output at an edge of the data-strobe signal corresponding to a timing of the data D<b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>In the case of the longest tDSS as shown in FIG. 2, the address WAl is latched by the latch <b>26</b>, and, then, the address WA<b>2</b> is latched by the latch <b>27</b>. At an edge of the data-strobe signal corresponding to a timing of the data Dl, the address WA<b>1</b> is output from the latch <b>26</b>. Then, the address WA<b>2</b> is output from the latch <b>27</b> at an edge of the data-strobe signal corresponding to a timing of the data D<b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> output addresses to the address buffer <b>28</b> in synchronism with the data-strobe signal. Likewise, in synchronism with the data-strobe signal, the shift register <b>15</b> and the data latch <b>16</b> output data in parallel to the write amplifiers <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>. Because of this, the internal circuit operating in synchronism with the data-strobe signal can process data signals and address signals at high speed with sufficient accuracy. Here, the internal circuit refers to a set of circuits provided at stages subsequent to the address buffer <b>28</b>, the shift register <b>15</b>, and data latch <b>16</b>, and includes the predecoders <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, the write amplifiers <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, the sense amplifiers <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, the column decoders <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, etc.</p>
    <p>In the first embodiment of the present invention described above, the input addresses are stored in the two latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> which are provided in parallel. The addresses stored in the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are then subsequently read at appropriate timings, thereby coping with any timings of the data-strobe signal DS supplied within a tolerable timing margin ranging from the shortest tDSS to the longest tDSS.</p>
    <p>In what follows, operations of the semiconductor memory device <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
    <p>The command decoder <b>22</b> receives a command Comm (i.e., a combination of control signals such as /RAS, /CAS, /CS, /WE, and the like) in synchronism with the clock signal CLK, and decodes the same to generate a write signal wrpz and a CAS signal when the command is a write command. These signals are comprised of HIGH pulses. The CAS signal is also generated in response to other commands such as a read command. When the CAS signal is supplied to the clock generator <b>501</b>, an external-timing-pulse signal extpnz is generated as a one-shot HIGH pulse. After this, the clock generator outputs HIGH pulses as an internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz in synchronism with the internal clock signal iCLK until the burst-length-measurement counter outputs a burst-end signal endz (L level). The burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b> measures the burst length. The burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b> is reset by the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz, and, then, counts the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz as many times as the burst length, which is stored in the mode register <b>502</b> in advance. When the counting is completed, the burst-end signal endz is output to the write-command latch <b>23</b> in response to the internal clock signal iCLK. The write-command latch <b>23</b> outputs a write-enable signal wrtz that is at a HIGH level in response to the write signal wrpz sent from the. command decoder <b>22</b>, and resets the write-enable signal wrtz when receiving an endpz signal (L level) from the burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b>.</p>
    <p>The internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz and the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz are supplied to the latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b> to control generation of latch-input clocks. External-latch-input clocks extplz and extprz are used for controlling acquisition of external addresses by the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, and internal-latch-input clocks intplz and intprz are used for controlling acquisition of internal addresses by the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>.</p>
    <p>The write-enable signal wrtz is supplied to the data-input buffer <b>11</b> and the data-strobe-input buffer <b>12</b> so as to enable these buffers. The write-enable signal wrtz is also supplied to the frequency divider <b>17</b> and the frequency divider <b>18</b>, thereby prompting a start of frequency-division operations of the frequency dividers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>The write-enable signal wrtz is output from the write-command latch <b>23</b> only for a predetermined duration following the input of the write command. this makes it possible to make the frequency dividers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> operate only with respect to a predetermined number of cycles.</p>
    <p>The data-input buffer <b>11</b> receives the data signal DQ when being enabled by the write-enable signal wrtz. The data-strobe-input buffer <b>12</b> enabled by the write-enable signal wrtz receives the data-strobe signal DS, and outputs a DS<b>1</b> signal having a rising edge synchronized with a rising edge of the DS signal and a /DS<b>1</b> signal rising in synchronism with a falling edge of the DS signal. The DS<b>1</b> signal is supplied to the data latch <b>14</b>, the frequency divider <b>17</b>, and the latch-output-clock generator <b>19</b>, and the /DS<b>1</b> signal is supplied to the shift register <b>15</b> and the data latch <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>The data signal DQ received by the data-input buffer <b>11</b> is stored in the data latch <b>14</b> in synchronism with the DS<b>1</b> signal. A next one of the data signal DQ is stored in the data latch <b>16</b> in synchronism with the /DS<b>1</b> signal. The data signal DQ stored in the data latch <b>14</b> is further stored in the shift register <b>15</b> in synchronism with the data-strobe signal /DS<b>1</b>. When data DO and Dl are successively supplied, therefore, the shift register <b>15</b> stores the data D<b>0</b>, and the data latch <b>16</b> stores the data D<b>1</b>. Then, the shift register <b>15</b> and the data latch <b>16</b> output the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> in parallel to the write amplifiers <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively, in synchronism with the /DS<b>1</b> signal. The data latches <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> and the shift register <b>15</b> together form a serial-to-parallel conversion unit <b>505</b>.</p>
    <p>The data stored in the shift register <b>15</b> and the data latch <b>16</b> are provided to the internal circuit, and, in detail, are supplied to the sense amplifiers <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> via the write amplifiers <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively. Operation timings of the write amplifiers <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> are controlled by the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT supplied from the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b>. Column addresses for selecting sense amplifiers to store data therein when the data is supplied to the sense amplifiers <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> are supplied from the predecoders <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> to the column decoders <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>, respectively, where the column addresses are decoded. The data stored in the sense amplifiers <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> are then supplied and stored in the odd-numbered-cell array <b>36</b> and the even-numbered-cell array <b>37</b>, respectively. The odd-numbered-cell array <b>36</b> and the even-numbered-cell array <b>37</b> are comprised of DRAM-memory-cell arrays, for example. Each cell array includes a plurality of memory cells arranged in a matrix and comprised of memory-cell capacitors and access transistors, a plurality of word-lines arranged in a row direction for the purpose of selecting the access transistors, and a plurality of bit lines arranged in a column direction for the purpose of conveying data from the memory cell via the access transistors to the sense amplifiers and writing the data of the sense-amplifiers into the memory cells.</p>
    <p>Further, the odd-numbered-cell array and the even-numbered cell array respectively correspond to odd addresses and even addresses. When the address WAl of FIG. 1 is an odd address, for example, the data D<b>0</b> is written into memory cells selected from the odd-numbered-cell array, and the data D<b>1</b> is written into memory cells selected from the even-numbered-cell array.</p>
    <p>During a read operation, on the other hand, data of selected memory cells in the odd-numbered-cell array <b>36</b> and the even-numbered-cell array <b>37</b> are supplied to and amplified by the sense amplifiers <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>, respectively. Then, data is output from the sense amplifiers selected by the column decoders <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>, and is supplied in parallel to the read amplifiers <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>, respectively. The data of the read amplifiers <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> are converted into serial data by the parallel-to-serial conversion unit <b>503</b>. The serial data is then output to outside from the data pins DQ via the output buffer <b>504</b>.</p>
    <p>The clock signal CLK is supplied to the internal-clock generator <b>21</b>. The internal-clock generator <b>21</b> in turn generates the internal clock signal iCLK which is synchronized with the external clock signal CLK.</p>
    <p>The frequency divider <b>17</b> divides a frequency of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> in response to the write-enable signal wrtz, and generates a frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x. Similarly, the frequency divider <b>18</b>, upon receiving the write-enable signal wrtz, divides a frequency of the internal clock signal iCLK to generate a frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z.</p>
    <p>The latch-output-clock generator <b>19</b> generates latch-output clocks ds<b>2</b>px and ds<b>2</b>pz based on the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> and the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x. The latch-output clocks ds<b>2</b>px and ds<b>2</b>pz are pulse signals, and become HIGH in turn at falling edges of the data-strobe signal DS. That is, each of them becomes HIGH at every other falling edge of the data-strobe signal DS.</p>
    <p>The latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>px controls timings of address output of the latch <b>26</b>, and the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>pz controls timings of address output of the latch <b>27</b>. In this manner, addresses are output from the latch <b>26</b> and the latch <b>27</b> in turn.</p>
    <p>The latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b> receives the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz, which is the one-short-pulse signal supplied from the clock generator <b>501</b> in response to a command input, and outputs the same as either the external-latch-input clock extplz or the external-latch-input clock extprz according to whether the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is HIGH or LOW. In a burst-write operation, the latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b> receives the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz from the clock generator <b>501</b> after receiving the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz. Then, the latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b> outputs the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz as either the internal-latch-input clock intplz or the internal-latch-input clock intprz according to whether the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is HIGH or LOW.</p>
    <p>The latch <b>26</b> latches an address signal Add supplied from the address buffer <b>13</b> when the external-latch-input clock extprz is HIGH. Also, the latch <b>26</b> latches an internal address signal iAdd supplied from the address generator <b>25</b> when the internal-latch-input clock intprz is HIGH. Then, the latched address signal is supplied to the address buffer <b>28</b> when the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>px is HIGH.</p>
    <p>The latch <b>27</b> latches an address signal Add supplied from the address buffer <b>13</b> when the external-latch-input clock extplz is HIGH. Also, the latch <b>27</b> latches an internal address signal iAdd supplied from the address generator <b>25</b> when the internal-latch-input clock intplz is HIGH. Then, the latched address signal is supplied to the address buffer <b>28</b> when the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>pz is HIGH.</p>
    <p>The address signal is supplied from the address buffer <b>28</b> to the predecoders <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>. Based on a timing of a column-selection pulse csp supplied from the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b>, the predecoders <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> attends to predecoding processing. Decoded address signals obtained as a result of predecoding are supplied to the column decoders <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>. The column decoders <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> indicate data-write addresses by further decoding the results of predecoding.</p>
    <p>The increment latch <b>24</b> and the address generator <b>25</b> are provided for the purpose of automatically generating internal addresses during a burst operation. In a burst operation, the increment latch <b>24</b> latches external addresses supplied from the address buffer <b>13</b> in synchronism with the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz supplied from the clock generator <b>501</b>. The address generator <b>25</b> adds <b>1</b> to the address output from the increment latch <b>24</b> to generate an internal address iAdd, and sends the internal address iAdd to the increment latch <b>24</b> and the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>. The increment latch <b>24</b> latches the internal address in response to the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz from the clock generator <b>501</b>. After this, acquisition of an internal address by the increment latch <b>24</b> and an address increment by the address generator <b>25</b> are repeated as many times as the burst length minus <b>1</b>. Here, the burst length is specified in the mode register <b>502</b>.</p>
    <p>The write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b> receives the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> and the internal clock signal iCLK, and outputs the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT and the column-selection signal csp in accordance with an operation mode specified by the write-enable signal wrtz. Namely, when a write operation is specified (wrtz=H), the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b> outputs the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT and the column-selection signal csp at a predetermined timing in response to the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b>. When a read operation is specified (wrtz=L), the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b> generates the column-selection signal csp in response to the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz and the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz, and puts the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT in an deactivated state (i.e., fixed at a L level) so as to stop operations of the write amplifiers <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 4A through 4I are timing charts showing input/output timings of the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>.</p>
    <p>These figures show the clock signal CLK, the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z, the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz, the external-latch-input clock extprz, the external-latch-input clock extplz, the data-strobe signal DS, the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x, the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>px, and the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>pz in this order from the top to the bottom. FIGS. 4A through 4I show a case in which the burst length is <b>4</b>, and an address is input along with a write command at each rising edge of the clock signal CLK. As previously described, the latch <b>26</b> acquires the first external address signal based on the external-latch-input clock extprz, and outputs the same based on the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>px. In the case of the latch <b>27</b>, the next external address signal is acquired based on the external-latch-input clock extplz, and the same is output based on the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>pz.</p>
    <p>As is apparent from the figures, the address acquired by the latch <b>26</b> in response to the external-latch-input clock extprz is supplied to the address buffer <b>28</b> always earlier than the other address that is acquired one clock later by the latch <b>27</b> in response to the external-latch-input clock extplz. Also, two addresses (A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>) latched at successive rising edges of the clock CLK are stored in the separate latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, respectively, so that the first address (A<b>1</b>) is retained even when the second address is input. Further, a data-output timing of parallel data output from the shift register <b>15</b> and the data latch <b>16</b> and an address-output timing of addresses output from the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are based on the data-strobe signal. Because of this, the internal circuit can match data with a corresponding address by using the data-strobe signal as a reference. In FIGS. 2A through 2I, the address A<b>1</b> latched by the latch <b>26</b> in response to the first rising edge of the clock signal CLK is output to the address buffer <b>28</b> at a falling edge of the data-strobe signal indicated by t=1. Matching the address A<b>1</b>, the data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> respectively latched by the shift register <b>15</b> and the data latch <b>16</b> are also output to the write amplifiers <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> at the falling edge of the data-strobe signal at the time t=1. Namely, although different timing signals (i.e., the clock signal and the data-strobe signal) are used for establishing synchronizations when the semiconductor device acquires an address and data, the internal circuit can process the address and data in synchronism with the common timing signal (i.e., data-strobe signal in this example).</p>
    <p>According to the first embodiment of the present invention as described above, the two latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> provided in parallel, rather than a shift register, store the input addresses, and output the same at respective appropriate timings. In this manner, the data-strobe signal DS can be provided at any timing within the timing margin between the shortest tDSS and the longest tDSS while an appropriate operation is insured.</p>
    <p>In what follows, a description will be provided with regard to a configuration of each element which is relevant to latch-input/output timings of address signals according to the present invention.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram showing a circuit configuration of the frequency divider <b>17</b> or <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>The frequency divider <b>17</b> or <b>18</b> of FIG. 5 includes NAND circuits <b>101</b> through <b>109</b>, inverters <b>110</b> through <b>113</b>, a PMOS transistor <b>114</b>, and NMOS transistors <b>115</b> and <b>116</b>. The write-enable signal wrtz is supplied to the NAND circuits <b>101</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>109</b>. This makes sure that the frequency divider of FIG. 5 operates only when the write-enable signal wrtz is HIGH. When the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> or the internal clock signal iCLK is input while the write-enable signal wrtz is HIGH, a frequency-divided output signal changes to a HIGH level in response to the first rising edge of the input signal, and, then, the input signal is subjected to ½-frequency division to be output as the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x or the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z, respectively. When the write-enable signal wrtz is LOW, the output of the frequency divider is fixed to HIGH. Frequency-division operations per se are well within the scope of ordinary skill in the art, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 is a circuit diagram showing a circuit configuration of the latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>The latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b> of FIG. 6 includes NAND circuits <b>121</b> through <b>127</b> and inverters <b>128</b> through <b>132</b>. When the write-enable signal wrtz is HIGH, a signal having the same phase as the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is supplied via the inverter <b>132</b> and the NAND circuit <b>121</b> to one input of the NAND circuit <b>124</b>. The other input of the NAND circuit <b>124</b> receives the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz. During periods when the frequency-dividedclock signal clk<b>2</b>z is HIGH, the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz is output as the external-latch-input clock extplz. Further, an inverse of the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is supplied via the NAND circuit <b>123</b> to one input of the NAND circuit <b>125</b>. The other input of the NAND circuit <b>125</b> receives the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz. During periods when the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is LOW, therefore, the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz is output as the external-latch-input clock extprz. In an example of FIGS. 4A through 4I, the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz is output in synchronism with rising edges of the clock pulse CLK, and the frequency-divided-clock signal clklz starts from an L level and changes between H and L at each rising edge of the clock. In the example of FIGS. 4A through 4I in a write operation, therefore, the latch-input-clock generator first supplies an extprz-signal pulse to the latch <b>26</b>, and, then, supplies an extplz-signal pulse to the latch <b>27</b>. In this manner, the external addresses are latched first by the latch <b>26</b> and next by the latch <b>27</b>. When the write-enable signal wrtz is LOW, the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz is output as the external-latch-input clocks extplz and extprz at all times.</p>
    <p>In the case of a burst-write operation, the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz is supplied as many times as the burst length after the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz is first supplied in synchronism with a rising edge of the clock at which the write command is input.</p>
    <p>When the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz is supplied, the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz is output as the latch-input clock intplz during time periods when the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is HIGH. During time periods when the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is LOW, on the other hand, the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz is output as the latch-input clock intprz. In the case of a burst-write operation, the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz is supplied during a period when the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is LOW, so that the latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b> outputs the external-latch-input clock extprz. In response, the latch <b>26</b> latches an external address Add. After the frequency-divided clock changes to HIGH, the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz is supplied, so that the latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b> outputs the internal-latch-input clock intplz. In response, the latch <b>27</b> latches an internal address iAdd generated by the address generator <b>25</b>. Where the write-enable signal wrtz is LOW, the latch-input clocks intplz and intprz become identical to the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 is a circuit diagram showing a circuit structure of the latch-output-clock generator <b>19</b>.</p>
    <p>The latch-output-clock generator <b>19</b> of FIG. 7 includes NAND circuits <b>141</b> through <b>145</b>, inverters <b>146</b> through <b>152</b>, and capacitors Cl and C<b>2</b>. The data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> input to the inverter <b>146</b> is delayed by a series of delay elements comprised of the inverters <b>147</b> through <b>149</b> and the capacitors Cl and C<b>2</b>. The NAND circuit <b>141</b> and the inverter <b>150</b> perform an AND operation between an inverse of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> and the delayed data-strobe signal, thereby generating a pulse signal becoming HIGH at falling edges of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b>. This pulse signal is output as the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>px via the NAND circuits <b>143</b> and <b>145</b> when the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x is HIGH. When the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x is LOW, on the other hand, the pulse signal is output as the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>pz via the NAND circuits <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. Where the write-enable signal wrtz is LOW, both the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>pz and ds<b>2</b>px are fixed to HIGH.</p>
    <p>In the example of FIGS. 2A through 2I, the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x becomes HIGH in response to a first rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS, so that the latch-output-clock generator <b>19</b> first outputs the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>px. In response, the latch <b>26</b> supplies the address latched therein to the address buffer <b>28</b>. Then, the latch-output-clock generator <b>19</b> outputs the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>pz, which prompts the latch <b>27</b> to supply the latched address to the address buffer <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram showing a circuit structure of the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> as well as the address buffer <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>The latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> in FIG. 8 have the same configuration, and include inverters <b>161</b> through <b>168</b> and transfer gates <b>169</b> through <b>172</b>. Each of the transfer gates <b>169</b> through <b>172</b> is comprised of a PMOS transistor and an NMOS transistor. When the external-latch-input clock extplz (or extprz) becomes HIGH, the transfer gate <b>169</b> is opened, so that the external address signal Add from the address buffer <b>13</b> (FIG. 3) is latched by a latch comprised of the inverters <b>164</b> and <b>165</b>. The address signal stored in the latch is supplied to the address buffer <b>28</b> when the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>pz (or ds<b>2</b>px) becomes HIGH so as to open the transfer gate <b>172</b>.</p>
    <p>Where the internal-latch-input clock intplz (or intprz) is supplied, an incremented internal address signal iAdd supplied from the address generator <b>25</b> (FIG. 3) is latched by a latch comprised of the inverters <b>167</b> and <b>168</b>. The incremented address signal iAdd is then stored in the latch made up from the inverters <b>164</b> and <b>165</b> at a timing when the latch-input clock intplz (or intprz) becomes HIGH. The address signal stored in the latch is supplied to the address buffer <b>28</b> via a transfer gate <b>172</b> when the gate is opened during a HIGH period of the latch-output clock ds<b>2</b>pz (or ds<b>2</b>px).</p>
    <p>The address buffer <b>28</b> includes inverters <b>181</b> through <b>185</b>. The address buffer <b>28</b> stores the address signal supplied serially from either the latch <b>26</b> or the latch <b>27</b>, and outputs the address signal and an inverse thereof.</p>
    <p>When the write-enable signal wrtz is LOW (i.e., in a read operation), the latch-input clocks extplz and extprz prompt the latching of the address signal Add, or the latch-input clocks intplz and intprz trigger the latching of the address signal iAdd. As previously described in connection with FIG. 7, the address signal latched in the latch <b>26</b> or <b>27</b> is immediately supplied to the address buffer during a read operation since the latch-output clocks ds<b>2</b>pz and ds<b>2</b>px are HIGH. In this manner, the configuration described above insures that only a minimum time period is necessary before supplying an address output subsequent to the input of a read command.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 is a circuit diagram showing a circuit structure of the increment latch <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>The increment latch <b>24</b> of FIG. 9 includes inverters <b>201</b> through <b>209</b> and transfer gates <b>210</b> through <b>212</b>. Each of the transfer gates <b>210</b> through <b>212</b> is made up from a PMOS transistor and an NMOS transistor. When the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz becomes HIGH during a burst-write operation, the transfer gate <b>210</b> is opened, so that the external address signal Add is stored as a start address in a latch comprised of the inverters <b>206</b> and <b>207</b>. The address signal stored in the latch is supplied to the address generator <b>25</b> via the inverters <b>208</b> and <b>209</b>.</p>
    <p>As the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz is subsequently supplied, the incremented internal address signal iAdd supplied from the address generator <b>25</b> (FIG. 3) is latched by a latch comprised of the inverters <b>204</b> and <b>205</b>. The incremented internal address signal iAdd is then stored in the latch made up from the inverters <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> at a timing when the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz becomes HIGH. Until the burst operation is completed, the internal address iAdd from the address generator <b>25</b> is stored in the latch comprised of the inverters <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> in response to the internal-timing-pulse signal.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 is a circuit diagram showing a circuit structure of the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b>.</p>
    <p>The write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b> includes OR circuits <b>511</b>, <b>512</b>, AND circuits <b>513</b>-<b>515</b>, an inverter <b>516</b>, fixed-delay circuits <b>517</b> and <b>518</b> for timing adjustment, and a pulse-width-adjustment unit <b>520</b>.</p>
    <p>The write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b> generates HIGH pulses as the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT and the column-selection pulse csp in synchronism with the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> when the write-enable signal wrtz is HIGH, i.e, when the write operation is engaged. When the write-enable signal wrtz is LOW as in a read operation, the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b> generates a HIGH pulse as the column-selection pulse csp and fixes the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT to a LOW level in synchronism with the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz and the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz.</p>
    <p>When the write-enable signal wrtz is HIGH, one input of the AND circuit <b>513</b> receives a LOW-level signal via the inverter <b>516</b>. Because of this, signals originating from the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz and the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz are blocked by the AND circuit <b>513</b>. Also, the write-enable signal wrtz that is HIGH is supplied to one input of the AND circuit <b>514</b>. The AND circuit <b>514</b> thus permits a passage of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> having a timing thereof adjusted by the fixed-delay circuit <b>518</b>. This data-strobe signal is changed into pulses by the pulse-width-adjustment unit <b>520</b>, and is output as the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT and the column-selection pulse csp. In a sense, the AND circuit <b>514</b> serves to output the signal /DS<b>1</b> which corresponds to a first falling edge of the data-strobe signal DS after the write-enable signal wrtz becomes HIGH. When the write-enable signal wrtz is LOW (i.e., during a read operation), the AND circuit <b>515</b> has one input thereof at a LOW level so as to output a signal fixed to a LOW level as the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT. This deactivates the write amplifiers <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>). Since the AND circuit <b>514</b> has one input thereof at a LOW level, the AND circuit <b>514</b> prevents the passage of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b>. Since one input of the AND circuit <b>513</b> is HIGH because of the LOW level of the write-enable signal wrtz, the AND circuit <b>513</b> outputs the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz or the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz having a timing thereof adjusted by the fixed-delay circuit <b>517</b>. The output from the AND circuit <b>513</b> is subjected to signal-shape adjustment by the pulse-width-adjustment unit <b>520</b>, and is output as the column-selection pulse csp.</p>
    <p>Signal-output timings of the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT and the column-selection pulse csp during the write operation are adjusted by the fixed-delay circuit <b>518</b>. This timing adjustment makes sure that the write amplifiers <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> are activated after the parallel data is output from the shift register <b>15</b> and the data latch <b>16</b> and that the predecoders <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> are activated after an address corresponding to the write data is output from the address generator <b>33</b>.</p>
    <p>A signal-output timing of the column-selection pulse csp during the read operation is adjusted by the fixed-delay circuit <b>517</b>. This adjustment is to insure that the predecoders <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> are activated at such a timing as to meet an address that is output by the address generator <b>33</b> at an earlier timing than in a write operation.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11 is a circuit diagram showing details of inter-connections between the command decoder <b>22</b>, the write-command latch <b>23</b>, the burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b>, the mode register <b>502</b> and the clock generator <b>501</b>.</p>
    <p>The command decoder <b>22</b> receives a command in synchronism with an edge of the internal clock signal iCLK, and decodes the command which is defined as a combination of various control signals such as /CAS, /RAS, /CS, /WE, and the like. When the command Comm is a write command, the command decoder <b>22</b> outputs the write signal wrpz and the CAS signal that are both HIGH. The clock generator <b>501</b> includes a rising-edge-to-pulse conversion circuit <b>531</b> and AND circuits <b>532</b> and <b>533</b>. The rising-edge-to-pulse conversion circuit <b>531</b> outputs the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz that is HIGH when the CAS signal is supplied. The burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b> includes a counter <b>534</b>, an inverter <b>535</b>, and a flip-flop circuit <b>536</b>. The counter <b>534</b> is reset by the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz supplied form the clock generator <b>501</b>. Because of this, a Q output of the flip-flop <b>536</b> (i.e., the burst-end signal endz) becomes HIGH in response to a falling edge of the internal clock signal iCLK. The burst-end signal endz at the HIGH level is supplied to one input of the AND circuit <b>532</b> of the clock generator <b>501</b>, so that the AND circuit <b>532</b> outputs the internal clock signal iCLK without any change as it is supplied to the other input thereof. The AND circuit <b>533</b> receives at one input thereof the CAS signal that is HIGH, and, thus, outputs the internal clock signal iCLK as the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz. The counter <b>534</b> of the burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b> counts pulses of the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz supplied from the clock generator <b>501</b> until the count reaches the burst length set in the mode register <b>502</b>. When the count is completed, the counter <b>534</b> outputs a HIGH level. In response, the burst-end signal endz becomes LOW. The change to LOW in the burst-end signal endz results in the AND gate <b>532</b> blocking the internal clock signal iCLK, thereby stopping the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz from being output.</p>
    <p>The write-command latch <b>23</b> includes a latch <b>538</b> and an inverter <b>537</b>. The write-command latch <b>23</b> outputs the write-enable signal wrtz that is HIGH when the write signal wrpz of a HIGH level is supplied. When the count of the intpnz-signal pulses by the burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b> is completed so as to change the burst-end signal endz to LOW, the write-command latch <b>23</b> resets the write-enable signal wrtz to LOW.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 is a block diagram showing a second embodiment of a semiconductor memory device according to the present invention. In FIG. 12, the same elements as those of FIG. 3 are referred to by the same numerals, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p>A semiconductor memory device <b>50</b> of FIG. 12 includes the data-input buffer <b>11</b>, the data-strobe-input buffer <b>12</b>, the address buffer <b>13</b>, the frequency divider <b>17</b>, the frequency divider <b>18</b>, the command decoder <b>22</b>, the write-command latch <b>23</b>, the address generator <b>25</b>, the address buffer <b>28</b>, the write amplifier <b>29</b>, the write amplifier <b>30</b>, the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b>, the predecoder <b>34</b>, the predecoder <b>35</b>, the odd-numbered-cell array <b>36</b>, the even-numbered-cell array <b>37</b>, the sense amplifier <b>38</b>, the sense amplifier <b>39</b>, the column decoder <b>40</b>, the column decoder <b>41</b>, the burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b>, the read amplifier <b>43</b>, the read amplifier <b>44</b>, the clock generator <b>501</b>, the mode register <b>502</b>, the parallel-to-serial conversion unit <b>503</b>, and the output buffer <b>504</b>, all of which are included in the configuration of FIG. <b>3</b>. The semiconductor memory device <b>50</b> further includes a data latch <b>51</b>, a shift register <b>52</b>, a data latch <b>53</b>, data latch <b>54</b>, a shift register <b>55</b>, a data latch <b>56</b>, a delay circuit <b>57</b>, a latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b>, a latch-output-clock generator <b>59</b>, a internal-clock generator <b>60</b> address latch <b>61</b>, and a shift register <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>In the first embodiment previously described, the address signal is latched in synchronism with the clock signal CLK, and is supplied from the latches to the internal circuit in synchronism with the data-strobe signal DS, thereby matching timings between the address and the data. In the second embodiment, on the other hand, the address signal is kept synchronized with the clock signal CLK, and the data signal latched in synchronism with the data-strobe signal DS is supplied from latches to the internal circuit in synchronism with the clock signal CLK in order to align timings between the address and the data.</p>
    <p>In detail, the address signal Add supplied to the address buffer <b>13</b> is latched by the address latch <b>61</b> at a rising edge of the clock signal CLK. After this, the shift register <b>62</b> delays the address signal Add by 1.5 cycles in time, so that the latched address is supplied to the address buffer <b>28</b> 1.5 cycles after the input of the address signal Add. No matter when the data-strobe signal DS is provided within a time margin between the shortest tDSS and the longest tDSS, the address is delayed by 1.5 cycles. Data-write operations, therefore, start 1.5 cycles after the input of a command (which occurs at a timing of address input).</p>
    <p>In what follows, operations of the semiconductor memory device <b>50</b> will be described with regard to a case in which tDSS is the shortest and a case in which tDSS is the longest.</p>
    <p>FIG. 13 is a timing chart for explaining operations of the semiconductor memory device <b>50</b> in the case of the shortest tDSS. It should be noted that FIG. 13 is provided for the purpose of explanation, and is not intended to show exact details of signal delays introduced by circuit elements.</p>
    <p>With reference to FIGS. 12 and 13, where the shortest tDSS is employed, a write command is input, and an external write address WA<b>1</b> is latched by the address latch <b>61</b> in response to a rising edge (clk<b>1</b>) of the clock signal CLK. Data D<b>0</b> of the data signal DQ is then latched by the data latch <b>51</b> in response to a rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS. Further, a following falling edge of the data-strobe signal DS prompts the data latch <b>53</b> to latch data D<b>1</b>. At the same time, the data D<b>0</b> stored in the data latch <b>51</b> is transferred to the shift register <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>In response to a next rising edge (clk<b>2</b>) of the clock signal CLK, a write address WA<b>2</b> is latched by the address latch <b>61</b>. When this happens, the writes address WA<b>1</b>, which was previously supplied, is transferred to and stored in the shift register <b>62</b>. Data D<b>2</b> of the data signal DQ is then latched by the data latch <b>54</b> in response to a rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS. Further, a following falling edge of the data-strobe signal DS prompts the data latch <b>56</b> to latch data D<b>3</b>. At the same time, the data D<b>2</b> stored in the data latch <b>54</b> is transferred to the shift register <b>55</b>.</p>
    <p>Concurrently with the operations described above, a data-write operation with respect to the write address WA<b>1</b> is started 1.5 cycles after the input of the write address WA<b>1</b> (i.e., at a timing clk<b>2</b>.<b>5</b>). Namely, the write address WA<b>1</b> is supplied from the shift register <b>62</b> to the address buffer <b>28</b>, and the data D<b>0</b> of the shift register <b>52</b> and the data D<b>1</b> of the data latch <b>53</b> are supplied to the write amplifier <b>29</b> and the write amplifier <b>30</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>Following to this, a data-write operation with respect to the write address WA<b>2</b> is started 1.5 cycles after the input of the write address WA<b>2</b> (i.e., at a timing clk<b>3</b>.<b>5</b>). Namely, the write address WA<b>2</b> is supplied from the shift register <b>62</b> to the address buffer <b>28</b>, and the data D<b>2</b> of the shift register <b>55</b> and the data D<b>3</b> of the data latch <b>56</b> are supplied to the write amplifier <b>29</b> and the write amplifier <b>30</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14 is a timing chart for explaining operations of the semiconductor memory device <b>50</b> in the case of the longest tDSS. It should be noted that FIG. 14 is provided for the purpose of explanation, and is not intended to show exact details of signal delays introduced by circuit elements.</p>
    <p>With reference to FIGS. 12 and 14, where the longest tDSS is employed, a write command is input, and an external write address WA<b>1</b> is latched by the address latch <b>61</b> in response to a rising edge (clk<b>1</b>) of the clock signal CLK. Further, responding to a next rising edge (clk<b>2</b>) of the clock signal CLK, the address latch <b>61</b> latches a write address WA<b>2</b>. As the latter latching operation is performed, the write address WA<b>1</b>, which was previously latched, is transferred to and stored in the shift register <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>When the write address WA<b>2</b> is latched by the address latch <b>61</b>, data D<b>0</b> of the data signal DQ is latched by the data latch <b>51</b> in response to a rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS. Further, a following falling edge of the data-strobe signal DS prompts the data latch <b>53</b> to latch data D<b>1</b>. At the same time, the data D<b>0</b> stored in the data latch <b>51</b> is transferred to the shift register <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>Concurrently with the operations described above, a data-write operation with respect to the write address WA<b>1</b> is started 1.5 cycles after the input of the write address WA<b>1</b> (i.e., at a timing clk<b>2</b>.<b>5</b>). Namely, the write address WA<b>1</b> is supplied from the shift register <b>62</b> to the address buffer <b>28</b>, and the data D<b>0</b> of the shift register <b>52</b> and the data D<b>1</b> of the data latch <b>53</b> are supplied to the write amplifier <b>29</b> and the write amplifier <b>30</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>Subsequent to the above operations, data D<b>2</b> of the data signal DQ is latched by the data latch <b>54</b> in response to a rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS. Further, a following falling edge of the data-strobe signal DS prompts the data latch <b>56</b> to latch data D<b>3</b>. At the same time, the data D<b>2</b> stored in the data latch <b>54</b> is transferred to the shift register <b>55</b>.</p>
    <p>A data-write operation with respect to the write address WA<b>2</b> is started 1.5 cycles after the input of the write address WA<b>2</b> (i.e., at a timing clk<b>3</b>.<b>5</b>). Namely, the write address WA<b>2</b> is supplied from the shift register <b>62</b> to the address buffer <b>28</b>, and the data D<b>2</b> of the shift register <b>55</b> and the data D<b>3</b> of the data latch <b>56</b> are supplied to the write amplifier <b>29</b> and the write amplifier <b>30</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>In this manner, the second embodiment of the present invention keeps the address signal in synchronism with the clock signal CLK, and, upon receiving the data signal in synchronism with the data-strobe signal DS, supplies the data signal at appropriate timings synchronized with the clock signal CLK. These timings may be set to an end of a predetermined clock-cycle period starting from the input of a data-write address. This makes it possible to supply the address and the data simultaneously to the internal circuit in synchronism with the clock signal CLK , thereby performing an appropriate data-write operation.</p>
    <p>FIG. 15 is a circuit diagram showing a circuit configuration of the latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>The latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b> of FIG. 15 includes NAND circuits <b>221</b> through <b>229</b>, inverters <b>230</b> through <b>243</b>, and a plurality of capacitors C.</p>
    <p>The data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> supplied from the data-strobe-input buffer <b>12</b> is delayed by a series of delay elements comprised of the inverters <b>230</b> through <b>232</b> and a plurality of the capacitors C. The NAND circuit <b>221</b> and the inverter <b>237</b> perform an AND operation between the delayed and inverted data-strobe signal and the data-strobe signal DS, thereby generating a pulse signal becoming HIGH at rising edges of the data-strobe signal DS. This pulse signal is output as the latch-input clock ds<b>1</b>pz via the NAND circuit <b>228</b> and the inverter <b>242</b> when the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x is HIGH. When the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x is LOW, on the other hand, the pulse signal is output as the latch-input clock ds<b>2</b>pz via the NAND circuit <b>229</b> and the inverter <b>243</b>.</p>
    <p>The frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x becomes HIGH first in response to a first rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. In response to a next rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS, the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x changes to LOW. The latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b> thus outputs ds<b>1</b>pz first, and then outputs ds<b>2</b>pz one clock cycle later in terms of the clock cycles of the data-strobe signal DS.</p>
    <p>The data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> input to the inverter <b>233</b> is delayed by a series of delay elements comprised of the inverters <b>234</b> through <b>236</b> and a plurality of the capacitors C. The NAND circuit <b>222</b> and the inverter <b>238</b> perform an AND operation between an inverse of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> and the delayed data-strobe signal, thereby generating a pulse signal becoming HIGH at falling edges of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b>. This pulse signal is output as the latch-input clock ds<b>1</b>px via the NAND circuit <b>226</b> and the inverter <b>240</b> when the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x is HIGH. When the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x is LOW, on the other hand, the pulse signal is output as the latch-input clock ds<b>2</b>px via the NAND circuit <b>227</b> and the inverter <b>241</b>.</p>
    <p>The frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x becomes HIGH first in response to a first rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. In response to a next rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS, the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x changes to LOW. The latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b> thus outputs ds<b>1</b>px first, and then outputs ds<b>2</b>px one clock cycle later in terms of the clock cycles of the data-strobe signal DS. In this manner, the latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b> outputs pulse signals ds<b>1</b>pz, ds<b>1</b>px, ds<b>2</b>pz, and ds<b>2</b>px successively in this order.</p>
    <p>The latch-input clocks ds<b>1</b>pz and ds<b>2</b>pz generated as described above are supplied to the data latches <b>51</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively In synchronism with the rising edges of the data-strobe signal DS, therefore, odd-number input data (D<b>0</b>, D<b>2</b>) as shown in FIGS. 13 and 14 are latched by the data latches <b>51</b> and <b>54</b> in turn. Further, the latch-input clocks ds<b>1</b>px and ds<b>2</b>px are supplied to the data latches <b>53</b> and <b>56</b>, respectively, so that the even-number input data (D<b>1</b>, D<b>3</b>) as shown in FIGS. 13 and 14 are latched by the data latches <b>53</b> and <b>56</b> in turn in synchronism with the falling edges of the data-strobe signal DS. By the same token, the shift registers <b>52</b> and <b>55</b> store the even-number data in turn in synchronism with the falling edges of the data-strobe signal DS. In this manner, the shift register <b>52</b>, the data latch <b>53</b>, the shift register <b>55</b>, and the data latch <b>56</b> respectively store four pieces of write data D<b>0</b>, D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, and D<b>3</b> successively in this order as these pieces of data are supplied serially.</p>
    <p>FIG. 16 is a circuit diagram showing another configuration of the latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b>. The latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b> of the figure includes frequency dividers <b>541</b>, <b>542</b>, inverters <b>543</b>, <b>544</b>, and AND circuits <b>545</b>-<b>548</b>.</p>
    <p>The frequency divider <b>541</b> divides by half a frequency of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> supplied from the data-strobe-input buffer <b>12</b> to generate the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x when the write-enable signal wrtz is HIGH. The AND circuit <b>545</b> outputs the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> when the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x is HIGH, and supplies a HIGH-level signal ds<b>1</b>pz to the data latch <b>51</b> in response to a first rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b>. The AND circuit <b>546</b> outputs the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> when the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>x is LOW, and supplies a HIGH-level signal ds<b>2</b>pz to the data latch <b>54</b> in response to a next rising edge of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>The frequency divider <b>542</b> divides by half a frequency of the data-strobe signal /DS<b>1</b> supplied from the data-strobe-input buffer <b>12</b> to generate the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>z when the write-enable signal wrtz is HIGH. The AND circuit <b>547</b> outputs the data-strobe signal /DS<b>1</b> when the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>z is HIGH, and supplies a HIGH-level signal ds<b>1</b>px to the shift register <b>52</b> and the data latch <b>53</b> in response to a first falling edge of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b>. The AND circuit <b>548</b> outputs the data-strobe signal /DS<b>1</b> when the frequency-divided-data-strobe signal ds<b>2</b>z is LOW, and supplies a HIGH-level signal ds<b>2</b>px to the shift register <b>55</b> and the data latch <b>56</b> in response to a next falling edge of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>In this manner, the latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b> outputs signals ds<b>1</b>pz, ds<b>1</b>px, ds<b>2</b>pz, and ds<b>2</b>px successively in this order in response to the rising edges and falling edges of the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17 is a circuit diagram showing a circuit structure of the latch-output-clock generator <b>59</b>.</p>
    <p>The latch-output-clock generator <b>59</b> of FIG. 17 includes NAND circuit <b>251</b> through <b>255</b>, inverters <b>256</b> through <b>262</b>, and capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. The internal-clock signal iCLK input to the inverter <b>256</b> is delayed by a series of delay elements comprised of the inverters <b>257</b> through <b>259</b> and the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. The NAND circuit <b>251</b> and the inverter <b>260</b> perform an AND operation between an inverse of the internal-clock signal iCLK and the delayed internal-clock signal, thereby generating a pulse signal becoming HIGH at falling edges of the internal-clock signal iCLK. This pulse signal is output as the latch-output clock clk<b>1</b>z via the NAND circuits <b>253</b> and <b>255</b> when the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is HIGH. When the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is LOW, on the other hand, the pulse signal is output as the latch-output clock clk<b>1</b>x via the NAND circuits <b>252</b> and <b>254</b>.</p>
    <p>In this example, the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z first becomes HIGH and then changes to LOW, so that the latch-output-clock generator <b>59</b> first outputs clk<b>1</b>z and then outputs clk<b>1</b>x. Accordingly, the shift register <b>52</b> and the data latch <b>53</b> outputs the write data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b>, respectively, and, then, the shift register <b>55</b> and the data latch <b>56</b> outputs the next write data D<b>2</b> and D<b>3</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>As described above, the shift register <b>52</b> and the data latch <b>53</b> (or the shift register <b>55</b> and the data latch <b>56</b>) need to output the stored data 1.5 clock cycles after the inputting of a corresponding address. To this end, the second embodiment of the present invention delays the write-enable signal by one clock cycle by using the delay circuit <b>57</b>. This insures that the latch-output-clock generator <b>59</b> does not output clk<b>1</b>z and clk<b>1</b>x at a falling edge of the internal clock signal iCLK 0.5 clock after the address input.</p>
    <p>FIG. 18 is a circuit diagram showing another configuration of the delay circuit <b>57</b>, the frequency divider <b>18</b>, and the latch-output-clock generator <b>59</b>.</p>
    <p>The circuit of FIG. 18 includes a one-clock delay <b>551</b>, a frequency divider <b>552</b>, inverters <b>553</b>, <b>557</b>, and AND circuits <b>554</b> and <b>555</b>. The one-clock delay <b>551</b> is comprised of a DQ flip-flop, and delays the write-enable signal wrtz by one clock cycle, thereby outputting a signal dwrtz. The frequency divider <b>552</b> is activated by the signal dwrtz, and divides a frequency of the internal clock signal iCLK by half to output a frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z. The AND circuit <b>554</b> supplies an inverse of the internal clock signal iCLK as a clk<b>1</b>z signal to the shift register <b>52</b> and the data latch <b>53</b> when the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is HIGH. In other words, the AND circuit <b>554</b> outputs the clk<b>1</b>z signal that is HIGH in response to a falling edge of the internal clock signal iCLK 1.5 clock cycles after the address corresponding to the first data set (D<b>0</b>, D<b>1</b>) is acquired. The AND circuit <b>555</b> supplies an inverse of the internal clock signal iCLK as a clk<b>1</b>x signal to the shift register <b>55</b> and the data latch <b>56</b> when the frequency-divided-clock signal clk<b>2</b>z is LOW. In other words, the AND circuit <b>555</b> outputs the clk<b>1</b>x signal that is HIGH in response to a falling edge of the internal clock signal iCLK 1.5 clock cycles after the address corresponding to the second data set (D<b>2</b>, D<b>3</b>) is acquired. In this manner, the latch-output-clock generator <b>59</b> prompts the shift register <b>52</b> and the data latch <b>53</b> to output the data thereof in parallel at an end of a 1.5-clock-cycle period after the acquisition of the first address, and prompts the shift register <b>55</b> and the data latch <b>56</b> to output the data thereof in parallel at an end of a 1.5-clock-cycle period after the acquisition of the second address.</p>
    <p>The latch-output clock clk<b>1</b>z generated in such a manner is supplied to the shift register <b>52</b> and the data latch <b>53</b>, so that the stored data is output to the internal circuit in synchronism with a falling edge of the clock signal CLK at an end of the 1.5-clock-cycle period from the inputting of the corresponding address. Further, the latch-output clock clk<b>1</b>x is supplied to the shift register <b>55</b> and the data latch <b>56</b>, so that the a falling edge of the clock signal CLK at an end of a 1.5-clock-cycle period from the corresponding address input prompts the outputting of stored data to the internal circuit.</p>
    <p>FIG. 19 is a circuit diagram showing circuit structures of the data latch <b>51</b>, the shift register <b>52</b>, and the data latch <b>53</b>. The data latch <b>54</b>, the shift register <b>55</b>, and the data latch <b>56</b> also have the same circuit structures as these shown in the figure.</p>
    <p>The circuit of FIG. 19 includes inverters <b>271</b> through <b>282</b> and transfer gates <b>283</b> through <b>287</b>. Each of the transfer gates <b>283</b> through <b>287</b> is comprised of a PMOS transistor and an NMOS transistor. The inverters <b>273</b> and <b>274</b> together make up a latch portion corresponding to the data latch <b>51</b>, and the inverters <b>276</b> and <b>277</b> together form a latch corresponding to the shift register <b>52</b>. Further, the inverters <b>280</b> and <b>281</b> together make up a latch portion corresponding to the data latch <b>53</b>.</p>
    <p>Such circuit configuration as shown in FIG. 19 implements operations in which the data latch <b>51</b> stores odd-number data (D<b>0</b>) in response to the latch-input pulse ds<b>1</b>pz, and the data latch <b>53</b> stores the even-number data (D<b>1</b>) in response to the latch-input pulse ds<b>1</b>px, while the latch-input pulse also prompts the shift register <b>52</b> to store the odd-number data transferred from the data latch <b>51</b>. Further, the latch-output pulse clk<b>1</b>z is used for outputting the data to the internal circuit at an appropriate timing, i.e, outputting the data in response to a falling edge of the clock signal CLK at an end of a 1.5-clock-cycle period after the acquisition of the corresponding address.</p>
    <p>FIG. 20 is a circuit diagram showing a relevant portion of the internal-clock generator <b>60</b> which generates timing signals clk<b>3</b>az and clk<b>3</b>x used for control of the 1.5-clock-cycle delay.</p>
    <p>The circuit of FIG. 20 includes NAND circuit <b>301</b> and <b>302</b>, inverters <b>303</b> through <b>311</b>, and a plurality of capacitors C.</p>
    <p>The internal clock signal iCLK is delayed by a series of delay elements comprised of the inverters <b>303</b> through <b>305</b> and a plurality of the capacitors C. The NAND circuit <b>301</b> and the inverter <b>306</b> performs an AND operation between the delayed and inverted internal clock signal and the internal clock signal iCLK, thereby producing a pulse signal becoming HIGH at rising edges of the internal clock signal iCLK. This pulse signal is output as the timing signal clk<b>3</b>z.</p>
    <p>The internal clock signal iCLK input to the inverter <b>307</b> is delayed by a series of delay elements comprised of the inverters <b>308</b> through <b>310</b> and a plurality of the capacitors C. The NAND circuit <b>302</b> and the inverter <b>311</b> performs an AND operation between an inverse of the internal clock signal iCLK and the delayed internal clock signal, thereby producing a pulse signal becoming HIGH at falling edges of the internal clock signal iCLK. This pulse signal is output as the timing signal clk<b>3</b>x. When the write-enable signal wrtz is LOW, both of the timing signals clk<b>3</b>z and clk<b>3</b>x are LOW. These signals clk<b>3</b>z and clk<b>3</b>x are supplied to the shift register <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 21 is a circuit diagram showing circuit structures of the address latch <b>61</b>, the shift register <b>62</b>, and the address buffer <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>The circuit of FIG. 21 includes inverters <b>321</b> through <b>337</b> and transfer gates <b>338</b> through <b>343</b> and <b>345</b>. Each of the transfer gates <b>338</b> through <b>343</b> and <b>345</b> is comprised of a PMOS transistor and an NMOS transistor. The inverters <b>323</b> and <b>324</b> together make up a latch portion corresponding to the address latch <b>61</b>. Further, a latch comprised of the inverters <b>326</b> and <b>327</b> and a latch formed by the inverters <b>329</b> and <b>330</b> together form a circuit portion corresponding to the shift register <b>62</b>. Further, the inverters <b>332</b> and <b>333</b> together make up a latch portion corresponding to the address buffer <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>When the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz becomes HIGH, the transfer gate <b>338</b> opens, so that the latch comprised of the inverters <b>323</b> and <b>324</b> latches the external address signal Add. In response to an immediately following falling edge of the clock signal CLK, the timing signal clk<b>3</b>x becomes HIGH, so that the address signal is stored in the latch comprised of the inverters <b>326</b> and <b>327</b>. Then, the latch comprised of the inverters <b>329</b> and <b>330</b> latches the address signal when a subsequent rising edge of the clock signal CLK is supplied. Finally, in response to a following falling edge of the clock signal CLK, the address data stored in the latch is supplied to the address buffer <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>When the internal address iAdd is to be stored in the address latch <b>61</b> in a burst-write operation, the internal-timing-pulse signal intpnz instead of the external-timing-pulse signal extpnz becomes HIGH. The subsequent operations of the shift register <b>62</b> are the same as described above.</p>
    <p>The internal address iAdd is generated by the address generator <b>25</b> (FIG. <b>12</b>). The address generator <b>25</b> adds <b>1</b> to an address supplied from the address latch <b>61</b> so as to generate the internal address iAdd.</p>
    <p>In this manner, the shift register <b>62</b> introduces a delay equivalent to 1.5 cycles of the clock signal CLK. During a read operation, the write-enable signal wrtz becomes LOW, so that the address latched by the address latch <b>61</b> is supplied to the address buffer <b>28</b> via the transfer gate <b>345</b> without incurring an unnecessary delay in the shift register <b>62</b>. That is, only a minimum time period passes from the input of the read command before the output becomes available. In this case, the clk<b>3</b>x and clk<b>3</b>z signals are LOW, thereby preventing the address signal from passing through the normal path of the shift register <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 22 is a circuit diagram showing a circuit structure of the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator.</p>
    <p>This circuit includes OR circuits <b>611</b>, <b>612</b>, AND circuits <b>613</b>, <b>614</b>, <b>615</b>, inverters <b>616</b>, <b>621</b>, fixed delays <b>617</b> and <b>618</b> for timing adjustment, one-clock delay <b>619</b>, and a pulse-width adjustment unit <b>620</b>. A circuit configuration of this circuit is basically the same as that of the first embodiment shown in FIG. <b>10</b>. However, the circuit of FIG. 10 has the fixed delay <b>518</b> receiving the data-strobe signal DS<b>1</b> while the circuit of FIG. 22 has the fixed-delay circuit <b>618</b> which receives the internal clock signal iCLK. Because of this difference, the circuit of FIG. 22 outputs the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT and the column-selection pulse csp in synchronism with the internal clock signal iCLK during the write operation (wrtz: H) whereas operations of the read operation (wrtz: L) are identical between the two circuits.</p>
    <p>Another difference is that the circuit of FIG. 22 is provided with the one-clock delay <b>619</b>. As is apparent from FIGS. 4 and 5, the first write data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are not written in the internal circuit until at least 1.5 clock cycles after the inputting of the corresponding write command regardless of whether tDSS is the shortest or the longest. The one-clock delay <b>619</b> is provided in order to insure that the write-amplifier-activation signal WRT and the column-selection pulse csp are not generated prior to a timing of the falling edge of the internal clock signal iCLK that corresponds to an end of the 1.5-cycle period.</p>
    <p>In the first embodiment previously described, two address latches (latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>) are provided, whereas the second embodiment is provided with two sets of data latches. The number of these latches or the number of these data latches is not limited to two, but, as is apparent from the disclosure, may be more than two depending on the length of the longest tDSS.</p>
    <p>In the following, third and fourth embodiments will be described.</p>
    <p>In the first embodiment, two latches (i.e., the latches <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>) are provided for the purpose of latching addresses. Because of this, the case of the shortest tDDS as shown in FIG. <b>1</b> and the case of the longest tDDS as shown in FIG. 2 are properly dealt with. When the two bits (D<b>0</b>, D<b>1</b>) of the first data is supplied to the internal circuit, it is sufficient in the case of FIG. 1 to have a latch that stores a single address corresponding to the two-bit data. In the case of FIG. 2, however, there is a need to have latches which store two addresses including a first address for the first two-bit data and a second address for second two-bit data. If only one latch is provided, the case of FIG. 2 cannot be handled. Namely, the address for the first two-bit data is rewritten by the address for the next data as the first two-bit data is transferred to the internal circuit, so that writing of data in specified memory cells cannot be achieved. Further, when the address latches are implemented via shift registers such as the address latches <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> of FIG. 12, such a configuration cannot cope with the case of FIG. <b>1</b>. These shift registers perform a data-shift operation while holding a plurality of consecutive addresses (two addresses in this example). Because of this, an address cannot be output to the internal circuit for at least one clock cycle after the acquisition of the address. Namely, when the first two-bit data is transferred to the internal circuit, a corresponding address cannot be output from the shift register to the internal circuit.</p>
    <p>The second embodiment is provided with two parallel sets of data latches (<b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>; <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>) (see FIG. <b>12</b>). This configuration is necessary in order to cope with a case (FIG. 13) in which two sets of data must remain intact in the storage when the first two-bit data is transferred to the internal circuit and a case (FIG. 14) in which only one set of data needs to be kept in the storage.</p>
    <p>In the examples of FIGS. 1 and 2 (or FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>), a description was given with respect to a case in which the margin of the time period tDSS is equivalent to one clock cycle.</p>
    <p>FIG. 23 is a timing chart for explaining timing relations between the clock signal, the data-strobe signal, and the data-write timings when the time period tDSS has a narrower margin (e.g, equivalent to half the clock cycle).</p>
    <p>As is shown in the example of FIG. 23, the address buffers must keep two addresses stored therein including an address for first two-bit data and an address for next two-bit data when the first two-bit data (D<b>0</b>, D<b>1</b>) is transferred to the internal circuit in parallel. In the example of FIG. 23, there is only one pattern of timing relations as to how the addresses are acquired. Because of this, a configuration based on the address latch <b>61</b> plus the shift register <b>62</b> as described in connection with FIG. 12 can be employed as an address-buffer configuration in place of the configuration using the latch <b>26</b> plus the latch <b>27</b> as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. It should be noted, however, that the shift register <b>62</b> of FIG. 12 delays an address signal by 1.5 clock cycles whereas the shift register in the third embodiment delays an address signal only by one clock cycle.</p>
    <p>FIG. 24 is a block diagram of the third embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 24, the same elements as those of FIG. 3 are referred to by the sane numerals, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p>A semiconductor device <b>630</b> of FIG. 24 includes the data-input buffer <b>11</b>, the data latch <b>14</b>, the shift register <b>15</b>, the data latch <b>16</b>, the write amplifiers <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, the odd-numbered-cell array <b>36</b>, the even-numbered-cell array <b>37</b>, the sense amplifiers <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, the column decoders <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, the read amplifiers <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, the parallel-to-serial conversion unit <b>503</b>, the output buffer <b>504</b>, the data-strobe-input buffer <b>12</b>, the command decoder <b>22</b>, the write-command latch <b>23</b>, the mode register <b>502</b>, the burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b>, the clock generator <b>501</b>, the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b>, the address buffer <b>13</b>, and the predecoders <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>.</p>
    <p>The semiconductor device of FIG. 24 does not includes the increment latch <b>24</b>, the address generator <b>25</b>, the latches <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, the address buffer <b>28</b>, the address generator <b>33</b>, the internal-clock generator <b>21</b>, the frequency dividers <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, the latch-input-clock generator <b>20</b>, and the latch-output-clock generator <b>19</b>, all of which are shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. Instead, the semiconductor device of FIG. 24 includes an internal-clock generator <b>632</b> and an address generator <b>631</b>.</p>
    <p>The internal-clock generator <b>632</b> has the same configuration as the internal-clock generator <b>60</b> of FIG. 12, and the address generator <b>631</b> has a configuration that combines the address latch <b>61</b>, the shift register <b>62</b>, the address generator <b>25</b>, and the address buffer <b>28</b> of FIG. <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>With regard to the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator of FIG. 24, the AND circuit <b>514</b> of FIG. 10 has one input thereof directly connected to the write-enable signal wrtz. Instead of this configuration, this input of the AND circuit <b>514</b> may be connected to the write-enable signal wrtz via such a one-clock delay as the one-clock delay <b>619</b> of FIG. <b>22</b>. In the third embodiment, the first two-bit data D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are not supplied to the internal circuit until at least one clock cycle after the inputting of the corresponding write command regardless of the time period tDSS. It is desirable, therefore, to provide a one-clock-delay circuit in order to insure that a write pulse/column-selection pulse is not generated by accident due to noise in the data-strobe signal DS or the like within one clock cycle from the inputting of the write command.</p>
    <p>In this manner, the third embodiment has a simpler structure than the first embodiment.</p>
    <p>FIG. 25 is a block diagram of the fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The second embodiment of FIG. 12 is provided with the two sets of data latches so as to satisfy such timing conditions as required in the case of FIG. <b>13</b> and the case of FIG. <b>14</b>. When the tolerable margin of the time period tDSS is narrower than that of the second embodiment, there is a case in which it is sufficient for the data latches to hold only the first two-bit data at a moment when a corresponding address is output to the internal circuit 1.5 clock cycles after the acquisition of this address as shown in FIG. 14 regardless of where the actual time period tDSS is located within the tolerable margin. In such a case, one set of data latches (<b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>) as in FIG. 3 may be used in place of the two sets of data latches (<b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>; <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>) as shown in FIG. <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 25, the same elements as those of FIG. 12 are referred to by the same numerals, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p>A semiconductor device <b>640</b> of FIG. 25 includes the data-input buffer <b>11</b>, the write amplifiers <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, the odd-numbered-cell array <b>36</b>, the even-numbered-cell array <b>37</b>, the sense amplifiers <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, the column decoders <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, the read amplifiers <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, the parallel-to-serial conversion unit <b>503</b>, the output buffer <b>504</b>, the data-strobe-input buffer <b>12</b>, the command decoder <b>22</b>, the write-command latch <b>23</b>, the mode register <b>502</b>, the burst-length-measurement counter <b>42</b>, the clock generator <b>501</b>, the write-pulse/column-selection-pulse generator <b>31</b>, the address buffer <b>13</b>, the predecoders <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, and the internal-clock generator <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>The semiconductor device <b>640</b> of FIG. 25 does not include the data latch <b>51</b>, the shift register <b>52</b>, the data latch <b>53</b>, the data latch <b>54</b>, the shift register <b>55</b>, the data latch <b>56</b>, the delay circuit <b>57</b>, the frequency dividers <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, the latch-input-clock generator <b>58</b>, and the latch-output-clock generator <b>59</b>, all of which are shown in FIG. <b>12</b>. Instead, the semiconductor device <b>640</b> includes a serial-to-parallel conversion unit <b>641</b> comprised of a data latch <b>642</b>, a shift register <b>643</b>, and a data latch <b>644</b>. The serial-to-parallel conversion unit <b>641</b> has the same configuration as the serial-to-parallel conversion unit <b>505</b> of the first embodiment shown in FIG. 3 In this manner, the semiconductor memory device of the fourth embodiment has a simpler structure than does the second embodiment. In the fourth embodiment, just as in the second embodiment, addresses are acquired in synchronism with the clock signal, and data are acquired in synchronism with the data-strobe signal different from the clock signal, yet the internal circuit of the semiconductor device processes both the address and the data in synchronism with the clock signal.</p>
    <p>Further, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, but various variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The present application is based on Japanese priority application No.10-022257 filed on Feb. 3, 1998, with Japanese Patent Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
