<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)</heading> <p num="P-00002">None.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="P-00003">The present invention relates to a rotational control apparatus and more particularly to an eddy current fan drive system operable to drive a cooling fan with multiple speed control.</p>
  <p num="P-00004">In a typical eddy current drive, a first magnetic field producing drive component, such as in the form of permanent magnets, is mounted for rotation with either the input or output of a rotational control apparatus, such as a clutch, for magnetically coupling with a second coupling drive component mounted for rotation with either the input or output. The second coupling drive component was typically in the form of a first ring formed of electrically conductive material, such as copper, sandwiching a second ring of magnetic flux conductive material, such as steel, against a mounting body portion formed of heat conductive material, such as aluminum, so that the body portion acts as a heat sink. Screws extend through the first and second rings and are threaded into the body portion.</p>
  <p num="P-00005">These coupling drive components suffered from various problems and deficiencies. The mechanical attachment of the steel and copper rings to the body portion increases the number of components and assembly required and is subject to loosening and/or separating and thereby detrimentally affecting reliability. Also, the first and second drive components are bearing mounted and fixed close to a fan. The first and second drive components are axially arranged face to face with a fixed gap; there is no relative axial movement between the drive components. Such an arrangement provides two speed fan drives. Current two speed cooling fan customers require more drive torque to rotate larger fans and to rotate fans at higher speeds. Current eddy current drive systems used to operate cooling fans do not have the torque capacity to handle these applications.</p>
  <p num="P-00006">Fan drives exist that can handle the torque required by larger fan applications, however, these fan drives do not include a desired second intermediate speed. One fan clutch that has a large torque capacity is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,092,638, entitled “Splineless Rotational Control Apparatus” and assigned to Horton, Inc. (the assignee of the present application).</p>
  <p num="P-00007">The fan clutch includes an actuation system to apply an axial load on a coupling element. The actuation system is generally constituted of either one of the rotatable components or a separate part, to create some relative axial movement between the coupling elements and fan mounted friction disc (FMFD) (one of the rotatable components) to drivingly interconnect the two rotatable components. Typically, the coupling element is an annular piston which is acted upon by at least one spring to bias the piston toward an activated or a deactivated position and move the FMFD.</p>
  <p num="P-00008">In a typical axially arranged eddy current fan drive there is a fixed gap because the two assemblies that create the eddy current coupling are bearing mounted and fixed to the journal shaft. The eddy current drive may be adapted to a large torque capacity fan clutch to allow relative axial movement between the two assemblies. In the axially actuated fan clutch the magnet poles of the eddy current assembly lie along a line parallel to the central axis and located at a fixed radial distance from the axis. The eddy current assembly includes a non-magnetic material with an axially adjacent magnetic material which is axially spaced from the magnets by an air gap. The air gap between the two assemblies is not fixed because the FMFD moves axially and the two eddy current coupling assemblies move axially relative to one another. Thus, an eddy current coupling is needed that maintains a constant gap while allowing axial relative movement between the two assemblies.</p>
  <p num="P-00009">The axially actuated fan clutch is used to selectively control the transmission of rotational forces between first and second relatively rotatable members, and in particular to a frictional clutching device for driving a fan. The axially actuated fan clutch can handle the drive torque necessary to rotate larger fans and to rotate fans at higher speeds. However, the axially actuated fan clutch typically are one speed and drive the fan between an on and off position.</p>
  <p num="P-00010">Eddy current drives typically produce torque producing eddy currents and non-torque producing eddy currents. When a non-torque producing eddy current is created (an eddy current which does not transmit torque) it is a loss, an inefficiency, and a source of increased heat within the drive. Eddy current drives utilizing a solid-iron back iron as the magnetic material produce the non-torque producing eddy currents. The elimination of non-torque producing eddy currents increases the inefficiency of the eddy current drive.</p>
  <p num="P-00011">Thus, an eddy current drive is needed that eliminates the non-torque producing eddy currents, enhances the production of torque producing eddy currents (torque producing eddy currents which are desired to improve the torque capacity of the fan drive and operate the fan at higher speeds), and can handle the torque required to rotate larger fans, to rotate fans at higher speeds and to permit multiple, but fixed, speed operation.</p>
  <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="P-00012">The present invention relates to a rotational control apparatus including a first rotatable assembly and a second rotatable assembly. The first assembly is rotatably mounted to a first shaft of a first support mount. The second assembly is rotatably mounted to the first assembly, wherein the second assembly is axially moveable relative to the first assembly. The first and second assemblies have respective coaxial surfaces adjacent to and spaced from one another. The first and second assemblies further have respective axial surfaces that frictionally engage one another when the second assembly is in a first axial position and disengage when the second assembly is in a second axial position. The second assembly is capable of rotation independent of the first assembly when the second assembly is in the second axial position. The rotational control apparatus includes an eddy current drive comprised of a first eddy current coupling assembly and a second eddy current coupling assembly. The first eddy current coupling assembly is associated with the coaxial surface of the first assembly and the second eddy current coupling assembly is associated with the coaxial surface of the second assembly wherein the second eddy current coupling assembly is adjacent the first eddy current assembly with an air gap therebetween.</p>
  <p num="P-00013">In a further embodiment of the present invention, the second eddy current coupling assembly includes a plurality of coaxial electrically insulated rings arranged in an inner cavity of the second assembly and a non-magnetic ring coaxially positioned adjacent to the electrically insulated rings.</p>
  <p num="P-00014">Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a rotational control apparatus including a support mount adapted to be maintained in the position fixed against rotation. A first rotatable assembly includes a first portion adapted to be interconnected to a driving source and a second portion axially spaced from the first portion, the second portion further including an outer circumferential surface. A first bearing unit is interposed between the support mount and the first rotatable assembly, with the first rotatable assembly being rotatably supported by the support mount through the first bearing unit. A first engagement surface is provided at the second portion of the first rotatable assembly for concurrent rotation with the first rotatable assembly. The rotational control apparatus includes a second rotatable assembly having first and second sections. The first section of the second rotatable assembly includes a radially extending portion defining an inner radial surface portion aligned with the outer circumferential surface of the first assembly and the inner radial surface portion defining an inner cavity of the second rotatable assembly. The second section of the second rotatable assembly extends radially inwardly from the first section and is axially spaced from the first portion of the first rotatable assembly. A second engagement surface is provided at the first section of the second rotatable assembly. A piston is positioned axially between the first portion of the first rotatable assembly and the second section of the second rotatable assembly, with the piston being axially moveable relative to the first rotatable assembly. The rotational control apparatus includes means for axially moving the piston relative to the first rotatable assembly to cause selective engagement between the first and second engagement surfaces in order to interconnect the first and second rotatable assemblies. A second bearing unit interconnects the piston and the second rotatable assembly for concurrent axial movement relative to the first rotatable assembly, permitting relative rotation between the piston and the second rotatable assembly. A first eddy current assembly is radially mounted to the outer radial surface portion of the second portion of the first rotatable assembly and a second eddy current assembly is radially mounted in the inner cavity of the second rotatable assembly. The second eddy current assembly is radially spaced from and coaxial to the first eddy current assembly. The second eddy current assembly includes a plurality of electrically insulated rings of material radially arranged in the inner cavity of the second rotatable assembly and an intermediate ring of non-magnetic material connected to one of the electrically insulated rings, the intermediate ring positioned between the plurality of electrically insulated rings and the first eddy current assembly.</p>

In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, rotational control apparatus <b>10</b> incorporates a cap member <b>48</b> which extends across first inner circumferential surface <b>42</b>. Cap member <b>48</b> also abuts the outer race of first bearing unit <b>30</b> and is maintained axially by means of a retaining ring <b>50</b>. A seal <b>52</b> is interposed between cap member <b>48</b> and first inner circumferential surface <b>42</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>. At the center of cap member <b>48</b>, a coupling <b>54</b> is secured, which has a fluid passage <b>55</b> therethrough. The passage <b>55</b> of coupling <b>54</b> is in fluid communication with a conduit <b>56</b> of a rotary joint <b>58</b>. Rotary joint <b>58</b> is mounted within a bore <b>60</b> formed in journal shaft <b>18</b> of support mount <b>12</b>, and has an axial face <b>59</b>A engaging an axial face <b>59</b>B of the coupling <b>54</b> to define a rotary union therebetween. In general, rotary joint <b>58</b> takes the form of a cartridge that is known in the art. Conduit <b>56</b> is in further fluid communication with a passage <b>62</b> formed in journal shaft <b>18</b>. Therefore, with this arrangement, a supply of pressurized fluid can be forced to selectively flow into journal shaft <b>18</b> and through cap member <b>48</b> via passage <b>62</b>, conduit <b>56</b> and passage <b>55</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00027">During the initial assembly of rotational control apparatus <b>10</b>, first bearing unit <b>30</b> is initially positioned against shoulder <b>38</b> within first portion <b>22</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>. Thereafter, first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> and first bearing unit <b>30</b> are slid axially onto journal shaft <b>18</b> of support mount <b>12</b> until first bearing unit <b>30</b> abuts shoulder <b>32</b>. Rotary joint <b>58</b> is installed before or after the assembly of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> and first bearing unit <b>30</b> upon support mount <b>12</b>. Retainer element <b>34</b> is threaded onto the inner axial end <b>36</b> of the journal shaft <b>18</b>. With seal <b>52</b> and coupling <b>54</b> attached to cap member <b>48</b>, cap member <b>48</b> is slid along first inner circumferential surface <b>42</b> and pressed against the outer race of first bearing unit <b>30</b>. Thereafter, retaining ring <b>50</b> is mounted in an annular groove formed in first inner circumferential surface <b>42</b> to axially retain cap member <b>48</b>. With this arrangement, support mount <b>12</b> can be advantageously formed of one piece to enhance the structural characteristics thereof while still having journal shaft <b>18</b> extend well into first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, the fluid passage <b>55</b> of coupling <b>54</b> is threaded for receipt of a bolt or the like to allow removal of cap member <b>48</b> (after removal of retaining ring <b>50</b>) for disassembly.</p>
  <p num="P-00028">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, retainer element <b>34</b> is formed with a weep hole <b>64</b> and journal shaft <b>18</b> is provided with a weep passage <b>66</b> that extends from weep hole <b>64</b> axially through support mount <b>12</b>. With this construction, if any leakage of pressurized fluid occurs at the rotary union between coupling <b>54</b> and rotary joint <b>58</b>, the fluid will escape through the weep circuit (weep hole <b>64</b> and weep passage <b>66</b>) and not through first bearing unit <b>30</b>, thereby extending the useful life of bearing unit <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00029">Rotational control apparatus <b>10</b> further includes a piston <b>68</b> having a disc-shaped portion defined, at least in part, by a first axial side surface <b>70</b> that is exposed to the pressurized fluid flowing through coupling <b>54</b>. Piston <b>68</b> also includes a second axial side surface <b>72</b> from which project outer and inner axially extending portions <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. A seal <b>78</b> is interposed between outer axially extending portion <b>74</b> and second inner circumferential surface <b>44</b> of second portion <b>24</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>. A fluid chamber <b>80</b> is defined between first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>, cap member <b>48</b>, and first axial side surface <b>70</b> of piston <b>68</b>. The first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> is preferably formed of a low porosity metal such as steel or iron. As will be detailed further below, piston <b>68</b> is adapted to be selectively moved axially relative to first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> in order to engage and disengage rotational control apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00030">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, seal <b>78</b> is fixed to second portion <b>24</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>. More specifically, an axially extending annular projection <b>82</b> of a reaction plate <b>84</b> captures seal <b>78</b> between first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> and reaction plate <b>84</b>. Piston <b>68</b> is slidable along axial surfaces of projection <b>82</b>, seal <b>78</b> and second portion <b>24</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00031">Reaction plate <b>84</b> includes an outermost circumferential flange portion <b>86</b> that is adapted to be secured to second portion <b>24</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>. Reaction plate <b>84</b> defines first engagement surface <b>46</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>, which may be defined by a frictional lining comprised of a separate material. Reaction plate <b>84</b> also includes an inner, axially extending, annular portion <b>88</b> which aids in defining a plurality of annularly and axially extending cavities <b>92</b> in reaction plate <b>84</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, twelve such cavities <b>92</b> are equally, annularly spaced in reaction plate <b>84</b> and the walls of cavities <b>92</b> define ribs (not shown), which structurally reinforce reaction plate <b>94</b>. Each of the cavities <b>92</b> is adapted to receive a compression spring <b>94</b> which extends between reaction plate <b>84</b>, its respective cavity floor <b>93</b> and second axial side surface <b>72</b> of piston <b>68</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00032">Due to the presence of springs <b>94</b>, piston <b>68</b> is biased proximally towards journal shaft <b>18</b>, but fluid pressure delivered into fluid chamber <b>80</b> can cause piston <b>68</b> to move distally away from the journal shaft <b>18</b> and first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>, against the biasing force of springs <b>94</b>. During this axial movement, piston <b>68</b> also moves axially relative to reaction plate <b>84</b>, with inner axially extending portion <b>76</b> of piston <b>68</b> being guided along inner axially extending portion <b>88</b> of reaction plate <b>84</b>. Inner axially extending portion <b>76</b> of piston <b>68</b> is provided with seals <b>90</b>, which contain lubricant to lubricate the interface between inner axially extending portion <b>76</b> of piston <b>68</b> and annular portion <b>88</b> of reaction plate <b>84</b> and prevent dust from entering that interface. In one form of the invention, an interface <b>95</b> between piston <b>68</b> and reaction plate <b>84</b> is provided with a friction reducing, thermal, spray applied, ceramic/metallic coating which is TEFLON impregnated.</p>
  <p num="P-00033">Rotational control apparatus <b>10</b> also includes a second rotatable assembly <b>96</b>, also known as a fan mounted friction disc (FMFD). Second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> is rotatably mounted to piston <b>68</b>. FMFD <b>96</b> has a first, outer radial section <b>98</b> which is connected to a second, inner radial section <b>100</b>. First outer radial section <b>98</b> has associated therewith a second engagement surface <b>102</b>, which may be defined by a wear coating comprised of a separate material. Second engagement surface <b>102</b> is juxtaposed to first engagement surface <b>46</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>. Outer radial section <b>98</b> is comprised of a first radial portion <b>98</b>A and a second radial portion <b>98</b>B. Second engagement surface <b>102</b> is integral to FMFD <b>96</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00034">FMFD <b>96</b> is preferably formed of aluminum so as to be light-weight and easy to fabricate and machine, as well as for low inertia, low overall weight, and to be non-magnetic. Piston <b>68</b> and reaction plate <b>84</b> are also preferably formed of a light-weight non-magnetic material, such as aluminum.</p>
  <p num="P-00035">Second radial portion <b>98</b>B of FMFD <b>96</b> has an outer radial portion <b>104</b> and an inner radial portion <b>106</b>. Outer radial portion <b>104</b> of second radial portion <b>98</b>B includes a plurality of cooling fins <b>108</b> which disperse heat generated by rotational control apparatus <b>10</b> during operation. The outer and inner radial portions <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> of second radial portion <b>98</b>B define an inner annular cavity <b>110</b> therebetween. Inner surface <b>106</b>A of inner radial portion <b>106</b> of FMFD <b>96</b> is juxtaposed in position adjacent to outer circumferential surface <b>28</b> of second portion <b>24</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>, such that outer circumferential surface <b>28</b> and inner surface <b>106</b>A are radially aligned with a gap <b>114</b> therebetween. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first and second friction engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> are adapted to abut one another when rotational control apparatus <b>10</b> is in an engaged position (i.e., chamber <b>80</b> is not pressurized and piston <b>68</b> has not been moved), thereby frictionally engaging first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> and second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> for coupled rotation.</p>
  <p num="P-00036">FMFD <b>96</b> is adapted to be mounted to piston <b>68</b> through the use of a shaft <b>116</b> having a head portion <b>118</b>. More specifically, shaft <b>116</b> is constituted by a jack bolt having a torque fitting and is adapted to be received within a mounting hub <b>120</b> defined at a central portion of inner radial section <b>100</b> of FMFD <b>96</b>. Mounting hub <b>120</b> is also provided with a shoulder <b>122</b> against which is positioned an inner race of a second bearing unit <b>124</b>. Second bearing unit <b>124</b> has an outer race which is press fit against a thermal expansion controlling insert <b>126</b> cast integral with piston <b>68</b> (i.e., insert <b>126</b> defines inner axially extending portion <b>76</b>) and abuts piston <b>68</b> in one axial direction, with the outer race being retained in its desired position by means of a snap ring <b>128</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00037">During a subsequent stage of assembly of rotational control apparatus <b>10</b>, piston <b>68</b> is inserted into second portion <b>24</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> and reaction plate <b>84</b>, with springs <b>94</b> positioned within cavities <b>92</b>, is secured to first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>. With shaft <b>116</b> extending through second bearing unit <b>124</b>, second bearing unit <b>124</b> is press fit within insert <b>126</b> and abuts piston <b>68</b>. Thereafter, snap ring <b>128</b> is inserted to axially maintain the outer race of second bearing unit <b>124</b>. Mainly due to the construction of reaction plate <b>84</b>, it should be realized that second bearing unit <b>124</b> could be attached to piston <b>68</b> prior to the insertion of piston <b>68</b> within first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> as well. Next, mounting hub <b>120</b> is connected to second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> and is inserted within second bearing unit <b>124</b>. Thereafter, torque is applied to shaft <b>116</b> to rotate the same and draw second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> into second bearing unit <b>124</b> until shoulder <b>122</b> abuts the inner race of second bearing unit <b>124</b>. In tightening shaft <b>116</b> in mounting hub <b>120</b>, head portion <b>118</b> engages the inner race of second bearing unit <b>124</b> such that the inner race is retained between head portion <b>118</b> and shoulder <b>122</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00038">Due to this mounting arrangement and the presence of second bearing unit <b>124</b>, piston <b>68</b> and second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> are permitted to rotate relative to one another. In addition, since second bearing unit <b>124</b> is located at an inner radial location, contaminants and dust will tend to flow radially outwardly and away from second bearing unit <b>124</b> due to centrifugal forces created during operation of rotational control apparatus <b>10</b>. Also provided on second rotatable assembly <b>96</b>, at inner radial section <b>100</b>, are a plurality of annularly spaced shafts or studs <b>130</b> which are fixed to second rotatable assembly <b>96</b>. Since rotational control apparatus <b>10</b>, in the most preferred form of the invention, constitutes a frictional fan clutch, shafts <b>130</b> are adapted to receive a fan blade ring <b>131</b> with fan blades <b>131</b>A thereon (shown in phantom in FIG. <b>1</b>A).</p>
  <p num="P-00039">When used as a clutch wherein both the first rotatable assembly <b>10</b> and second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> are permitted to rotate, springs <b>94</b> bias piston <b>68</b> into a position which causes engagement between first and second frictional engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> (shown in FIG. <b>2</b>). However, pressurized fluid can be introduced within fluid chamber <b>80</b> to cause axial movement of piston <b>68</b>. Due to the interengagement between piston <b>68</b> and second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> through second bearing unit <b>124</b>, axial movement of piston <b>68</b> relative to first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> will cause concurrent axial movement of second rotatable assembly <b>96</b>. This axial movement of second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> will cause disengagement between first and second frictional engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b>, thereby disengaging the frictional clutching operation of rotational control apparatus <b>10</b> (shown in FIG. <b>3</b>).</p>
  <p num="P-00040">It should be noted that first axial side surface <b>70</b> of piston <b>68</b> is disc-shaped, i.e., non-planar. This construction establishes a large piston area which is acted upon by the pressurized fluid introduced into fluid chamber <b>80</b>. Therefore, the large piston area enables a high disengagement force to be developed within rotational control apparatus <b>10</b> for a given fluid pressure, while also allowing a large amount of spring force to cause rapid engagement with reduced slipping and wear.</p>
  <p num="P-00041">When first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> and second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> are engaged, the transfer of rotational forces from one to the other occurs at the outer radial portions of rotational control apparatus <b>10</b>. More specifically, these forces are directly transferred between first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> and second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> through first and second frictional engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00042">The present invention incorporates an eddy current drive system <b>132</b> to drive second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> at an intermediate speed when the piston <b>68</b> is in a second, disengaged position, i.e. when first and second engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> are disengaged. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic illustration of a section view of rotational control apparatus <b>10</b>, and in particular, eddy current drive system <b>132</b>. For clarity of illustration, central portion of the control apparatus <b>10</b> are not shown in FIG. <b>1</b>B. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partial, cross sectional view of rotational control apparatus <b>10</b> in the first, engaged position, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partial, cross-sectional view of rotational control apparatus <b>10</b> in the second, disengaged position.</p>
  <p num="P-00043">Eddy current drive system <b>132</b> is comprised of a first eddy current coupling assembly <b>134</b> and a second eddy current coupling assembly <b>136</b>. First eddy current assembly <b>134</b> is mounted to outer circumferential surface <b>28</b> of second portion <b>24</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>, adjacent gap <b>114</b> between first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> and second rotatable assembly <b>96</b>. First eddy current assembly <b>134</b> includes a plurality of back iron tabs <b>138</b> and a plurality of circumferentially spaced magnets <b>140</b> (i.e. magnets <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B in FIG. <b>1</b>B). A pair of magnets <b>140</b> are secured to each back iron tab <b>138</b> and the magnets of the pair are spaced apart by about 14.7 degrees, although the distance could be more or less. Each pair of magnets <b>140</b> and their associated back iron tab <b>138</b> has a corresponding pair of magnets <b>140</b> secured to a back iron tab <b>138</b> circumferentially spaced 180 degrees therefrom. In the embodiment of first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, there are four pairs of magnets <b>140</b> (for a total of eight magnets) attached to four back iron tabs <b>138</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00044">Back iron tabs <b>138</b> are fixed relative to outer circumferential surface <b>28</b> of second portion <b>24</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> by a plurality of fasteners <b>142</b> that extend through back iron tab <b>138</b> and are received by second portion <b>24</b> of first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>. Each magnet <b>140</b> is secured to back iron tab <b>138</b> by a fastener <b>144</b> which extends through magnet <b>140</b> and is received by back iron tab <b>138</b>. An outer surface <b>134</b>A of first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> is positioned within gap <b>114</b> between first and second rotatable assemblies <b>20</b> and <b>96</b> and is radially spaced apart from and aligned with inner surface <b>106</b>A of inner radial portion <b>106</b> of second radial portion <b>98</b>B of second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> such that a gap <b>146</b> is formed therebetween.</p>
  <p num="P-00045">Second eddy current assembly <b>136</b> includes a laminated back iron <b>147</b>, comprised of a stack of magnetically conductive electrically insulated steel rings <b>148</b>, and inner radial portion <b>106</b> of second radial portion <b>98</b>B of second rotatable assembly <b>96</b>. The laminated back iron <b>147</b> includes insulated rings <b>148</b>, which are stacked within annular cavity <b>110</b> defined between outer and inner radial portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of second radial portion <b>98</b>B. Insulated rings <b>148</b> are stacked within annular cavity <b>110</b> perpendicular to an axis <b>21</b> of rotation of second rotatable assembly <b>96</b>. In one embodiment, insulated rings <b>148</b> are comprised of steel to complete the flux loop, eliminate production of non-torque producing eddy currents, and increase the efficiency of eddy current drive <b>132</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00046">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, each insulated ring <b>148</b> has a surface <b>148</b>A and a surface <b>148</b>B. An insulating coating is deposited on the axially spaced radial surfaces <b>1148</b>A and <b>148</b>B of each ring <b>148</b> to electrically insulate the ring <b>148</b> from adjacent rings <b>148</b>. However, the insulating coating is not deposited along the radially extending circumferential edges of the ring. Each insulated ring <b>148</b> has a thickness between about 0.009 inches and about 0.019 inches and in one embodiment, has a thickness of about 0.018 inches. A retaining ring <b>152</b> maintains insulated rings <b>148</b> within annular cavity <b>110</b>. Retaining ring <b>152</b> is mounted in an annular groove formed in outer radial portion <b>104</b> of second radial portion <b>98</b>B.</p>
  <p num="P-00047">Inner radial portion <b>106</b> of second radial portion <b>98</b>B defines an intermediate ring of the second eddy current assembly <b>136</b>. Inner radial portion <b>106</b> is comprised of a non-magnetic material such as aluminum, and is located adjacent first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> and the laminated back iron <b>147</b>. However, in alternative embodiments of the present invention, the intermediate ring may be comprised of any non-magnetic material such as aluminum or copper. In one embodiment, the distance between first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> and second eddy current assembly, as defined by air gap <b>146</b> and inner radial portion <b>106</b>, is about 0.060 inches.</p>
  <p num="P-00048">When piston <b>68</b> is in the engaged position, first and second engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> of first and second rotatable assemblies <b>20</b> and <b>96</b>, respectfully, are engaged and abut each other. First and second eddy current assemblies <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are radially spaced apart from each other by air gap <b>146</b> and are substantially axially aligned with each other (i.e., slightly offset axially, as seen in FIG. <b>2</b>). In the engaged position, second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> (and fan blades <b>131</b>A) is driven by frictional coupling with first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>, and in particular sheave <b>26</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00049">When piston <b>68</b> is in the second, disengaged position and first and second engagement faces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> are disengaged, the first and second rotatable assemblies <b>20</b> and <b>96</b> are not frictionally coupled. However, eddy current drive <b>132</b> still causes second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> to rotate. Second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> moves axially with respect to first rotatable assembly <b>20</b> and first eddy current assembly <b>134</b>. Because eddy current drive <b>132</b> is radially mounted, air gap <b>146</b> between first and second eddy current assemblies <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> is maintained constant while allowing axial movement between the two eddy current assemblies. Thus, gap <b>146</b> between first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> and second eddy current assembly <b>136</b> remains fixed when first and second engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> disengage.</p>
  <p num="P-00050">In the piston disengaged position (shown in FIG. <b>3</b>), first and second engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> of first and second rotatable assemblies <b>20</b> and <b>96</b> are disengaged and do not abut each other (i.e., there is a gap <b>154</b> between surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b>). In the disengaged position, second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> is axially moved away from journal shaft <b>18</b> such that frictional engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> are disengaged. Second eddy current coupling assembly <b>136</b> is thereby axially moved away from journal shaft <b>18</b>. However, the axial dimensions of the first and second eddy current assemblies <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are such that once moved, second eddy current assembly <b>136</b> is axially aligned with first eddy current coupling assembly <b>134</b> (i.e., their ends are aligned in radially extending planes <b>156</b> and <b>158</b>, as seen in FIG. <b>3</b>). In the disengaged position, second rotatable assembly <b>96</b>, (and fan blades <b>131</b>A connected thereto) is driven by eddy current drive system <b>132</b>, which operates when second eddy current assembly <b>136</b> is moved axially with respect to first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> because the eddy current assemblies remain axially aligned.</p>
  <p num="P-00051">When first and second engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> are engaged (shown in FIG. <b>2</b>), no eddy currents are produced and second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> (thereby shafts <b>130</b> and fan blades <b>131</b>A) are driven by first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>, in particular sheave <b>26</b>. When first and second engagement surfaces <b>46</b> and <b>102</b> are in the disengaged position, second eddy current assembly <b>136</b>, comprised of inner radial portion <b>106</b> and the stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b>, rotates with second rotatable assembly <b>96</b> relative to piston <b>68</b>. Because of this relative rotation, eddy currents are created in intermediate ring <b>106</b> of second eddy current assembly <b>136</b>. The stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b> stops creation of non-torque producing eddy currents. However, torque producing eddy currents are still produced by eddy current drive <b>132</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00052">The rings <b>148</b> have a thickness smaller than the eddy current diameter, thus, the larger diameter eddy currents cannot pass through the insulating coating of each ring <b>148</b>, the small electric circuit (the eddy current) is broken and does not form. Each steel ring <b>148</b> contains all the magnetic flux and the insulating coating prevents the eddy current from jumping an air gap between each ring. Thus, the heat created by eddy current drive <b>132</b> is reduced and the magnetic flux only travels around the stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b>. In addition, cooling fins <b>108</b> disperse the heat produced by the drive, thereby further reducing the amount of heat in the fan drive. In the disengaged position, eddy current drive <b>132</b> drives the fan, i.e., second rotatable assembly <b>96</b>, at a second intermediate speed relative to first rotatable assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00053">The present invention uses the stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b> to eliminate non-torque producing eddy currents, while using a solid non-magnetic intermediate ring <b>106</b> to produce torque producing eddy currents. A magnetic field rotates with first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> in the radially arranged eddy current drive <b>132</b>, relative to second eddy current assembly <b>136</b>. Magnetic flux lines that produce torque producing eddy currents extend radially relative to the axis <b>21</b> and perpendicular to intermediate ring <b>106</b>. An exemplary magnetic flux line <b>133</b> is shown in FIG. <b>1</b>B. When the flux lines turn in the stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b> adjacent to intermediate ring <b>106</b>, the flux lines are no longer perpendicular to intermediate ring <b>106</b> and do not create torque producing eddy currents because the stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b> stops creation of non-torque producing eddy currents.</p>
  <p num="P-00054">In eddy current drive system <b>132</b> of the present invention, the magnetic flux line <b>133</b> leaves a first magnet <b>140</b>A (one magnet of the set) in a radial direction perpendicular to the central axis, crosses air gap <b>146</b>, continues radially through intermediate ring <b>106</b> and into the stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b> (which form a second back iron). The magnetic flux <b>133</b> is contained and turned circumferentially within each of the electrically insulated rings <b>148</b>, then turns again to continue radially inwardly back through the intermediate ring <b>106</b>, back across air gap <b>146</b> and into a magnet <b>140</b>B spaced circumferentially from the first magnet <b>140</b>A. Back iron tab <b>138</b> of first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> contains the magnetic flux <b>133</b> and completes the flux loop, by turning the flux circumferentially therein.</p>
  <p num="P-00055">In the radial arrangement of eddy current drive <b>132</b>, there is relative rotational movement between first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> (back iron tab <b>138</b> and magnets <b>140</b>) and second eddy current assembly <b>136</b> (intermediate ring <b>106</b> and stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b>). Therefore, there is a rotating magnetic field, which rotates with first eddy current assembly <b>134</b> and relative to the second eddy current assembly <b>136</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00056">Whenever there is a magnetic field rotating relative to, or at a different velocity from, a magnetic or non-magnetic material, eddy currents are created in the magnetic and non-magnetic material perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. In the radial arrangement of eddy current drive <b>132</b> of the present invention, when the magnetic fields are perpendicular to intermediate ring <b>106</b>, the eddy currents are tangent to intermediate ring <b>106</b> around the axis <b>21</b>, and the eddy currents produce a torque about the axis <b>21</b>. The flux lines that produce the torque producing eddy currents are perpendicular to the central axis and perpendicular to intermediate ring <b>106</b> in the radial arrangement. When the flux lines turn as in the stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b> they are no longer perpendicular to intermediate ring <b>106</b> and do not create torque producing eddy currents. In prior art eddy current assemblies having a solid back iron material adjacent to a non-magnetic intermediate ring, these non-torque producing eddy currents are still produced, but they are considered an inefficiency and precipitate themselves as heat. Non-torque producing eddy currents are avoided in the present invention by using the stack of electrically insulated rings <b>148</b> which eliminate the inefficient non-torque producing eddy currents and the associated heat.</p>
