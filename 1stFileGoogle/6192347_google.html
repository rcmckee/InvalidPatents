The computer system includes a digital electrical computer controlled by a processor. There is a first logic means controlling the processor in manipulating digital electrical signals representing input data to the computer, the input data characterizing at least two components decomposed from the property, the manipulating including transforming the digital electrical signals into modified digital electrical signals representing respective values for each of the components, the values being computed to reflect taxation for the components. Input means is coupled to the computer and operable for converting the input data into the digital electrical signals and communicating the digital electrical signals to the computer. Output means is coupled to receive the modified digital electrical signals from the computer and to converting the modified digital electrical signals representing the respective values into an illustration of the computed respective prices. The property can be real estate or tax-exempt securities.</div>

    <heading>I. TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p>This invention concerns a digital, electrical computer and a data processing system, and methods involving the same, applied to the financial fields of securities, real estate, and taxation. More particularly, this invention relates to a computer system for supporting a financial innovation involving the securitization of property by its decomposition into at least two components. One component can be an estate for years component and a second component can be a remainder interest. The computer system computes the respective values and investment characteristics of the components, and produces documentation thereof, to facilitate financial transactions involving the separate components.</p>
    <heading>II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <heading>A. Description of the Prior Art</heading> <p>During the last recession, a far greater number of businesses failed than would normally have been expected. Bankruptcies, financial defaults, and foreclosures on property also increased, and bad real estate loans caused an atypically large number of lenders to collapse. If there were obvious ways to increase investment return under conditions of economic stress, most likely those ways would have been uncovered long ago.</p>
    <p>Consider real estate, for example. Commercial real estate market activity was at or near a standstill for several years around the start of this decade, beginning in the last recession and continuing for more than a year past the end of the recession. Although excess development of commercial space received great attention in the financial press, there was also a drastic reduction in capital available for real estate equity investment and finance.</p>
    <p>Real estate equity capital declined as pension funds reduced or ended commitments of new equity capital to real estate capital markets. Capital for real estate finance declined correspondingly as savings and loan institutions withdrew from commercial real estate lending. Of even greater significance, real estate lending practices of insurance companies and commercial banks came under greater regulatory scrutiny in response to increased loan defaults in the early 1990s, which led to a tightening of standards for real estate loans and a reduction in flexibility on loan terms.</p>
    <p>Property values fell, and investors were uncertain of how far values had fallen because so few sales of commercial property were occurring.</p>
    <p>The problem was not a lack of potential investors. Although the pension funds had withdrawn from the markets, the core group of real estate developers and professionals involved in the markets before the pension funds entered were still committed to the real estate business and were still willing to commit capital to acquire and control real estate for business investment purposes.</p>
    <p>Nor was the problem a lack of potential financing. Despite some withdrawal by savings and loan institutions, insurance companies were still available to provide financing for sound commercial real estate developments. However, there were at least two key constraints on loan commitments by insurance companies that had the practical effect of restricting the amount of available financing.</p>
    <p>One key constraint was the emergence of a more strict regulatory environment that restricted the maturities of most loans that insurance companies were willing to make to no more than ten (10) years. This conflicted with the dictates of tax considerations for taxable investors, which suggested that the terms of loans should be at least fifteen (15) years, and preferably twenty (20) years or more.</p>
    <p>A second key constraint was that, due to high nationwide vacancy rates in commercial properties, insurance companies were making real estate loans primarily on property that was almost fully leased to tenants that were unlikely to default on their leases. Thus, credit ratings of the tenants were a prime consideration in deciding whether loans should be made.</p>
    <p>In fact, insurance companies usually viewed real estate loans as financings of existing tenant leases. Accordingly, lenders usually insisted that property owners assign the rent payments to the lenders to provide additional assurance that loan payments would be made, and lenders also insisted that the rent assignments totally amortize the loans. (The primary reason that most offered mortgages were for no more than ten years was that, in the high-vacancy rental environment existing at that time, most leases ran for no more than ten years.) Furthermore, the lenders could frequently have viewed their legal claims on the tenants' rental payments as perhaps more important than their claims on the property, because in a market with excess space, a claim on vacant space was not particularly valuable.</p>
    <p>In other words, during this period of excess rental capacity, financing necessary to sustain the level of liquidity historically experienced by the real estate markets was not available from financial institutions on acceptable terms and conditions.</p>
    <p>The result was market “gridlock” and a dearth of real estate transactions until the current economic expansion led to a nationwide increase in demand for rental space and a corresponding decrease in vacancy rates.</p>
    <p>Similar troubles have been features of the real estate market at low points in the real estate cycle at various times in the history of the market. Despite great economic pressure to improve the situation, a more efficient technology for real estate finance in an economic environment of excess rental capacity and weak economic activity has not surfaced.</p>
    <heading>III. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In response to the above, a new financial product has been developed based on the concept that property value consists of separately valuable property rights that can be worth more when sold separately. In a manner of speaking, the whole can be less than the sum of its parts.</p>
    <p>With the development of a new financial product, a need has arisen for new machines and processes to use in bringing the product to market and sustaining it. These machines and processes are the subject of the present invention.</p>
    <heading>A. Real and Personal Property</heading> <p>As an example, in the case of property that is customarily leased by corporations, leased and unleased property have different investment characteristics. Ownership of leased property is a fixed-income asset with investment characteristics that depend upon lease covenants, the market for corporate debt, and the lessees' credit ratings. By contrast, ownership of unleased property is a speculative asset having investment characteristics that depend on the spot rental market for that type of property. Thus it is possible to split ownership of this type of property into at least two components, at least one of which is a fixed-income asset.</p>
    <p>Consider real estate, for example, which can be divided into an estate for years and a remainder interest. Lenders can purchase the estate for years outright instead of writing a commercial mortgage on the whole property. Alternatively, a special purpose entity can be established to purchase the estate for years, and the lenders can purchase ownership or equity interests in the entity. Similarly, the other component—the remainder interest—can be purchased by real estate investors (or, again, the remainder interest can be purchased by a special purpose entity in which the real estate investors purchase equity or ownership interests) in lieu of the standard investment approach, in which the investor would purchase all rights to the property using some funds from a commercial loan. Examples of such special purpose entities include, but are not limited to, trusts, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies. The term of the estate for years can be determined by the parameters that describe the property, in particular by the remaining lengths of the terms of the existing leases.</p>
    <p>For purposes of this summary of the invention, in those cases in which a special purpose entity is created to hold a component, for example, such as the estate for years or remainder interest, an equity interest in the component is intended to refer to an equity interest in the special purpose entity.</p>
    <p>If the property is fully leased (or is almost fully leased), and the leases will not expire until after the estate for years has expired, then the estate for years has the investment characteristics of a fixed-income asset rather than of property. Under these circumstances, at least for real estate, insurance companies are allowed by regulators to treat the estate for years as a fixed-income investment, and to compute its value accordingly. In other words, the insurance companies value the estate for years based on cash flow characteristics of the leases and credit ratings of the tenants, and not based on the value of real estate or the risk in the real estate markets.</p>
    <p>Due to an interplay of values for the property components and the needs of respective purchasers, including tax needs, it is frequently possible to sell the components of the property separately for more than the price that the property as a whole would command.</p>
    <p>From the perspective of an investor who acquires the remainder interest, a purchaser of the estate for years has accepted an assignment of the lease payments for the term of the estate for years in return for financing the acquisition of the property by the remainder interest purchaser. From this perspective, the amount of financing provided is equal to the purchase price of the estate for years, the lease payments during the estate for years term completely amortize the financing, and the length of the financing term equals the term of the estate for years.</p>
    <p>Unlike traditional mortgage finance, shorter financing terms (less than fifteen years) are not a problem under this structure for the remainder interest investor, because: (1) during the estate for years term, the investor does not incur any tax liabilities; and (2) taking possession of the property upon expiration of the estate for years is not a taxable event for the investor. In other words, the investor does not have any tax liability until there is an obligation to pay taxes on rent payments received after taking possession of the property at the expiration of the estate for years, and those rental payments provide the cash to meet the taxes due on those payments. Therefore, the estate for years term is irrelevant to the remainder interest investor, except insofar as the term determines the amount of financing the estate for years purchaser provides (the longer the estate for years term, the greater the amount of financing). In addition, upon expiration of the estate for years, the remainder interest investor owns the property outright (i.e., without any debt).</p>
    <p>From the perspective of a financier, this financing product has no claim on the property investor (i.e., the remainder interest investor), but the strongest possible direct claim on the tenants, because the financier is the owner of record during the estate for years term. In other words, this financing product is more efficient than a commercial mortgage at matching the legal recourse claims in event of default with the asset that is actually being financed: tenant promises to pay future rent. The estate for years term can be as long as the existing leases are committed to run—typically ten years or less, although sometimes longer in the case of property that is fully leased for long terms. However, investor preferences may dictate an estate for years term that is significantly shorter than the longest lease term, and technical considerations may suggest an estate for years term that is slightly longer than the longest lease term.</p>
    <p>In addition, ownership can be structured so that the transaction creates the estate for years and the remainder interest, in order to create the most favorable tax consequences for the financier and the property investor.</p>
    <p>It is frequently the case that special purpose entities with one or more limited liability equity interests created to hold one or more components can enhance the value of equity interest(s) in the components. An opportunity for value enhancement can arise because direct ownership of an equity interest in tangible property can expose the owner to potentially unlimited legal liability as a result of events involving the property, whereas component ownership via an equity interest in the entity is a limited liability equity interest in the component. In other words, a special purpose entity with one or more limited liability equity interests can transform one or more components of a property into limited liability components, i.e., components with one or more limited liability equity interests. Thus market-based component valuation, in the case in which a component is held by an entity, involves both valuation of the investment characteristics of a component and the effect of the entity on the investment characteristics of the component.</p>
    <p>Any additional tax liability created by existence of a special purpose entity that contains one or more components of a property detracts from the investment returns that flow from the property to investors in the components, resulting in a reduction in the market values of the relevant components. The loss of value is most significant in the case of United States federal tax liabilities, since United States federal tax rates are usually higher than corresponding state and local taxes. Thus an appropriate entity for purposes of holding estate for years and remainder interests is an entity that does not incur additional tax liabilities, at least at the United States federal tax level. A pass-through entity for United States federal tax purposes is an example of such an entity. An example of such a pass-through entity is a grantor trust.</p>
    <p>Since an entity that holds one or more component interests in a property is not expected to retain significant amounts of income, another appropriate type of entity is an entity that is allowed a United States federal tax deduction for distributions to holders of equity interests in the entity.</p>
    <p>In cases in which an entity holds one or more components of a property, the entity can be used to modify investment characteristics of the components without modifying underlying leases on the property. For example, put or call options on some equity interests in the entity can be inserted into the organizational document of the entity. In the case of fixed-income components, these can be used to add features that are sometimes found in United States government bonds and corporate bonds without approaching lessees to renegotiate the leases.</p>
    <p>It is not necessary for a component to be purchased in its entirety by one investor. A component can be divided into shares so that investors can purchase fractional interests in the component. In those cases in which there is a special purpose entity for the component, fractional interests in the component can be created by dividing the equity interest in the entity into shares with equal equity participation rights. This accords prospective investors the investment option of purchasing fractional interests in the component simply by purchasing fewer than the entire number of shares in the equity interest.</p>
    <p>More generally, multiple classes of shares with various equity participation rights in the entity can be created, according investors the investment option of purchasing more general types of equity interests in the component.</p>
    <p>More particularly, an investor can purchase an equity interest in a component that is less than the entire equity interest in the component. In the case wherein the entire equity interest in the component is divided into fractional interests, each fractional interest is valued by multiplying the valuation of the component by the fraction represented by the fractional interest. In the case wherein the entire equity interest in the component is divided into more general types of equity interests, the equity interests may be valued by more general market-based techniques, such as by regarding an individual equity interest as a separate temporal component if the investment characteristics of the equity interest are those of a temporal component and valuing each such interest by the methodology introduced herein for valuing components. If one of these equity interests is then further subdivided into fractional subinterests, then each fractional subinterest is valued by multiplying the valuation of the entire equity interest by the fraction represented by the fractional subinterest.</p>
    <p>An example of more general equity interests in remainder components occurs in cases in which insurance is available to protect remainder component investors against the risk of a decline in property value below some specified value at some specified future time or time interval close to the expiration date of the estate for years term. Such insurance, known as residual value insurance, implies that the minimum possible return over the estate for years term for remainder component investors is greater than—100% so long as the insurer remains solvent, and that the value of the minimum possible investment return for the remainder component over the estate for years term is equal to the return value that will transform the remainder component purchase price into the insured minimum future property value. The existence of residual value insurance implies that the remainder component can in turn lo be decomposed into at least two types of equity interests, including a preferred equity interest that receives most or all of the protection of the residual value insurance and a residual equity interest that receives little or none of the protection of the residual value insurance.</p>
    <p>The preferred equity interest may be viewed for investment purposes as a zero-coupon fixed-income asset, possibly with a bonus feature of an equity participation on the upside, with a bond term approximately equal to the estate for years term and a credit rating equal to the credit rating of the insurer. Accordingly, the preferred equity interest will be of interest primarily to fixed-income investors and the residual equity interest will be of interest primarily to equity investors. Such preferred/residual decompositions of remainder interests carve additional fixed-income assets out of property that are essentially independent of the fixed-income assets represented by the estate for years components.</p>
    <p>In cases in which there is an entity for a component, the purchase by investors of less-than-entire interests in the component may be facilitated by the division of the equity interest in the entity into one more classes of shares. If there is a single class of shares in the entity, then a purchase of shares in the entity is equivalent to the purchase of a fractional economic interest in the component.</p>
    <p>Although it is expected that entities associated with components will be special purpose entities established to facilitate specific transactions, more general entities not designed for specific transactions may be appropriate in some circumstances. For example, this could occur in order to avoid duplicative costs associated with creating multiple separate entities in situations wherein multiple equity interests with the appropriate investment characteristics can be created with fewer entities.</p>
    <p>As in the case of special purpose entities with limited liability components, a more general entity for a component can affect both the extent of liability exposure on the part of investors in that component and also the degree of control investors in that component and possibly also investors in other components of the property as well have over the property in event of lessee default during the estate for years term. Thus market-based component valuation in the case wherein any component is held by an entity involves valuation of the investment characteristics of the component, including any effect of any entity on the investment characteristics of the component. So for example, a component that is a lease or leases packaged in an entity (e.g., a limited liability component) can have a different valuation than a naked lease or leases—more particularly, this is likely to be the case if more than one of the components is a limited liability component.</p>
    <p>There can also be cases in which there is an entity for an equity interest in a component, which can be either in lieu of or in addition to an entity for the entire component. For example, in the case of publicly traded equity interests in a component, nominal ownership of the equity interest could be held by an investor's brokerage firm, or the equity interest could be in the form of depository receipts for shares in a component such as American Depository Receipts for shares whose registered ownership resides offshore, with no material impact from an investor's perspective on the investment characteristics of the equity interest. More generally, in cases in which an entity for an equity interest has no material effect on investment return, risk, or liquidity characteristics of the equity interest, and no material effect on the degree of investor control potentially available to an investor, the existence of the entity will have no effect on valuation of the equity interest.</p>
    <p>In this way, there can be a concatenated sequence of entities for an equity interest. Such a functional sequence can be regarded for investment analysis and descriptive purposes as a single entity.</p>
    <p>The effect of such a concatenated sequence on valuation of a component can be analyzed by successively valuing the impact of each entity in the sequence, starting with the entity that is legally closest to the property and working successively towards the entity that is legally closest to the investor.</p>
    <p>In the case of real estate, the purchase price of the estate for years component alone, or a material interest therein, will almost never be large enough to cover the sale price of the property and the cost of component separation. This implies that a market-based valuation and sale of the remainder component, or a material interest therein, is an essential factor in the implementation of component separation. In the case of tangible personal property, the purchase price of the estate for years component also will almost never be large enough to cover the sale price of the property and the cost of component separation, except in those cases wherein the property can reasonably be expected to reach the end of its useful economic life during the estate for years term.</p>
    <heading>B. Tax-Exempt Finance</heading> <p>Separating property into at least two components along a time dimension (e.g., into an estate for years and a remainder interest) can also be used to enhance the investment value of tax-exempt securities such as tax-exempt general obligation bonds, tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds, and tax-exempt leases. This separation can be applied either to individual securities or to pools of tax-exempt securities. Value enhancement can be achieved in two ways: (1) cash flow streams from the components can appeal to investors who would not be interested in the entire cash flow stream of the original asset, and (2) the combined tax shelter benefits that accompany the components can be greater than the tax shelter benefits associated with the original asset. Both effects are significant, though in some situations, the tax effect will be the more dramatic of the two.</p>
    <p>Unlike the example of taxable leased property discussed above, for the tax-exempt property example, both components can be viewed as fixed-income securities. One would expect that these fixed-income securities would be valued by investors in the marketplace by comparison with other fixed-income securities.</p>
    <p>For tax-exempt securities, to effect a successful change in cash flow benefits from splitting the property or asset into components, one can proceed indirectly in separating the asset into components. Rather than directly separating ownership of the tax-exempt security itself, it is better to create an entity to hold the tax-exempt security, and then to separate one or more of the equity interests in the entity along the time dimension into estate for years and remainder components.</p>
    <p>From a legal perspective, creating tax-exempt components can be accomplished within the framework of a general or special purpose entity, examples of which include general and limited partnerships and mutual funds. However, to create limited-liability components, smooth the cash flow streams, and avoid an imposition of unusual bookkeeping requirements on fixed-income investors, an entity with one or more limited liability equity interests is the preferred format, with some limited liability equity interests as the assets that are subject to component separation. To enhance marketability of the components, and to facilitate investor valuation of the components by comparison with alternative fixed-income investments available in the marketplace, the entity may alter the frequency of cash flows to holders of equity interests from schedules of the original assets (e.g., the original assets could generate monthly cash flows, and the components could generate semiannual cash flows).</p>
    <p>In general, component separation will produce two effects: (1) the estate for years components will generate more tax deductions than are necessary to shelter the cash flows of this component from taxes; and (2) the remainder interest component will generate fewer tax deductions than are necessary to shelter the cash flows of this component from taxes (the tax obligations associated with the remainder component will still be lower than those associated with a conventional taxable fixed-income security). It is also possible that, in some situations, purchasers of taxable securities may view remainder interests as taxable securities and value those interests more highly than investors in tax-exempt securities.</p>
    <p>The same component separation technology can be applied to separate the following fixed-income assets along the time dimension into components: a taxable fixed-income security, a portfolio of taxable fixed-income securities, a portfolio of taxable and tax-exempt fixed-income securities. More generally, the same component separation technology can be applied to any asset or portfolio of assets that is either ratable as if it were a fixed-income security (possibly of investment grade), where the term “ratable” refers in general to fixed-income ratings assigned by widely recognized investment rating agencies such as Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, or classifiable for regulatory purposes as a fixed-income security (possibly of investment grade) by a major regulatory agency for financial institutions or institutional investors, e.g., National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) investment classifications assigned by the NAIC Securities Valuation Office or the offices of individual state insurance commissioners. However, in general the maximum incremental tax benefits that can be generated are smaller than in the case of tax-exempt fixed-income securities.</p>
    <p>The combined investment value of the tax deductions generated by the various components may be greater than, equal to, or lower than the tax deductions associated with the original tax-exempt or taxable asset(s). Since creating an entity to hold the original securities requires a diversion of a portion of the asset cash flow stream to pay administrative expenses associated with maintenance of the entity, component separation of securities is likely to be of interest only when the combined value of tax deductions generated by the components exceeds tax deductions associated with the original asset(s).</p>
    <p>In general, determining a schedule of economic benefits associated with various equity interests in the entity, valuing the tax deductions associated with the components, and pricing of the components as fixed-income securities, are computation-intensive procedures.</p>
    <heading>C. Automated Support</heading> <p>To efficiently offer the above-described financial products, it would be best to use automated means to do computing and data processing, i.e., machine, manufacture, and process applied to supporting the proper structuring and pricing of the components. Efficiency also dictates a need to use automated means to incorporate the computational output in generating financial documents associated with a separated purchase transaction.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the invention has an object providing a machine, manufacture, and process for providing applied to financial analytical data automation, including pricing data, for the decomposition of property.</p>
    <p>A further object of the invention is to provide the same applied to supporting a new financing product that is based on providing financing of preferably fifteen years or less, while also allowing taxable investors to avoid tax problems encountered with typical mortgage financing.</p>
    <p>Another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to calculating financial particulars of the property based on the concept that the source of property value is property rights that can be split and separately valued.</p>
    <p>Another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to using the financial particulars in efficiently tailoring financial documents to support transactions involving property components.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide the same applied to real estate as the property.</p>
    <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to supporting the decomposition of real estate into an estate for years and a remainder interest, particularly for computing the price, including tax, of these components.</p>
    <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide the same to computing the after-tax yield for the estate for years and the equivalent pretax yield that would be required to obtain the same after-tax return from a bond.</p>
    <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the same applied to equity interests in entities that hold tax-exempt securities or pools of tax-exempt securities as the property.</p>
    <p>Yet another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to supporting the decomposition of equity interests in entities that hold tax-exempt securities or pools of tax-exempt securities into estate for years and remainder interests, particularly for computing the price, including tax, of these components.</p>
    <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to analyzing the returns offered based on certain assumptions to inform potential investors of the range of outcomes as they relate to certain inputs.</p>
    <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide the same applied to generating data so that comparisons can be made to alternative investment opportunities.</p>
    <p>These and other objects are addressed by a digital computer having a logic means for controlling electrical signal processing and modification. The logic means can be completely hard wired or it can be programmable so that one or more computer programs can run on the digital computer. Preferably an embodiment includes a computer program running on a programmable digital computer system to provide financial analytical data concerning decomposed property. The computer system is connected to receive information representing a description of the characteristics of the property from a data input means, such as a keyboard. The computer system also outputs computed data and documentation to an output means and saves the output financial analysis to a memory system. The computer system also has a second means for automatically controlling the digital computer to produce financial documents from the financial analysis and model documents stored in the memory system.</p>
    <p>The computer system uses as input data information obtained from a variety of sources, including The Wall Street Journal tabulation of daily Treasury bond interest rates, insurance company weekly publications that list private placement debt risk premia, the property offering documents, and the property lease documents. For applications to tax-exempt finance, the computer system also uses tax-exempt bond finance interest rates tabulated and published daily by such sources as Telerate Systems.</p>
    <p>With this information, it is possible to compute the following: (1) the optimal choice of the estate for years term to maximize profitability of the components; (2) whether risk characteristics of either component are appropriate for inclusion in a prospective investor's portfolio; and if so, (3) whether an expected return justifies the system-determined purchase price.</p>

    <heading>V. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading> <heading>A. Financial Innovation</heading> <p>FIG. 1 illustrates the nature of the financial innovation that gave rise to the need for the computer system and methods of the present invention. Rights to a Subject Property <b>2</b> (any property whatsoever, but in a preferred embodiment, real estate) are leased to a Lessee <b>4</b>, preferably an investment-grade lessee, for a definite term, in exchange for rent. All rights to the Subject Property <b>2</b> and cash flow from rent money from the Subject Property <b>2</b> are conveyed to an investor in an estate for years or to an entity with one or more limited liability equity interests, for example a trust, that holds title to the estate for years and that—absent any competing claims—flows the rent money through to the investor. Financial Intermediary <b>6</b> separates the Subject Property <b>2</b> and cash flow of rent money into at least two components, using a computer system and methods of the present invention. The components are securitized into rights to an Estate For Years <b>8</b> and a Remainder Interest <b>10</b>. For example, property law provides mechanisms for the temporal decomposition of property. In the case of real estate, one mechanism is to create multiple deeds. For example, there can be a deed to a term interest in a property, and a separate deed to a remainder interest in the property. In nearly all states, both deeds represent real interests in the property. Similarly, in the case of tangible personal property there can be multiple titles, for example, a title to a term interest in a property and a separate title to a remainder interest in the property. The use of a financial intermediary facilitates the separation process but is not necessary in all cases.</p>
    <p>The term of separation usually coincides with the remaining term on the existing tenant lease, and is almost never longer than the shortest remaining tenant lease term. The estate for years component can, therefore, be viewed as a fixed-income asset, but tax considerations may dictate whether the remainder component is viewed as a pure equity asset or as a mixture of pure equity and fixed-income.</p>
    <p>When component separation takes place, Subject Property <b>2</b> is sold to the Financial Intermediary <b>6</b>, and two trusts may be established to acquire actual titles to the respective components. For example, the estate for years can be a term of years interest. In the case of real estate as the property, one trust is issued a deed to the term of years interest by the property seller and the other trust is issued a deed to the remainder interest by the property seller. In the case of tangible personal property as the property, one trust is issued a bill of sale for the term of years interest by the property seller and the other trust is issued a bill of sale for the remainder interest by the property seller.</p>
    <p>Any existing property debt is retired at, or prior to, the time of acquisition. An obligation of any trustee of the trust for the Estate for Years <b>8</b> is to preserve title to the estate for years and to prevent any property encumbrances from being established during the separation term.</p>
    <p>If there is an estate for years trust, it has a term beneficial interest, and if there is a remainder interest trust it has a remainder beneficial interest. The term beneficiary has all rights and obligations of estate for years ownership during the trust term except a right to encumber the property or petition a court to terminate or dissolve the estate for years/remainder interest structure. A remainder beneficiary enjoys no rights or benefits until the term interest expires, and then enjoys all rights and benefits of the fee simple title.</p>
    <p>In this case, the term beneficial interest becomes the (fixed-income) estate for years component, and the remainder beneficial interest becomes the remainder component.</p>
    <p>The components are both viewed as personal property for legal purposes. Ownership of either component can be transferred without affecting the legal status or investment characteristics of the Subject Property <b>2</b> or the other component. Similarly, while legal judgments against the owner of either component can create a lien against that component, such judgments cannot create a lien against the Subject Property <b>2</b> or the other component.</p>
    <p>For tax purposes (usually for United States tax purposes), the holder of the estate for years component (or an equity interest therein) is usually entitled to amortize the acquisition cost (e.g., purchase price) of the estate for years component (or the acquisition cost of the equity interest therein) over the portion of the estate for years term remaining after acquisition of the estate for years component (or the equity interest therein).</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the estate for years holder may be entitled to both depreciation and amortization deductions. In this case however, the value of the deductions is interleaved, not additive. That is, although the combined deduction would be greater than the amortization deduction alone, the combined deduction would be smaller than the sum of the amortization and depreciation deductions.</p>
    <p>As an additional alternative, in some cases in which there is a single entity for both the estate for years and remainder components, the estate for years holder may be entitled to cost recovery in the form of depreciation of the temporally decomposed property in lieu of amortization of the estate for years purchase price. These situations usually involve tangible personal property and leases with terms that are longer than the statutory cost recovery period for that type of property, in which cost recovery via depreciation is faster for the estate for years investor than cost recovery via amortization of the estate for years price over the lease term.</p>
    <p>Whichever cost recovery deduction schedule is claimed by the estate for years holder, the tax treatment of the estate for years will be different from the treatment claimed by the holder of conventional taxable debt, because for tax purposes, the estate for years is an income-producing asset rather than a debt instrument:</p>
    <p>If the estate for years component holder is a corporate investor, then the tax write-offs accruing from component separation are available to offset taxes on either passive or operating income.</p>
    <p>Separation is facilitated if the lease(s) is triple-net, i.e., during the trust term, the lease(s) obligates the tenant to the estate for years component holder for property management and maintenance, payment of taxes, and property insurance. Thus, absent a default by a tenant, the rights and obligations of the estate for years component holder involve the right to receive scheduled net rental payments, while the benefits of property occupancy belong to the tenant. The only claim of the estate for years component holder on any property asset is a contingent one, in event of a tenant default.</p>
    <p>In a tenant default, the estate for years component holder has recourse against the tenant as prescribed by property law and the lease covenants. This recourse against both tenant financial assets and the remaining portion of term property occupancy rights is the subject of traditional principles of property law. The availability of tax write-offs accruing from component separation continues unaffected by a tenant default event.</p>
    <p>The default risk associated with the estate for years is identical to the default risk associated with tenant general obligation debt. The expected value of the combined estate for years default claims compares favorably with the claims available to the holders of tenant unsubordinated debentures.</p>
    <p>Leased and unleased property have different investment characteristics. The nature of this difference can be illustrated by considering the extreme cases of two unleveraged general purpose single-tenant properties of similar size, location, and architecture, one perpetually leased on a triple-net basis to an investment-grade tenant, the other momentarily unleased.</p>
    <p>In the case of the perpetually leased property, all future rental cash flows is are determined. Absent tenant default, there will be no future rental negotiations. Thus, there are no present values that fluctuate with changes in the spot market for comparable space, implying that the value of this property does not depend on the real estate market. Property value in this case depends solely on the contracted values of future net cash flows, tenant credit risk, and long-term interest rates. In other words, this asset has the investment characteristics of tenant debt.</p>
    <p>By contrast, all future rentals from the unleased property are as yet undetermined, and the present value of these rentals fluctuates with expectations about the future evolution of the spot rental market. In short, this asset is a pure real estate equity investment, with no fixed-income component.</p>
    <p>Typical institutional-grade property is not well represented by either extreme. Such property is usually fully leased or almost-fully leased for a reasonable period of time, with arrangements for tenant occupancy beyond that period open to future negotiation. As in the case of perpetually leased property, existing leases have the investment characteristics of fixed-income assets, whereas the speculative risk dimensions investors associate with equity real estate are due entirely to the remaining rights in the property asset: the right to future rental opportunities after existing leases expire.</p>
    <p>By securitizing net-leased property to separate ownership of current leases from ownership of future leases, the net-leased property is decomposed into estate for years and pure equity remainder components. The estate for years components are appropriate for investors interested in traditional fixed-income investments, while the pure equity remainders are appropriate for real estate investors, speculators, and tax-exempt institutions interested in acquiring portfolio diversification benefits of real estate at a fraction of the cost for all components of the real estate.</p>
    <p>The separation of property into components can create major tax benefits if property is properly securitized and the components are sold to independent investors in a simultaneous three-way transaction.</p>
    <p>As part of the undivided property, most of the lease cash flows are taxable income, while as a stand-alone asset, most of the lease cash flows are tax-exempt. This suggests a change in the appropriate buyers for lease income streams. As part of whole property, lease income produces the greatest after-tax benefit for tax-exempt institutions; whereas, packaged as stand-alone assets with incremental tax deductions, taxable institutions are natural investors.</p>
    <p>The present value of the incremental tax deductions generated during the estate for years term by separation of ownership into components is an enhancement to property value. This implies that the combined market values of securitized components should be greater than the value of unsecuritized property. The tax deductions themselves can also be viewed as a fixed-income asset, which can be valued by fixed-income techniques. Alternatively, the combined value of incremental tax deductions and the lease income stream can be valued by fixed-income techniques as a single fixed-income package.</p>
    <p>From a tax perspective, the estate for years is an income-producing asset; from the return/risk perspective, it is an asset-backed bond. Unlike commercial mortgages, the default claims generated by the estate for years have recourse against financial assets held by the entities who have obligated themselves to make the cash flow payments.</p>
    <p>The example herein involves a single-tenant property; the case of multitenant property component separation is slightly more complicated if the lease terms of tenants vary. Because the estate for years must have the characteristics of a fixed income asset, it may be that a credit enhancing instrument such as an insurance policy against tenant default will have to be created to wrap around the lease agreements to achieve the characteristics of a marketable fixed income asset. The use of such an enhancement may broaden the application of the separation process in both single-tenant and multitenant property by creating investment-grade estate for years fixed-income components in properties without investment-grade tenants. Alternatively, there may be cases of properties with below-investment-grade tenants in which it is not cost-effective to reduce the default risk of the estate for years components with credit enhancement insurance. In these cases, equity interests in the estate for years components will be ratable as fixed-income securities, for example, that are below investment-grade, where the term “ratable” refers throughout this investment description to fixed-income ratings assigned by widely recognized investment rating agencies such as Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, or classifiable for regulatory purposes as fixed-income securities, for example, that are below investment-grade, by a major regulatory agency for financial institutions or institutional investors, e.g., National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) investment classifications assigned by the NAIC Securities Valuation Office or the offices of individual state insurance commissioners.</p>
    <p>In the case of single-tenant property, the estate for years default risk is determined by the tenant credit rating. Thus, the estate for years default risk is identical to the default risk of tenant debentures. In the event of tenant default, the estate for years owner has the same claim on tenant financial assets as holders of tenant debentures, so long as the tenant does not declare bankruptcy.</p>
    <p>In tenant bankruptcy, the estate for years holder has a combination of claims with combined values that can be shown to exceed the expected recovery rate on defaulted corporate debentures, as determined by average prices on publicly traded debentures immediately after default and by asset recovery rates subsequent to defaults on unsubordinated general obligation debt.</p>
    <p>In other words, estate for years default risk is the same as default risk on general obligation tenant debt, but in default the loss risk is less. This can be reflected in pricing the component, as illustrated below.</p>
    <p>One possibility is to generate an investment-grade estate for years component (e.g., a component such that at least one certificate evidencing ownership or beneficial ownership of the component, a fractional interest therein, or an equity interest therein, is an investment-grade security), for example, with between four percent (4%) and six and one half percent (6{fraction (1/12)}%) after-tax yields under current property market conditions. This is an after-tax premium of between 20 and 170 basis points over corporate debentures of comparable credit risk. Alternatively, this represents an approximate pre-tax equivalent premium of between 25 and 230 basis points for taxable buyers in a 36% marginal tax bracket.</p>
    <p>These premia can be expected to erode slowly as the markets for the property components develop. Sellers will learn to value each component separately in arriving at property valuation. (To value each component, one could use separate computer systems to compute such valuation for each component separately. In effect, this approach is the invention disclosed herein divided into two computer systems, one for each component. Such an approach is viewed as an equivalent to the present invention.) In any case, eventually multiple bidders for estate for years interests will drive estate for years yield premia down to double or single-digit basis points. However, by placing the estate for years interests privately, dissemination of this embodiment of the investment technology may lag.</p>
    <p>In short, when viewed as a financial asset, unleveraged commercial property is a portfolio comprised of at least two components with different investment characteristics: a fixed-income asset essentially consisting of all ownership rights while existing leases are in place, and a pure equity component essentially consisting of all ownership rights after existing leases expire.</p>
    <heading>B. Computer System</heading> <p>The present invention is directed to a computer system for manipulating digital electrical signals to produce an illustration of a decomposition of property into separately valued components. The computer system includes a digital electrical computer controlled by a processor. A first logic means controls the processor in manipulating digital electrical signals representing input data to the computer, the input data characterizing at least two components decomposed from the property. The manipulating includes transforming the digital electrical signals into modified digital electrical signals representing respective values for each of the components, the values being computed to reflect taxation for the components. Input means is electrically coupled to the computer and operable for converting the input data (which can be entered manually) into the digital electrical signals and communicating the digital electrical signals to the computer. Output means is electrically coupled to receive the modified digital electrical signals from the computer and to convert the modified digital electrical signals representing the respective values into an illustration of the computed respective prices.</p>
    <p>The computer system can additionally include a second logic means for controlling the processor in further manipulating the electrical signals, the further manipulating producing at least one financial document for one of the components, the is financial document being constructed in response to electrical signals representing preexisting text and stored in memory accessed by said computer and in response to said modified digital electrical signals representing the respective values.</p>
    <p>The computer system can be used in cooperation with one or more computer systems in respective locations to either recompute the computations (i.e., signal processing) discussed above or do supplemental computations (i.e., signal processing) as discussed below.</p>
    <p>The property can be any property or divisible property right. Preferably, the property is real estate, but in another preferred embodiment, the property is a tax-exempt security.</p>
    <p>More particularly, with reference to FIG. 2, the hardware, input, and output of a Computer System <b>12</b> according to the present invention are shown. The System <b>12</b> includes a Digital Computer <b>14</b>, such as an IBM-compatible personal computer with a DOS operating system. Digital Computer <b>14</b> preferably has a model 486 central processor or a 386 central processor with a math coprocessor. Digital Computer <b>14</b> is operably linked to a Keyboard <b>16</b>, for receiving Input Data <b>18</b> (described more particularly below with regard to FIG. 3) and converting it into electrical signals. Digital Computer <b>14</b> also is operably linked to output means, such as a Monitor <b>20</b> and a Printer <b>22</b> (such as a dot-matrix or laser printer) for outputting Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b> (described more particularly below with regard to Specimen 1) and Processed Component Financial Documents <b>26</b> (described more particularly below with regard to Specimens 3 and 4).</p>
    <p>Digital Computer <b>14</b> is additionally operably linked to Memory System <b>28</b>, comprising a means for storing Logic Means <b>30</b>, such as a diskette or a hard disk, and a means for communicating the Logic Means <b>30</b> to the Digital Computer <b>14</b>, such as a disk drive. Logic Means <b>30</b> can be a LOTUS 123 (Version 2.01 or higher) computer program, which is used to produce Specimen 1, though as described subsequently, a program dedicated to the purposes of this invention would be preferable.</p>
    <p>When loaded and running on Digital Computer <b>14</b>, Logic Means <b>30</b> controls the Computer System <b>12</b> transforming the electrical signals from Keyboard <b>16</b> into electrical signals associated with constructing files <b>32</b> (or records, if so desired) and of Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b>. Storing a plurality of data files <b>32</b> would be appropriate, for example, for analyzing different separated purchase transactions or for analyzing how one or more changes in Input Data <b>18</b> influence the Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>Memory System <b>28</b> also stores a Word Processing Program <b>34</b>, such as Word Perfect 5.1. Word Processing Program <b>34</b> is useful for constructing and editing text files to be printed via Printer <b>22</b> as Processed Component Financial Documents <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>Preferably, one text file includes a Stored Model Financial Document For the Estate For Years <b>36</b>, for example, an organizational document (e.g., for an entity for the estate for years real estate component such that certificates evidencing equity interest in the entity are securities, as exemplified in Specimen 3) or a disclosure document for securities law purposes for the securitized estate for years real estate component (e.g., for an equity interest in the securitized estate for years real estate component, as exemplified in Specimen 5). Another text file includes Stored Model Financial Document For Remainder Component <b>38</b>, for example, an organizational document (e.g., for an entity for the remainder real estate component such that certificates evidencing equity interest in the entity are securities, as exemplified in Specimen 4) or a disclosure document for securities law purposes for the securitized remainder real estate component (e.g., for an equity interest in the securitized remainder real estate component, as exemplified in Specimen 6). Still another text file includes Stored Other Financial Documents <b>37</b>, detailed subsequently herein.</p>
    <p>It is to be explicitly understood that other implementations of the present invention, say, those using a different kind of digital computer, analogous hardware, multiple computer systems, comparable input and output, a computer program or programs written in a different language, or a hardwired system replacing the computer program, are entirely acceptable and equivalent to the present invention. Also the invention can be implemented by hardwired logic in a handheld calculator. When software is loaded into, and running, a programmable computer, the software sets what in effect are many, many “switches,” and the result can be considered a new computer machine, with logic formed from the set switches. Instead of setting the switches, an equivalent would be to hardwire the same or equivalent circuitry. Therefore, whether a configurable device is configured to the requirements of the present invention, or a device is constructed from scratch solely for meeting the requirements of the present invention, is a distinction without a difference from an electrical signal processing standpoint. All these embodiments are different species of the present invention that are within the contemplated scope of the present invention.</p>
    <heading>C. Logic Means <b>30</b> </heading> <p>Focusing more particularly on Logic Means <b>30</b>, it should be recognized that System <b>12</b> is intended for a specific purpose, for operation under certain assumptions, to compute the values of components decomposed from property, and to provide documentation thereof; System <b>12</b> involves certain Input Data <b>18</b> and Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b>, each of which is discussed below in greater detail.</p>
    <p>1. Purpose</p>
    <p>The Logic Means <b>30</b>, in conjunction with the rest of System <b>12</b>, is intended to facilitate financial transactions involving the separate components of property, preferably commercial real estate in a separated purchase transaction. For a separated purchase transaction to take place, the sum of the prices the two investors agree to pay for their respective components should theoretically be at least equal to a price at which the owner is willing to sell the property.</p>
    <p>Logic Means <b>30</b> partially automates financial considerations that take into account the different investment characteristics of the two components. This facilitates or reduces the cost for, carving a property value into respective values, which can be treated as prices, for the estate for years and the remainder interest. In addition, Logic Means <b>30</b>, in conjunction with Digital Computer <b>14</b>, calculates various financial parameters to assist prospective purchasers in deciding whether the components are suitable as investments at the respective sale prices.</p>
    <p>Logic Means <b>30</b>, in conjunction with Digital Computer <b>14</b>, calculates throughout the estate for years the values and tax bases of the separate components so that the sale and purchase of each component may take place privately or through a financial exchange established to provide liquidity in a market in which none presently exists.</p>
    <p>Further, Logic Means <b>30</b>, in conjunction with Digital Computer <b>14</b>, provides accounting support to the estate for years investor by computing, on both annual and quarterly bases, the tax deductions generated by the property and the estate for years. These deductions may be used by the estate for years investor to reduce taxes on income produced by the estate for years and in certain other taxable operations. Because these deductions affect the basis of the remainder interest upon expiration of the estate for years, the accounting support set forth is also necessary for the remainder interest.</p>
    <p>Logic Means <b>30</b> can also be used in conjunction with Word Processing Program <b>34</b> to efficiently incorporate Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b> into Financial Documents <b>26</b> (and to edit and revise the stored Model Financial Documents <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> for each separate purchase transaction) for each of the components.</p>
    <p>2. Assumptions</p>
    <p>The Logic Means <b>30</b> is intended to support the separated purchase transaction of real estate in which the estate for years has a definite and specified term, and in which the property is leased for rent prior to, or coincident with, the separated purchase transaction. For the estate for years to be an asset with fixed-income investment characteristics, the term of the estate for years is normally no longer than the shortest term remaining on the lease(s). That is, the estate for years entitles the holder to the right to receive the net cash flows from the existing leases until the end of the term. Furthermore, the risk of default on the scheduled cash flow(s) is determined by either the lowest-rated tenant credit risk or the value-weighted average credit risk of the tenants, with the former the norm.</p>
    <p>It is assumed in this embodiment that ownership of the components is structured so that, after the separated purchase transaction, the purchaser(s) of the estate for years is (are) entitled to amortize the estate for years purchase price for tax purposes and also over the estate for years term. Additionally, it is assumed that any depreciation deductions are to be taken by the estate for years purchaser(s). Finally, it is assumed in this embodiment that the entire investment return on any preferred equity interest in the remainder component is insured via residual insurance, that the preferred equity interest does not have any participatory interest in the investment return on the remainder component other than the insured return, and that none of the residual value insurance is left over to insure the return on the residual equity interest in the remainder component. This implies that the preferred interest is a ratable fixed-income asset and that it is usually an investment-grade fixed-income asset in cases in which the residual value insurer has an investment grade credit rating.</p>
    <p>In addition, it is assumed in this embodiment that the cost of the residual value insurance is payable in the form of a single up-front insurance premium at the time the property is separated into components. Other embodiments can incorporate general schedules and amounts of residual value insurance premium payments over the estate for years term. Still other embodiments can provide for the possibility that creation of a preferred interest in a remainder component, the purchase of residual value insurance for the preferred interest, or both the creation of a preferred interest in a remainder component and the purchase of residual value insurance for the preferred interest, can occur as one or more events subsequent to separation of the property into estate for years and remainder interests. These and yet other embodiments can also allow for the cost of possible interim financing for the remainder interest prior to the time the residual value insurance takes effect.</p>
    <p>3. Pricing the Estate for Years</p>
    <p>Under the above assumptions, the risk and return characteristics of the estate for years are those of a fixed-income asset. This implies that prospective investors will price the estate for years as a fixed-income investment, i.e., prospective purchasers will value the estate for years relative to comparable investments available in the bond market at the time of the separated purchase transaction.</p>
    <p>Specifically, prospective purchasers of the estate for years will look at the available yield on Treasury securities of comparable cash flow characteristics for a comparable average life, add a risk premium based on the average credit risk of the tenants and, under present market conditions, probably add an additional premium due to the illiquidity of the investment. The sum of the appropriate Treasury rate plus the risk and the illiquidity premiums is a typical fixed income market discount rate for the estate for years.</p>
    <p>4. Input Data <b>18</b> </p>
    <p>Generally, in order to value the estate for years as a fixed-income investment, a schedule of net cash flows during the estate for years term is determined. Typically, this will comprise a stream of scheduled monthly net rental payments. If the estate for years does not begin on the first day of a month and terminate on the last day of a calendar month, net rental payments could also include fractional monthly rental payments for the first and last months of the estate for years term. In addition, the date of the split purchase transaction, and the date that the estate for years terminates, are also entered as Input Data <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>Estate for years valuation also includes the appropriate discount rate for the estate for years. But instead of inputting this number directly, the Logic Means <b>30</b> prompts a request (as Input Data <b>18</b>) for the appropriate annualized Treasury bond interest rate for bonds of an equivalent average life to the estate for years, plus an appropriate risk/illiquidity premium, as discussed above.</p>
    <p>To compute the remainder interest purchase price, the property sale price, together with any extra expenses (i.e., fees and commissions) arising in the securitization of the real estate components, are also entered as Input Data <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>To estimate the depreciation and amortization deductions to which the estate for years purchaser is entitled, the Logic Means <b>30</b> assumes that the percentage of the property purchase price represented by land is not depreciable, but that the remaining portion of the purchase price is depreciable, as prescribed by the tax code. Thus, the Logic Means <b>30</b> requires the user to enter the percentage of property value that is not depreciable and the amounts and depreciation schedules for the remaining portions of the purchase price.</p>
    <p>To project the after-tax cash flows of the estate for years investor, and hence this investor's projected after-tax income rate, the Logic Means <b>30</b> also uses the projected tax bracket schedule of the estate for years investor as Input Data <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>To calculate the implied purchase price of the property for the remainder interest buyer at the time the estate for years expires, the Logic Means <b>30</b> further uses an implied risk-free opportunity cost of capital for the remainder interest buyer, typically though not necessarily the zero-coupon risk-free Treasury rate for the estate for years term, as Input Data <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>5. Elements of the Financial Analysis Output</p>
    <p>Elements of the Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b> of Logic Means <b>30</b> include (1) a representation of the price for the estate for years component, and (2) a representation of the price for the remainder interest component. The price an estate for years investor is willing to pay can be computed from the net rental cash flows, the interest rates in the bond markets, and the credit ratings of the tenants. The Logic Means <b>30</b> discounts the sequence of net rental payments scheduled during the estate for years term at the required estate for years discount rate to determine an appropriate purchase price for the estate for years. The price a remainder interest investor must pay is computed as the difference between: (1) the sum of the property asking price plus the costs and fees associated with separating the components, and (2) the estate for years valuation. This formula follows because between them the purchasers of the components must come up with the property asking price together with any extra expenses associated with creating the components. If these prices are acceptable to prospective component purchasers, then a separated purchase transaction of the real estate interests can be consummated.</p>
    <p>6. Additional Output</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the invention, Logic Means <b>30</b> can have Compute Present Value of Enhancement <b>117</b>, which computes the present value of the enhancement in property value due to component separation. This value is computed as the difference between the present value of the estate for years after-tax cash flows, and the after-tax cash flows the estate for years would generate if the estate for years were still a part of undivided property and subject to the same tax deductions available to the owner of undivided property. The discount rate used to compute this present value is the after-tax income yield rate for both sets of cash flows.</p>
    <p>Logic Means <b>30</b> outputs the present value of the enhancement in two forms: expressed as a dollar amount, and expressed as a percentage of the gross property sale price.</p>
    <p>The present value of the enhancement must be greater than the cost of extra fees and commissions due to securitization, in order for component separation to be a value-enhancing process.</p>
    <p>Value enhancement is a rough measure of the attractiveness of component separation in each prospective transaction. However, it is not used directly in pricing components, nor in preparing documentation describing investment characteristics of the components.</p>
    <p>7. Computer Screens and Logic</p>
    <p>A preferred embodiment of this invention would involve a stand alone computer and a computer program (Logic Means <b>30</b>) stored on a hard disk (of Memory System <b>28</b>) of a 486 Personal computer (Digital Computer <b>14</b>). Unlike a hardwired equivalent embodiment, a programmable Computer System <b>12</b> is more readily adaptable to produce whatever output a user of Computer System <b>12</b> may desire with respect to a prospective separated purchase transaction. The preferred programming language is structured BASIC, although C, Fortran, or any other language with mathematical formulaic capabilities is acceptable. The operating version of the computer program for users should be in compiled code.</p>
    <p>The Logic Means <b>30</b> includes Shell <b>40</b>, which permits the option of accessing Word Processing Program <b>34</b> or a Title Screen <b>42</b> of a data processing system. Title Screen <b>42</b> informs the user of the name and ownership of the Logic Means <b>30</b>, notice of any copyrights or patents that involve the invention, etc.</p>
    <p>The Title Screen <b>42</b> leads to a Menu <b>44</b> screen created by Computer System <b>12</b> to query the user as to whether the user wants to retrieve one of the Data Files <b>32</b> stored from a previous run of the Logic Means <b>30</b> that the user saved in Memory System <b>28</b> or to create a new data file to become a new one of the stored Data Files <b>32</b>. If the user makes a menu selection indicating that the Logic Means <b>30</b> should retrieve one of the stored Data Files <b>32</b>, the Logic Means <b>30</b> asks on a Retrieve Stored Data File Screen <b>46</b> for the name and directory of the selected Data File <b>32</b>. Block <b>48</b> performs the function of recalling the appropriate one of Data File <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, the user can make a menu selection at Block <b>44</b> to create a New Data File <b>50</b>. Regardless of which of these selections is made, Logic Means <b>30</b> displays a Data Form <b>52</b> like Screen <b>1</b> of Specimen 1, which will either have blank spaces to receive Input Data <b>18</b> to fill in the Data Form or will already be completed as a stored Data File <b>32</b>. Specimen 1, Screen <b>1</b>, herein is a representation of a completed data form. This representation, which is illustrative only, involves 10-year leases and a certain pattern of rents, and as such, it is a limited illustration of the capabilities of the invention discussed herein. Also, a portion of the Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b> is presented in Screen <b>2</b> and Screen <b>3</b> of Specimen 1, which is a simplification over the use of a dedicated program to generate the Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b> after all of the Input Data <b>18</b> has been entered.</p>
    <p>The Logic Means <b>30</b> has an Input/Edit Data Form <b>54</b> screen adapted to receive Input Data <b>18</b> from the user by manual operation of Keyboard <b>16</b>. Thereby, the user is able to enter or edit a column of rents until all payments have been entered. The user is also able to edit data on the data form, as is discussed more particularly below. Editing a data form recalled from Data File <b>32</b> efficiently enables recomputing similar data without having to enter data all anew. Instructions informing the user of which keys perform the functions can appear at the top or bottom of the screen. After the user is satisfied that all information solicited in the data form has been entered correctly, the user enters a command to enable Data Processing <b>56</b>. The Logic Means <b>30</b>, in conjunction with Digital Computer <b>14</b>, calculates the output parameters indicated in FIG. <b>4</b> to produce a new Data Form as Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b> in FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>The Logic Means <b>30</b> also provides options to Print <b>58</b> the Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b> and to Store <b>60</b> the Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b> as a Data File <b>32</b>. The user makes a selection at Blocks <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> by pressing an appropriate key on Keyboard <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>The Logic Means <b>30</b> returns to the Main Menu <b>44</b> to either repeat the aforesaid sequence or to quit <b>62</b> to the Shell <b>40</b>. The action of pressing an exit key at any point in the sequence, if this feature is used, should bring up a fail-safe screen requesting the user to confirm the exit instruction by pressing another designated key, or cancel the exit instruction by pressing any other key.</p>
    <p>From Shell <b>40</b>, the user can alternatively enter a selection to call up the Word Processing Program <b>34</b>. Word Processing Program <b>34</b> can access the Stored Model Estate For Years Financial Document <b>36</b> or the Stored Model Remainder Component Financial Document <b>38</b> or other financial documents to modify the selected document to include information computed from Process Data <b>56</b>. This information can include the expected returns under various performance scenarios, the price, and various quantitative descriptions of risk, e.g., prices under various scenarios. Process Data <b>56</b> can be contained entirely within one computer or can encompass a group of at least two computers that communicate electronically. Thus, computations of the expected returns under the various performance scenarios can take place entirely within one computer or can take place within a group of computers that communicate computations and/or data on the expected returns under the various investment scenarios electronically within the group. Similarly, computations of the prices under the various performance scenarios can take place entirely within one computer or can take place within a group of computers that communicate computations and/or data on the prices under the various investment scenarios electronically within the group.</p>
    <p>Edit <b>63</b> involves editing any of the stored model documents of Block <b>36</b>, Block <b>37</b>, and Block <b>38</b>, particularly to incorporate information from a Stored Data File <b>32</b>. Print Document <b>64</b> permits printing the modified selected document at Printer <b>22</b> as one of the Processed Component Financial Documents <b>26</b>. Store Document <b>66</b> permits storing the modified selected document via Memory System <b>28</b>. Quit to Word Processing Program <b>68</b> inquires whether the user prefers to return to Word Processing Program <b>34</b> to repeat a loop defined thereby, or to go to the Shell <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>Other Stored Model Financial Document <b>37</b> represents other financial documentation required to successfully place the securitized components. For each component, these include at least one securities document, e.g., one or more of the following group: an organizational document for an entity such that a certificate evidencing an ownership or equity interest in the entity is a security, a security evidencing an ownership or equity interest in such an entity, and a disclosure document for securities law purposes, such as an offering memorandum, prospectus, or term sheet, which would normally include some or all of the following.</p>
    <p>Security Description</p>
    <p>Property Description and Legal Description</p>
    <p>Lease Synopsis and Lease Agreement</p>
    <p>Description of Tenant(s)</p>
    <p>Business</p>
    <p>Financial Assessments</p>
    <p>Financial Analysis Based Upon Various Assumptions and Inputs</p>
    <p>Presentation of Risk Characteristics</p>
    <p>In this description, the term “securities law” can refer to United States federal securities law alone or to all applicable United States federal, state and territorial securities law.</p>
    <p>A portion of the Financial Analysis Output <b>24</b> is presented in Screens <b>2</b>-<b>4</b> of Specimen 2, which is a simplification over the use of a dedicated program to generate the Financial Analysis Output <b>26</b> after all of the Input Data <b>18</b> has been entered.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 4, the input and computational logic of a preferred embodiment of Logic Means <b>30</b> is detailed. The logic of Input Date A <b>70</b> receives entry of the date on which a separated purchase transaction is to take place, and Input Date B <b>72</b> receives entry of the expiration date for the estate for years. The transaction date and the estate for years expiration date should be entered as numbers, i.e., the number of the month, the number of the day, so that the length of the period between the two dates can be easily computed in Compute Estate For Years Term <b>74</b>. Block <b>74</b> computes the number of whole and fractional months in the estate for years term, both as an output and for use elsewhere in the logic in computing discounted presented values and the schedules of annual and quarterly depreciation and amortization deductions, as discussed subsequently.</p>
    <p>Usually, the end of the estate for years term will be on the last day of a calendar month, and the transaction date will be on the first or last day of a calendar month. Thus Block <b>72</b> stores the number of days in any fractional calendar month at the beginning or end of the term, if any, separately from, and in addition to, the length of the term (i.e., Block <b>72</b> keeps the number of days in beginning and end fractional calendar months separate from each other). By subtracting the separated purchase date from the expiration date of the estate for years, the Logic Means <b>30</b> can be used to compute the length of the estate for years term (e.g., “10 years”, “9 years 8 months”, or “9 years 10 months 11 days”).</p>
    <p>The Logic Means <b>30</b> also includes Input Treasury Bond Yield Rates <b>76</b> and Input Rental Income Risk Rates <b>78</b> for respectively receiving entry of the Treasury bond yield curve and the rental risk premium curve as a function of the yield curve. The output of Block <b>91</b>, which is only slightly sensitive to changes in position on the yield curve, is used interactively to select the appropriate Treasury bond rate and rental income risk premium.</p>
    <p>The data entered in Blocks <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> are used in Compute Rental Income Rate <b>80</b>, which adds the data to compute the rental income yield rate, which is the discount rate used to value the pretax net rental payment cash flows. Rather than treating the value as an input, the Logic Means <b>30</b> has the user input the corresponding Treasury bond yield rate and the rental income risk premium appropriate for the tenant credit ratings. The rental income yield rate is computed in Block <b>80</b> as the sum of the Treasury bond yield rate and the rental risk premium.</p>
    <p>The Logic Means <b>30</b> also has Tax Bracket <b>82</b> for receiving input data representing the tax bracket of the estate for years purchaser. The estate for years purchaser will usually be a taxable investor, in order to take advantage of the tax deductions associated with ownership of the estate for years asset. The Logic Means <b>30</b> computes the after-tax income yield rate, (i.e., the marginal after-tax interest rate the estate for years investor receives on income from senior debentures of the same default risk as the estate for years) in Block <b>84</b>. The computation is the product of the pretax interest rate on those debentures (obtained from Block <b>80</b>) multiplied by one minus the tax bracket of the estate for years purchaser (obtained from Block <b>80</b>).</p>
    <p>Input Gross Rental Payment <b>85</b>, which is applicable for non-triple net leases, receives the projected gross rental payment. Input Property-Related Ownership Costs <b>87</b>, which is also applicable for non-triple net leases, receives the projected ownership costs. Input Wrap Insurance Costs <b>89</b> is actually a part of Input Block <b>87</b> in the case of non-triple net leases, but is broken out and made a separate input in the case of triple-net leases that are not bondable. This is the schedule of insurance payments for the wrap insurance policies needed to upgrade a non-bondable triple-net lease to bondable status.</p>
    <p>Compute Scheduled Net Rental Payments <b>88</b> receives the data input in Blocks <b>85</b>, <b>87</b>, and <b>89</b> to compute net rental payments during the estate for years term, as mentioned above. However, for triple-net leases, Block <b>88</b> can be an input of net rental payments, with Blocks <b>85</b> and <b>87</b> unnecessary, and Block <b>89</b> optional or unnecessary: (1) unnecessary in the case of bondable triple-net leases; and (2) optional for other triple-net leases, depending on whether or not insurance to upgrade the triple-net lease to bondable status is cost-effective. If the user selects to enter the monthly rental payments manually, the Logic Means presents Screen <b>54</b> with the aforementioned two columns: a list of the calendar months in the estate for years term (beginning with the month that includes the transaction date, and ending with the month that includes the expiration date of the estate for years security) on the left, and corresponding spaces for rental payments on the right. Alternatively, in the (typically occurring) cases of leases which have constant net rental payments, or for which the term can be divided into a small number of subterms during each of which the net rental payments are constant, the various net rents and the periods to which they apply may be entered in lieu of a month-by-month net rent schedule.</p>
    <p>The data input in Block <b>88</b> is used in Compute Estate for Years Purchase Price <b>90</b>. The estate for years purchase price, which is implied by the rental income yield rate, is the discounted present value of the net scheduled rental payments, valued at the rental income yield rate computed in Block <b>80</b>. If the transaction date is the first day of a calendar month, and the estate for years term consists of a whole number of months, then Formula 1 gives this value. <maths> <math overflow="scroll"> <mtable> <mtr> <mtd> <mrow> <mrow> <mrow> <mi>Estate</mi> <mo></mo> <mstyle> <mtext> </mtext> </mstyle> <mo></mo> <mi>for</mi> <mo></mo> <mstyle> <mtext> </mtext> </mstyle> <mo></mo> <mi>Years</mi> <mo></mo> <mstyle> <mtext> </mtext> </mstyle> <mo></mo> <mi>Purchase</mi> <mo></mo> <mstyle> <mtext> </mtext> </mstyle> <mo></mo> <mi>Price</mi> </mrow> <mo>=</mo> <mrow> <munderover> <mo>∑</mo> <mrow> <mi>j</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> <mi>N</mi> </munderover> <mo></mo> <mfrac> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mi>rent</mi> <mo></mo> <mstyle> <mtext> </mtext> </mstyle> <mo></mo> <mi>in</mi> <mo></mo> <mstyle> <mtext> </mtext> </mstyle> <mo></mo> <mi>jth</mi> <mo></mo> <mstyle> <mtext> </mtext> </mstyle> <mo></mo> <mi>month</mi> </mrow> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <msup> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mn>1</mn> <mo>+</mo> <mrow> <mi>r</mi> <mo>/</mo> <mn>12</mn> </mrow> </mrow> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>j</mi> <mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msup> </mfrac> </mrow> </mrow> <mo>,</mo> </mrow> </mtd> <mtd> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mn>1</mn> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mtd> </mtr> </mtable> </math> <div class="patent-image small-patent-image"> <a href="//patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US6192347B1/US06192347-20010220-M00001.png"> <img id="EMI-M00001" file="US06192347-20010220-M00001.TIF" img-content="math" img-format="tif" src="//patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US6192347B1/US06192347-20010220-M00001.png" class="patent-full-image" alt="Figure US06192347-20010220-M00001"> </a> </div> <attachments> <attachment idref="MATHEMATICA-00001" attachment-type="nb" file="US06192347-20010220-M00001.NB"> </attachment> </attachments> </maths> </p>
    <p>where r=the annual rental income yield rate, and N=the number of months in the estate for years term.</p>
    <p>The data input for Block <b>90</b> together with the output of Block <b>90</b> is used in Block <b>91</b> to compute the weighted average life, half life, and duration, for the Estate for Years. One or more of these values—the weighted average is currently the preferred choice—is typically used by investors to determine which value on the Treasury yield curve is the most suitable choice for input through Block <b>76</b>. Because these values only vary by relatively small amounts as the inputs from Blocks <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> are varied, rough estimates of the correct place on the yield curve can be used for these inputs, with the output of Block <b>91</b> then used iteratively to correct the original estimates; alternatively, the iterative loop can be omitted, and instead performed manually by the user to select among candidate yield curve values and converge interactively to the appropriate place on the yield curve based upon the output of Block <b>91</b>. If the manual mode is employed, one, two or at most three, iterations will be required to converge to the correct yield curve value.</p>
    <p>The Logic Means <b>30</b> additionally has Input Property Valuation <b>92</b> for receiving input data representing a property valuation of the real estate; Input Extra Fees <b>94</b> is for receiving input data representing fees and expenses incurred in structuring the separated purchase transaction. The securitization and separation of a property into components often entails greater costs than a traditional real estate sale. Those investing in the components are willing to pay the additional cost because, after a split purchase, the combined values of the two components is greater than the value of the real estate before the purchase as shown in FIG. 1, due to additional tax deductions available after the real estate interests have been divided.</p>
    <p>The gross property sale price is computed in Property Sale Price <b>96</b> as the sum of the value of the undivided property (from Block <b>92</b>) and the incremental expenses required to split the real estate into components (from Block <b>94</b>). Expenses beyond those required in a conventional real estate transaction are considered here.</p>
    <p>Compute Cap Rate <b>98</b> computes a rather crude indicator of the return on the investment. The cap rate is computed by dividing the total first year rent (from Block <b>88</b>) by the gross property sale price of the undivided property (from Block <b>96</b>).</p>
    <p>Remainder Interest Purchase Price <b>100</b> computes the remainder interest purchase price as whatever amount in addition to the estate for years purchase price is required to put together the price required to purchase the real estate. This value is computed by subtracting the estate for years purchase price (from Block <b>90</b>) from the gross property sale price (from Block <b>96</b>).</p>
    <p>Remainder Interest Implied Annual Return <b>102</b> computes the remainder interest component implied annual return, which is the annualized return the remainder interest investor will have earned if the value of the property when the estate for years expires is determined by multiplying Input Future Remainder Value <b>73</b> by Input Property Valuation <b>92</b>. Input Future Remainder Value <b>73</b> is the expected remainder value at the end of the estate for years term, expressed as percentage of Input Property Valuation <b>92</b>. In the case of institutional grade real estate, the input value received by Input Future Remainder Value <b>73</b> will frequently be close or equal to 100%, reflecting the frequently applicable assumption that the value of the decomposed property is expected to change little or not at all across the estate for years term.</p>
    <p>This interest rate is the only unknown quantity in Formula 2, which is set forth below.</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text>Expected Property Valuation=(Remainder Component Purchase Price) (1+<i>x</i>)<sup>[N/12]</sup>(1+(<i>N/</i>12−[<i>N/</i>12])<i>x</i>)  (2) </formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>where Expected Property Valuation is the product of Input Future Remainder Value <b>73</b> and Input Property Valuation <b>92</b>, N=number of months in the estate for years term, [N/12]=the largest integer that is less than or equal to N/12, and x=remainder component implied annual return.</p>
    <p>Input Rental Area <b>104</b> is for receiving data input representing the rentable area in the real estate. This data is used in Remainder Price Per Square Foot <b>106</b> to compute the remainder price per square foot, which is computed by dividing the remainder interest purchase price (from Block <b>100</b>) by the number of rentable square feet in the property (from Block <b>104</b>).</p>
    <p>Input Zero-Coupon Risk-Free Rate <b>108</b> is for receiving data input representing the zero-coupon risk-free rate. Then, in Block <b>110</b>, the price per square foot that the remainder interest buyer is paying at the time the remainder interest matures into full ownership of the property is computed as equaling the amount to which the remainder price per square foot increases when it accrues interest at the zero-coupon risk-free rate. Formula 3 is used to compute this value.</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text>Price/Sq. Ft.=(Remainder Price/Sq. Ft.) (1+zero-coupon risk-free rate)<sup>[N/12]</sup>(1+(<i>N/</i>12−[<i>N/</i>12])(zero-coupon risk-free rate))  (3) </formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>where N=number of months in the estate for years term, and [N/12]=the largest integer that is less than or equal to N/12.</p>
    <p>Although this is the correct formula for a comparison of remainder interest prices at the beginning and end of the estate for years term in an arbitrage-free market, is the remainder interest investor may find it more instructive to transforming this equation into a capital budgeting relation by substituting the remainder interest investor's opportunity cost of equity or debt capital for the risk-free rate.</p>
    <p>Percentage of Property Value Not Depreciable <b>112</b> is for receiving input data representing a percentage of property value represented, in the case of real estate, by the land. If a conservative cost recovery position is taken by the estate for years investor and only amortization is claimed as a tax deduction, which is the likeliest scenario at the current time, then this input is unnecessary. If depreciation as well as amortization is claimed by the estate for years holder, then this value is used in Block <b>114</b> to compute the schedule of depreciation and amortization tax deductions, together with the resulting adjustments to the estate for years tax basis. These must be computed very carefully because if both deductions are claimed then the deductions are not completely independent of each other, and because the interaction is complex and subtle.</p>
    <p>Under present tax law, during the estate for years term, the estate for years is entitled at least to a deduction computed by straight line amortization of the estate for years acquisition cost, and possibly depreciation deductions as well, with reductions in each end-of-year tax basis computed in accordance with established tax accounting principles.</p>
    <p>After computing the values of these annual deductions, the investor allocates fractions of the deductions to each tax quarter as instructed in the present tax code (e.g., if the first year is the entire calendar year, one quarter of each deduction is allocated to each quarter), and the tax basis is reduced accordingly on a quarterly basis.</p>
    <p>The quarter-by-quarter amortization and depreciation deductions, and the corresponding quarterly adjustments to the estate for years tax basis, will be entered into a preformatted table. This table will be available for viewing on the Monitor <b>20</b>, can be stored with the other output data if saved in Data File <b>32</b> by the user of Computer System <b>12</b>, and can be printed at Printer <b>22</b> if the user presses a designated key on the Keyboard <b>16</b>. (It should be noted that this invention uses the tax code, whatever it may require, in decomposing the real estate into separate components; the invention of the computer system and methods involving it of course do not depend upon the present tax laws.)</p>
    <p>Block <b>116</b> computes quarterly tax payments by subtracting the quarterly tax deductions from the quarterly net rental payments, and multiplying the result by the tax bracket of the estate for years investor. This is output since it is part of the accounting support for the estate for years investor.</p>
    <p>Typically, tax payments are made by institutional investors four times per year, in the middle of months 1, 4, 7, and 10. The after-tax income component yield, which is computed in Block <b>118</b>, is the after-tax yield to the estate for years buyer, and is the internal rate of return on the after-tax net rental cash flows. For rental payments made at the beginning of each month, it is preferred to divide the year into twenty-four (24) semi-monthly periods with cash flows at the beginning of each period. With this approach, the pretax rents are the cash flows in the odd-numbered periods (i.e., periods 1, 3, 5, . . . , 21, 23), while the tax payments are the cash flows in periods 2, 8, 14, 20 (in the other even-numbered periods, the cash flows are treated as being equal to zero).</p>
    <p>An alternative is to simplify the calculation conceptually for the estate for years holder by assuming that tax deductions occur with the same frequency as the cash flows (typically, on a monthly basis), and matching the occurrence of the tax deductions with the corresponding cash flows. In this case, for computational purposes the year will be divided into the same number of periods as the expected frequency of cash flows—typically, twelve periods, or monthly.</p>
    <p>In Pretax Income Component Yield <b>120</b>, the pretax income component yield is computed as the pretax interest rate that the estate for years buyer would have to receive if the estate for years were a bond, in order to be left with the same amount of after-tax income that results from owning the estate for years. This number is computed by dividing the after-tax income component yield (from Block <b>118</b>) by one minus the tax bracket of the estate for years investor (from Block <b>82</b>).</p>
    <p>If the estate for years purchaser is a taxable investor, this number will be larger than the rental income yield rate of Block <b>80</b>. This occurs because the estate for years is an income-producing asset rather than a bond, and hence income from the estate for years is subject to different tax regulations than income from a bond.</p>
    <p>Block <b>122</b> computes the equivalent after-tax estate for years value by discounting the after-tax net rental payments at the after-tax income yield rate. This is the discount rate that would be applied to the after-tax cash flows if the estate for years were a bond.</p>
    <p>Block <b>122</b> may compute other measures of the estate for years value by discounting different components of the after-tax cash flows at different discount rates that reflect the different risk characteristics of those components (e.g., discounting the pretax cash flows, tax payments, and tax deductions at rates that reflect the different degrees of certainty that they will be realized as projected at the time of component separation).</p>
    <p>In cases in which the remainder component is to be decomposed into a preferred fixed-income interest and a residual equity interest, Input Credit Risk Premium Curve <b>105</b> receives the credit risk premium curve of the insurer for the preferred interest. Input Extra Months to Retire Preferred <b>103</b> receives the amount of time beyond the estate for years term, if any, that the residual equity interest investor has to refinance or sell the property and pay off the preferred interest holder. Average Life <b>95</b> computes the expected life of the preferred interest in the remainder component by adding the estate for years term to the value received by Input Extra Months to Retire Preferred <b>103</b>, which equals the average life of the preferred interest since the preferred interest is a zero-coupon bond. Preferred Interest Annual Return <b>97</b> selects the Treasury bond yield rate from Input Data <b>78</b> and corresponding insurance credit risk premium from Input Data <b>105</b> corresponding to the preferred equity interest average life, and computes the preferred interest annual return by adding the Treasury bond yield rate to the insurance credit risk premium.</p>
    <p>Input Insured Property Value <b>101</b> receives the insured value for the property at a date specified by the residual value insurance (e.g., at maturity of the preferred interest), expressed as a percentage of Input Property Valuation <b>92</b>. Preferred Interest Purchase Price <b>99</b> converts the insured value for the property to a nominal amount by multiplying Input <b>101</b> and Input <b>92</b> together, and then computes the preferred interest purchase price by discounting the insured property value at maturity of the preferred interest back to the date of the temporal decomposition by the equation:</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text>Preferred Interest Purchase Price Insured Property Value/((1+<i>y</i>)<sup>[M/12]</sup>(1+(<i>M/</i>12−[<i>M/</i>12])<i>y</i>)  (4) </formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>where y=preferred interest annual return, and M=number of months in the expected life of the preferred interest.</p>
    <p>The cost of decomposing the remainder component into preferred and residual interests is computed in Residual Interest Purchase Price <b>113</b> as the sum of the cost of residual value insurance from Input Insurance Policy Premium <b>107</b> and any additional associated up-front fees from Input Additional Up-Front Fees <b>109</b>, such as the costs of obtaining a credit rating for the preferred interest and of generating financial disclosure documents for the preferred and residual interests. Residual Interest Purchase Price <b>113</b> then computes the residual interest purchase price from the equation that the sum of the preferred interest and residual interest purchase prices is equal to the sum of the purchase price of the remainder component from Remainder Interest Purchase Price <b>100</b> and the cost of decomposing the remainder component into the preferred and residual interests. This is a linear equation in which the only unknown quantity is the purchase price of the residual interest, which implies that the equation can be solved for the residual interest purchase price as follows:</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text>Residual Interest Purchase Price=Remainder Component Purchase Price+Residual Value Insurance Policy Premium+Additional Up-Front Fees−Preferred Interest Purchase Price  (5) </formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>In some exceptional cases, it may be desirable to use a fraction of the residual value insurance to insure the return on the preferred interest, reserving the remaining fraction of the residual value insurance to insure a portion of the return on the residual interest. This can lower the investment risk associated with the residual interest, enhancing the marketability of the residual interest by sacrificing some residual interest leverage. In such cases, the expression on the right side of Equation (4) for the preferred interest purchase price must be modified as follows: the right side of the equation must be multiplied by the fraction that represents the portion of residual value insurance that is allocated to insurance for the preferred interest return. Equation (5) still provides the solution for the residual interest purchase price in terms of the preferred interest purchase price.</p>
    <p>Input Exit Fees <b>111</b> receives the expected future cost of liquidating or refinancing the remainder interest in order to raise the funds required to retire the preferred interest, which cost is expressed as a percentage of the expected property valuation at maturity computed in Block <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p>Residual Interest Annual Return <b>115</b> computes the expected annual return on the residual interest over the expected life of the preferred/residual decomposition. This interest rate is the only unknown quantity in the following equation:</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text>Expected Residual Interest Valuation at Maturity=(Residual Interest Purchase Price) (1+<i>z</i>)<sup>[M/12]</sup>(1+(<i>M/</i>12−[<i>M/</i>12])<i>z</i>)  (6) </formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>where Expected Residual Interest Valuation at Maturity is the value obtained by subtracting the sum of the preferred interest valuation at maturity and the expected nominal amount of exit fees from the expected property valuation at maturity from Block <b>102</b>, z=residual interest annual return, and M=number of months in the expected life of the preferred interest. The preferred interest valuation at maturity equals the value of the portion of the minimum property value specified by the residual value insurance that is allocated to the preferred interest, which portion usually is equal to the entire amount of the specified minimum property value. The expected nominal amount of exit fees is obtained by multiplying the percentage value from Input Exit Fees <b>111</b> by the nominal value of the expected property valuation at maturity.</p>
    <p>Remainder-to-Residual Ratio <b>119</b> divides the remainder interest valuation by the residual interest valuation. This represents the factor by which the amount of equity risk capital required to complete the acquisition and decomposition of the property is reduced via the use of residual value insurance to carve a fixed-income preferred interest out of the remainder component.</p>
    <p>Residual Leverage Ratio <b>121</b> computes the factor by which leverage for the equity investor is increased (for the case of the scenario specified by the input values) by carving a preferred fixed-income interest out of the remainder component. This is computed by the following equation:</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text>Residual Leverage Ratio=(Remainder-to-Residual Ratio) (Expected Residual Valuation at Maturity/Expected Property Valuation)  (7) </formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>where Remainder-to-Residual Ratio is obtained from Block <b>119</b>, Expected Residual Valuation at Maturity is obtained from Block <b>115</b>, and Expected Property Valuation is obtained from Block <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p>In Blocks <b>115</b> and <b>121</b>, the residual interest annual return and the residual leverage ratio are computed net of fees associated with raising the funds required to retire the preferred interest. This is a financially conservative approach to the computation of these values and differs from the approach frequently taken in disclosure documents, which is to compute returns and leverage ratios based on asset values before imposition of any back-end liquidation or refinancing fees. It is important to note that the alternative values for the residual annual return and residual leverage ratio before imposition of back-end fees are also generated by this software, by setting Input Exit Fees <b>111</b> equal to zero.</p>
    <p>By contrast, the incorporation of an assumed exit fee at the end of the estate for years term in Remainder Interest Implied Annual Return <b>102</b> and the expected property valuation input to Residual Leverage Ratio <b>121</b> is usually inappropriate in the case of a remainder interest that is not leveraged or decomposed into components, since in this case the remainder interest holder usually does not face an automatic need to refinance the property at the end of the estate for years term. In cases in which the remainder holder is expected to face such a need, expected exit fees can be subtracted from Input Future Remainder Value <b>73</b> either before or after data entry. This modification will flow through automatically to make appropriate modifications for expected remainder holder exit fees to the calculations for Remainder Interest Implied Annual Return <b>102</b> and Residual Leverage Ratio <b>121</b>.</p>
    <p>Insured Value Per Unit Area <b>125</b> computes the insured value of the property per unit area of rentable space by multiplying the property valuation from Input Property Valuation <b>92</b> by the insured value for the property from Input Insured Property Value <b>101</b> (as specified at maturity of the preferred interest by the residual value insurance and expressed as a percentage of Input Property Valuation <b>92</b>) and dividing the resulting product by the rentable area of the property, usually in square feet, received from Input Rental Area <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p>In using Computer System <b>12</b> and the Financial Analysis Output <b>26</b>, the user of Computer System <b>12</b> can construct financial documents by using a Word Processing Program <b>34</b> to revise such documents as those in Specimen 2 and Specimen 3 and the Stored Other Financial Document <b>37</b>. These documents contain other terms and conditions and other particulars for the separated purchase transaction of the components of the real estate, in accordance with the present invention.</p>
    <heading>D. Computer Screens and Logic For Another Embodiment</heading> <p>In another embodiment of the present invention, the Logic Means <b>30</b>, in conjunction with the rest of System <b>12</b>, is used in connection with financial transactions involving separate components of one or more partnership interests in tax-exempt securities.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, Logic Means <b>30</b> partially automates the dividing of the partnership interest into respective, valued interests for the estate for years and the remainder interest. Computation of the values is based on fixed-income pricing techniques widely accepted by fixed-income investors.</p>
    <p>In this other embodiment of the invention, the hardware, logic, and computer screens are as described above, with modifications to reflect the different kind of property being divided. Reflecting these modifications, Data Form <b>52</b>, of which Screen <b>1</b> of Specimen 2 is an example, accepts inputs for a tax-exempt security with constant debt service payments.</p>
    <p>The user enters or edits a column of debt service payments (instead of the rents in the above-mentioned embodiment) until all payments have been entered.</p>
    <p>Other Stored Model Financial Document <b>37</b> represents other financial documentation required to successfully place the securitized components. For each component, these include a securities document, e.g., one or more of the following group: an organizational document for an entity such that a certificate evidencing an ownership or equity interest in the entity is deemed a security for securities law purposes, a security evidencing an ownership or equity interest in such an entity, and a disclosure document for securities law purposes, such as an offering memorandum, prospectus, or term sheet, which would normally include some or all of the following:</p>
    <p>Security Description</p>
    <p>Entity Description</p>
    <p>Tax-Exempt Fixed-Income Security(ies) Held by Entity (Description)</p>
    <p>Description of Borrower(s) Financial Assessments</p>
    <p>Financial Analysis Based Upon Various Assumptions and Inputs</p>
    <p>Presentation of Risk Characteristics</p>
    <p>In this description, the term “securities law” can refer either to United States federal securities law alone or to all applicable United States federal, state and territorial securities law.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 represents the input and computational logic of this embodiment of Logic Means <b>30</b>, which again is substantially as discussed in the above-mentioned embodiment. The pricing logic for components is analogous to the pricing of the estate for years in the case of tansible property. However, unlike the application of this invention to tansible property, every financial asset in the present embodiment—the original asset together with all components—is treated as a fixed-income asset, and is valued via fixed-income technology.</p>
    <p>Values can be expressed, and computations performed, in absolute terms of a currency unit such as dollars, or in relative terms such as percentages of current value or original issue value of the tax-exempt securities in the partnership portfolio of interest. While all contracts ultimately require values to be expressed in absolute terms, comparisons of profitability are more easily made in relative terms. Specimen 2 illustrates both modes of expression for System <b>12</b> input and output.</p>
    <p>To simplify the language in what follows, the remaining discussion will refer to “securities” in the singular only, i.e., “security;” however, it will be understood that the discussion applies both to single-security portfolios and multiple security portfolios held by the partnership. Where possible, the discussion will simply refer to the security as the “partnership portfolio.” Similarly, the term “investor,” when applied to the holders of estate for years and remainder components, is intended to refer to both the singular and plural cases.</p>
    <p>The logic of Input Data <b>124</b> receives a schedule of interest rates for AAA publicly traded general obligation municipal bonds of annual maturities from one to thirty-five years. This serves as the analogue of the yield curve for the tax-exempt bond market, i.e., the basis for pricing all other tax-exempt securities, and this input is used by each pricing calculation herein. Input Data <b>126</b> receives a schedule of additional interest investors expect for holding a type of tax-exempt portfolio held by a limited partnership. Block <b>136</b> roughly estimates a remaining average life of the partnership portfolio, selects the corresponding AAA general obligation rate and risk premium, and adds them to obtain the current yield required by the fixed-income market for the partnership portfolio.</p>
    <p>Input Data <b>132</b> receives the schedule of payments expected from the partnership portfolio. This will usually be in the form of a file specifying payment values and dates. However, in some cases an alternate description may be appropriate. For example, in the case of a single-security portfolio with constant debt service, the specification of principal value, frequency of payments, and amortization term constitutes a description from which, together with the yield rate from Input Data <b>134</b>, a schedule of debt service payments may be reconstructed.</p>
    <p>Using data received by Input Data Blocks <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>, Block <b>142</b> extracts a schedule of remaining cash flows expected from the partnership portfolio, and computes a present value by discounting the cash flows at the rate received from Block <b>136</b>. Based on this present value, an improved estimate of the average life of the portfolio is computed by Block <b>140</b>.</p>
    <p>Block <b>136</b> uses this improved estimate iteratively to recompute the current portfolio yield, and the recomputed portfolio yield is used by Blocks <b>142</b> and <b>140</b> to recompute the portfolio value and average life, respectively. As discussed earlier, average life is relatively insensitive to changes in the discount rate, so one or two iterations is almost always sufficient to obtain consistent output values that will not change with additional iterations.</p>
    <p>This linked iteration is used four more times in the logic of Logic Means <b>30</b>: in the calculations of discount rate, and the price, and the average lives of the estate for years and the remainder. The other examples are virtually identical, and will not be discussed separately.</p>
    <p>Box <b>146</b> receives a percentage of the partnership that will be separated into estate for years and remainder components, and Box <b>148</b> computes a complementary value of the partnership that will not be separated into components. It is possible that several partnership interests will be separated into components, and that various estate for years components will have distinct terms; however, typically there will be only one partnership interest that will be separated into components, and it will be the entire limited partnership interest. Consequently, the “term” of the estate for years is clear because usually there is only one estate for years. However, the invention is intended to include the more general case of multiple component separations as well.</p>
    <p>The choice of partnership percentage that will be separated into components as an input is arbitrary, at least in the case in which one component is separated into components. It is equally acceptable to input the partnership percentage that will not be separated into components, and to output the percentage of the partnership that will be separated into components.</p>
    <p>Block <b>148</b> receives the schedule of partnership cash flows that will be received after the date the components are separated and decomposes the cash flows into interest and repayment of principal portions, using the original interest rate at which the security was issued (from Input Data <b>134</b>). These distinctions are important in valuing the components because, under current federal tax law, only the interest portion of each payment is automatically tax-exempt; the repayment of principal portion is sheltered from federal taxation only to the extent that cost recovery deductions generated by the security are available to the security holder(s).</p>
    <p>It will frequently be the case that the original tax-exempt interest rate received by Input Data <b>134</b> equals the current tax-exempt yield rate computed by Block <b>136</b>. One natural way for this to occur is if the tax-exempt security in the partnership portfolio is created at the same time as the estate for years and remainder components. In this case, the embodiment of the invention defined herein will generate documentation for the tax-exempt security as well as documentation for the estate for years and remainder components.</p>
    <p>Block <b>152</b> multiplies the payment schedules for interest and repayment of principal by the percentage of the partnership that will be separated into components to compute schedules for interest payments and repayment of principal payments that will be split between the components.</p>
    <p>The length of the estate for years term received by Input Data <b>150</b> is used by Blocks <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> to split the schedules of interest and repayment of principal payments into schedules of payments that will be received by the estate for years is investor and the remainder investor, respectively.</p>
    <p>Block <b>158</b> receives the schedule of risk premium values for a security of the type represented by the estate for years. The estate for years risk premium schedule is related to the partnership portfolio risk premium schedule, but may differ due to different investor perceptions of risk in the two types of investments. While credit risk for the estate for years is the same as credit risk for the partnership portfolio, liquidity risk may be different. The liquidity risk will be increased if the estate for years is viewed as more difficult to sell prior to maturity than the partnership portfolio, as will be the case before this product is well-established in the fixed-income marketplace. But the liquidity risk will also lessen because the average life of the estate for years is shorter than the average life of the partnership portfolio. The combined effect on liquidity risk as perceived by investors is difficult to predict, and may have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    <p>The estate for years risk premium may also contain a component due to perceived tax risk, i.e., the risk that not all of the predicted incremental tax benefits associated with the estate for years will be received by the estate for years investor. This risk may be substantial in some cases, and nonexistent in others. For example, if the estate for years component carries insurance against loss of economic benefits due to a change in the tax laws, the estate for years investor would not be expected to demand additional return for tax risk, because this investor is not exposed to any risk of economic loss as a consequence of this risk dimension.</p>
    <p>For marketing purposes, the estate for years component may disburse cash payments according to a different schedule than the partnership portfolio. For example, the partnership portfolio may receive payments monthly, or at irregular intervals (e.g., if the portfolio contains several securities), whereas the estate for years makes disbursements semiannually. Input Data <b>160</b> receives the frequency of estate for years cash disbursements, and Input Data <b>162</b> receives the tax-exempt interest rate the general partner(s) guarantee to accrue on warehoused payments from the partnership portfolio, usually from a tax-exempt money market fund.</p>
    <p>Block <b>166</b> computes the cash payment schedule of the estate for years component. Each payment is computed by adding together the portion of the partnership portfolio disbursements warehoused for the estate for years investor since the last disbursement, and adding to that the interest accrued on the warehoused payments.</p>
    <p>Block <b>164</b> computes the estate for years yield rate as in the case of the partnership portfolio yield rate (cf. Block <b>136</b>).</p>
    <p>Block <b>174</b> computes the estate for years purchase price by discounting the cash flows from Block <b>168</b>. In general, this computation is an interactive process. First, Block <b>170</b> discounts the aftertax estate for years cash flows at the estate for years yield rate computed by Block <b>164</b>. This discounts all of the interest portions of the cash flows, but assumes that repayment of principal portions are reduced by tax payments before discounting, where tax payments are computed using the projected tax rates from Input Data <b>162</b>.</p>
    <p>Next a schedule of estate for years amortization deductions is computed in Block <b>182</b>, a present value of amortization deductions is computed by Block <b>184</b>, and an updated iterate for the estate for years purchase price is computed by summing the output of Blocks <b>170</b> and <b>184</b>. Then the loop is repeated as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>(B), until the computed value of the estate for years purchase price ceases to change significantly with additional iterations.</p>
    <p>The projected tax schedule of the estate for years purchaser received from Input Data <b>168</b> is essential to the valuation of amortization of tax deductions in Block <b>184</b>. If the estate for years purchaser were assumed to be a tax-exempt investor, the present value of the tax deductions would be zero. This reveals an important point: as with conventional tax-exempt securities, the estate for years component is worth more to a taxable investor than to a tax-exempt investor. Furthermore, as the tax bracket of the estate for years investor increases, so does the value of the estate for years component.</p>
    <p>Typically, the projected tax rate schedule received from Input Data <b>168</b> will consist of a single tax rate, and some implementations of Logic Means <b>30</b> will make this simplification.</p>
    <p>It is not always necessary to compute the value of the estate for years component iteratively. If the cash flows from the partnership portfolio are sufficiently regular, for example if debt service payments do not vary and are made at regular intervals (e.g., as is the case for a single-security partnership portfolio with constant debt service payments, and possibly a balloon payment at maturity), then computation of the estate for years purchase price in Block <b>174</b> is made via an analytic formula without Block <b>170</b> and without iterative computations.</p>
    <p>The output of Block <b>174</b> shows the value of applying the innovation to tax-exempt securities. The estate for years component generates amortization deductions to shelter a portion of the cash flows received by the estate for years component from taxes. However, because the partnership portfolio is tax-exempt, portions of the cash flows attributed to interest are already tax-exempt. For cases in which tax-exempt interest represents a sufficiently large part of estate for years cash flow, estate for years amortization deductions will be greater than needed to shelter the repayment of principal portions of estate for years cash flows from taxes. These excess amortization deductions can be used to reduce taxes on disbursements from (other) taxable investments, which implies that the estate for years value is greater than the value of the estate for years cash flows alone.</p>
    <p>The incremental value represented by excess amortization deductions is computed in Block <b>176</b>, which subtracts the value of the tax-exempt estate for years cash flows computed in Block <b>172</b> from the estate for years purchase price computed in Block <b>174</b>. Block <b>176</b> reveals the business/economic value created by the application of component separation to tax-exempt securities. This invention is not tied to any particular amortization or cost recovery schedule for the estate for years, as long as the contribution of the present value of tax deductions generated by the estate for years component enhances the estate for years value relative to its value as a schedule of tax-exempt cash flows.</p>
    <p>Block <b>178</b> computes the implied yield on the estate for years component based on cash flow alone. This is an important safety check on the validity of the estate for years amortization deductions, because under current tax law deductions are invalid if they create an asset with negative or zero expected investment return. Because the estate for years is a fixed-income asset, implied yield to maturity based on cash flow alone equals expected investment return. Thus the output of Block <b>178</b> must be greater than zero for the prices computed by the invention to be valid.</p>
    <p>Block <b>180</b> computes the average life, half life, and duration of the estate for years using the full schedule of estate for years cash flows plus projected tax savings. This output is used in the iterative calculation of the estate for years yield rate as in the previous examples of this process.</p>
    <p>Computation of the remainder component price entails a complication not present in computing the estate for years price, due to the fact that is a zero-coupon security, i.e., due to the fact that no cash flow is generated during the estate for years term. Consequently, the tax basis of the remainder component will never be large enough to tax shelter all of the return of principal payments received by the remainder, so that a portion of the cash flows received by the remainder investor is subject to federal taxation.</p>
    <p>This implies that the remainder component can be valued in at least two ways: (1) as a tax-exempt security, on the basis of its aftertax cash flows; or (2) a conventional taxable security, valued on the basis of its pretax cash flows. In case (1), the projected tax rate schedule of the purchaser affects the computation of the purchase price, whereas in case (2), the purchase price computation is independent of the tax bracket of the purchaser. Logic Means <b>30</b> computes the remainder value as a tax-exempt security in Block <b>198</b>, and the remainder value as a taxable security in Block <b>212</b>. Logic Means <b>30</b> selects the larger value in Block <b>214</b>, and outputs a recommendation as to the appropriate marketing strategy, i.e., whether to market the remainder as a tax-exempt fixed-income security or a taxable fixed-income security.</p>
    <p>As a longer term zero-coupon investment, the regularity or irregularity of remainder cash flows has little to do with asset marketability. Because there is little to gain by rescheduling the remainder cash flows via cash flow warehousing, this degree of complexity is omitted from the structure of the remainder component by the logic means.</p>
    <p>Block <b>190</b> computes the yield rate for the remainder under the assumption that it is regarded as a tax-exempt security.</p>
    <p>The computation of the remainder price in Block <b>198</b> proceeds iteratively exactly as in the case of the estate for years, substituting Block <b>192</b> for Block <b>170</b>, Block <b>206</b> for Block <b>182</b>, and Block <b>208</b> for Block <b>184</b>. Also, again as with computation of the estate for years purchase price, the iterations can be avoided and replaced by an analytic formula for the tax-exempt remainder purchase price if the remainder cash flows are assumed to be sufficiently regular.</p>
    <p>The computation of the average life of a fixed-income security is based on pretax cash flows and pretax interest rate. Block <b>196</b> computes the implied pretax remainder interest rate. This value is identical to the tax-exempt yield rate computed by Block <b>190</b> if the tax rate schedule from Input Data <b>188</b> is zero, and in general the value computed by Block <b>196</b> differs only slightly from the tax-exempt yield rate. The interest rate computed by Block <b>196</b> together with the pretax cash flows and the tax-exempt remainder purchase price from Block <b>198</b> are used to compute the tax-exempt average life for the remainder in Block <b>194</b>.</p>
    <p>Viewing the remainder as a taxable fixed-income security, the corresponding computations become much simpler. Input Data <b>200</b> receives the conventional Treasury yield curve, and Input Data <b>202</b> the corresponding (taxable) risk premium curve. Block <b>204</b> computes the taxable remainder yield rate, and Block <b>212</b> computes the taxable remainder purchase as the present value of the pretax remainder cash flows discounted at the yield rate computed in Block <b>204</b>. As in previous cases, Block <b>210</b> computes the average life, half life, and duration for the taxable remainder, and the average life is fed back to Block <b>204</b> to iterate the computation of the taxable remainder yield rate.</p>
    <p>Block <b>240</b> computes the sum of the estate for years and remainder prices. Block <b>242</b> computes a measure of profitability for the separation transaction by computing the difference between: (1) the sum of the estate for years price, the remainder price, the value of the unseparated portion of the partnership interests, and any underwriting fees received in connection with the overall transaction, and (2) the price of the tax-exempt fixed-income portfolio acquired by the partnership.</p>
    <p>An additional feature of component decomposition applied to tax-exempt fixed-income portfolios arises because of the zero-coupon nature of the remainder interest.</p>
    <p>During the estate for years term, the remainder is a zero-coupon security, and the return earned on the remainder is tax-deferred for a remainder investor; taxes are only due when the estate for years term has expired and the remainder investor begins to receive cash flows, or when the remainder is sold. Consequently, a tax-effective strategy for a philanthropic remainder purchaser would be the following: hold the remainder during the estate for years term while it earns tax-deferred returns, then make a charitable donation of the remainder when the estate for years term expires and take a charitable deduction enhanced by the increase in the remainder value. In addition, the remainder purchaser receives the satisfaction of seeing a favorite charitable foundation or institution receive a substantial fixed-income security as a gift.</p>
    <p>Logic Means <b>30</b> computes values to describe and measure the value generated by a remainder purchaser through a remainder donation. The key value needed by the remainder purchaser is the projected value of the remainder at the time of the donation. This value is a fixed-income present value computation analogous to the other present value computations made by Logic Means <b>30</b> in this application.</p>
    <p>Input Data <b>220</b> receives the projected date of a remainder donation. Frequently, though not necessarily, the projected donation date will be near the expiration of the estate for years term.</p>
    <p>Input Data <b>215</b> receives the AAA g. o. curve projected for the date of the donation, and Input Data <b>216</b> receives the corresponding risk premium curve projected for that date. Block <b>218</b> selects the appropriate AAA base rate and risk premium based on the average life of the remainder at the projected time of the remainder donation, and sums these two rates to obtain the projected discount rate needed to compute the projected present value of the remainder at the time it is donated.</p>
    <p>Block <b>224</b> computes the projected value of the remainder at the projected donation date; using this value, Block <b>222</b> computes the average life, half life, and duration for the remainder at the projected donation date. Using the remainder purchase price computed earlier, Block <b>230</b> computes the projected growth rate in the remainder value between the remainder purchase date and the remainder donation date.</p>
    <p>Using a projected donor tax rate schedule received by Input Data <b>228</b>, Block <b>228</b> computes the projected value of the donor tax saving generated for the remainder investor by the remainder donation.</p>
    <p>Block <b>232</b> computes the rate of return for the remainder purchaser from an investment equal in value to the remainder purchase price on the component separation date that generates a return equal in value to the projected value of the donor tax saving at the remainder donation date.</p>
    <p>Finally, under the additional assumption that the tax-exempt portfolio held by the partnership is a financial obligation of the intended recipient of the remainder donation, Block <b>234</b> subtracts the remainder cash flows after the projected donation date from the tax-exempt portfolio cash flows and recomputes the cost of debt capital on the tax-exempt portfolio based on the remaining cash flows and the initial value of the tax-exempt portfolio. This is an additional piece of financial information to aid the remainder purchaser in gauging the effectiveness of a prospective remainder donation under the assumption that the intended donation recipient is the original issuer of the tax-exempt portfolio; in this case, Block <b>234</b> measures the reduction in the cost of capital for the fixed-income debt obligations in the partnership portfolio due to the cancellation of the portion of the debt represented by the remainder component.</p>
    <heading>E. Interrelated Computer Systems</heading> <p>That aspect of the invention illustrated with respect to FIG. 2, etc., can function in cooperation with other computer systems respectively in different institutions involved in the decomposition. One or both component buyers preferably employ a digital electrical Computer System <b>243</b>, comprised of a processor in a computer, input means, output means, and logic means, such as preferably a computer program. Computer System <b>243</b> in FIG. 6 is programmed to receive and store cash flow and tax deduction schedules provided to the component buyer, or at least some of the Output <b>24</b> of System <b>2</b>. This data can be communicated electronically or by manually entering the data from hard copy produced by System <b>2</b> into Computer System <b>243</b> by a keyboard. The Computer System <b>243</b> is programmed to: (1) compute and/or recompute taxes, (2) complete and/or generate required annual and/or interim tax filing schedules, and/or (3) generate investment portfolio and income accounting reports required by regulatory agencies on a periodic basis from regulated institutional investors. This can include generation of an accounting income and valuation schedule to value an equity interest in a component and income therefrom for accounting purposes between the purchase date of the equity interest and the end of the estate for years term or beyond, based on generally accepted accounting principles, and can include insertion of the income and valuation schedule or portions thereof in investment portfolio and income accounting reporting and documentation. Parameters for this programming are straightforward: the tax code and accounting standards of the regulator(s).</p>
    <p>More particularly, this can be characterized as providing a second digital electrical computer controlled by a processor, the processor being controlled by logic means for receiving and storing in memory accessible by the computer electrical signals representing cash flow and tax deduction schedules provided to a component buyer. The logic means is also for manipulating the electrical signals representing cash flow and tax deduction schedules to produce altered electrical signals corresponding to at least one of the group consisting of (1) computing the tax, (2) generating a tax filing schedule, and (3) generating documentation at an output means electrically connected to said second computer.</p>
    <p>Computer System <b>244</b> has hardware and logic means analogous to Computer System <b>243</b>, except that the computer system is programmed particularly to examine a different tax and/or investment scenario than that used in the decomposition conducted in accordance with System <b>2</b> for at least one of the components, e.g., a tax scenario under a different interpretation of the tax code or a change in the tax code. Computer System <b>244</b> is programmed to generate a tax schedule from input data representing: (1) a breakdown of the cash payment schedule into schedules of interest/income payments and return of principal payments, (2) the security purchase price, and—in the case of estate for years securities—(3) the estate for years term. This input data includes at least some of the output <b>24</b>. The Computer System <b>244</b> in FIG. 6 can also be programmed to format the schedule of tax deductions for transmittal to other computer systems, and to store and transmit this schedule in exactly the same way that System <b>2</b> does.</p>
    <p>Computer System <b>244</b> thus can be programmed to compute: (1) independent verification of the tax deduction schedules furnished to purchasers by sellers, and/or (2) a sensitivity analysis of the effect of future modifications in the tax code on the tax deduction schedule generated by the security and/or the effect of these modifications on the present value of the aftertax cash flows.</p>
    <p>More particularly, the Computer System <b>244</b> can be characterized as providing a second digital electrical computer controlled by third logic means controlling a second processor in manipulating other digital electrical signals representing next input data to the second computer, the next input data characterizing at least one of the at least two components decomposed from the property, the manipulating by the second processor including transforming the other digital electrical signals into other modified digital electrical signals representing a respective value for the at least one of the two components, the respective value being computed to reflect taxation for the components under a second tax and/or investment scenario. Additionally involved is providing second input means electrically connected to the second computer converting the next input data into the other digital electrical signals, and communicating the corresponding other digital electrical signals to the second computer; and providing second output means electrically connected to the second computer for receiving the other modified digital electrical signals from the second computer, and converting the other modified digital electrical signals representing the respective value into a printed document.</p>
    <p>Computer System <b>244</b> usually computes output values, for example, component prices and expected returns for a specific set of input parameter values at the time property decomposition into components occurs. Computer System <b>244</b> can also be programmed to perform risk analysis for the output parameters, e.g., by Monte Carlo analysis, for example, for the expected remainder annual return.</p>
    <p>More particularly, an example of a risk analysis input (e.g., in the case of expected remainder annual return) is a probability distribution for the expected property value at a future time (e.g., at the end of the estate for years term) and a set of values for the other input parameters for the embodiment. Computer System <b>244</b> can be programmed to generate random samples from the probability distribution for expected future property value, and each random sample for the expected future property value can be combined with the fixed values for the other input parameters and processed to generate a set of output values, including a value for expected annual remainder return. By generating repeated random samples of the multiple future property value (e.g., normally at least one thousand, and usually at least ten thousand), Computer System <b>244</b> generates a probability distribution for the expected annual remainder return and can compute investment risk parameters for the expected annual remainder return from the distribution, for example, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.</p>
    <p>In cases involving further decomposition of the remainder component into a preferred interest and a residual interest, Computer System <b>244</b> also generates a probability distribution for the expected annual residual return and can compute investment risk parameters for the expected annual residual return from the distribution, for example, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.</p>
    <p>For the case of support for a decision about a commitment to component decomposition significantly in advance of the expected date for the component decomposition or in advance of the expected date for at least one component purchase, Computer System <b>144</b> can compute the probability that the decomposition of property into components and the at least one component purchase will become uneconomical due to changes in the values of input parameters between the date of the analysis and the expected date of component separation.</p>
    <p>More particularly, in this case, an example of an additional input for a Computer System <b>244</b> risk analysis is a probability distribution for at least one input parameter, for example, a multivariate probability distribution for the following group of input parameters: the yield curve, the risk premium curve for the estate for years component, the risk premium curve for the preferred interest (in cases wherein there is or will be a preferred interest), and the future property value that will be expected at the time of component decomposition. An example of an additional input value for Computer System <b>244</b> in this case is at least one of the following: a value for the minimum required annual return for remainder interest investor(s), a value for the minimum required annual return for residual interest investor(s), and a value for the minimum required annual return for estate for years interest investor(s). Computer System <b>244</b> generates a multivariate distribution for the output parameters, from which it can compute a risk analysis of the financial success or failure of the transaction. For example, Computer System can compute at least one of the values for the following risk parameters: the probability that the sum of the estate for years purchase price and the remainder interest purchase price will not be sufficient to cover the sale price of the property together with associated expenses such as real estate brokerage commissions and the cost of component decomposition, the expected magnitude of the deficit, the expected magnitude of the deficit given that a deficit does occur, and the below-target semivariance of the deficit.</p>
    <p>Computer System <b>246</b> is again structurally analogous to that of Computer System <b>243</b>, with the digital electrical computer being controlled in its signal processing by a processor, etc. However, Computer System <b>246</b> can be used by an insurance company, for example, in computing premiums for writing insurance against the savings that accrue to the component purchaser from tax deductions generated by the component. Computing insurance premiums for a given event is a well explored discipline, though in the present case, it would reflect sensitivity analyses of the effect of tax code modifications too. Thus, the invention discussed with respect to FIG. 2 can be employed in combination with software for determining insurance premiums. Because tax deductions are default free, there is no credit risk associated with these deductions that might be reduced by insurance. However, insurance can be written against legislative risk that results from potential (future) changes in the tax law, such as: (1) changes in tax brackets and rates that inversely affect the value of tax deductions generated by the security, and (2) modifications of tax code regulations regarding availability and/or scheduling of tax deductions.</p>
    <p>More particularly, Computer System <b>246</b> can be characterized as providing a second digital electrical computer controlled by third logic means controlling a second processor in manipulating other digital electrical signals representing next input data to the second computer, the next input data characterizing at least one of the two components decomposed from the property, the manipulating by the second processor including transforming the other digital electrical signals into other modified digital electrical signals representing a respective value under a second tax scenario for the at least one of the two components, the manipulating by the second processor also including transforming the other digital electrical signals into still other modified digital electrical signals representing an insurance premium for insurance against the second tax scenario. Additionally involved is providing second input means electrically connected to the second computer converting the next input data into the other digital electrical signals, and communicating the corresponding other digital electrical signals to the second computer; and providing second output means electrically connected to the second computer for receiving the still other modified digital electrical signals from the second computer, and converting the still other modified digital electrical signals representing the insurance premium into a printed document.</p>
    <p>Computer System <b>246</b> can also be used by an insurance company in computing premiums for writing insurance against an economic risk in a component. For the case of an estate for years component, this can include insurance to protect the estate for years holder against any property-related risk that might otherwise be assumed by purchase of the estate for years component in cases wherein the existing leases are not bondable net. Insurance for the estate for years component can also include credit enhancement insurance to raise the credit rating of the estate for years component to investment grade in cases wherein one or more existing lessees for the property have below-investment-grade credit ratings. For the case of a remainder component, this can include residual value insurance, which sets a minimum target valuation for the property and insures the remainder interest holder against the risk that the property value will be below the target valuation when the remainder interest matures into ownership of the property.</p>
    <p>In the case of residual value insurance for remainders, such policies have been discussed in recent years for conventional real estate ownership. However, in this case they suffer from the defect that the insurer has a subordinate claim on the real estate to any mortgage lender. Thus the insurer can suffer huge losses if tenants default and the mortgage lender forecloses because of temporary cash flow deficiencies, events which have nothing to do with the underlying economics of the real estate. By contrast, residual value insurance on the remainder provides the insurer with an unsubordinated claim on the real estate. This is the rationale for the innovation of residual value insurance for remainders.</p>
    <p>Computer System <b>248</b> in FIG. 6 is again structurally analogous to that of Computer System <b>244</b>, except it is programmed, to: (1) receive market-based interest rate inputs, (2) compute the current market-based yield/discount rate for the component, (3) determine the current market/based price of the component by computing the sum of the present values of expected aftertax future cash flows and future purchaser tax savings from tax deductions generated by the component.</p>
    <p>Computer System <b>248</b> is adapted to provide analytic support for purchasers who might need to sell or resell the component security at some time prior to the maturity date of the security. Thus, making use of logic such as that in FIG. 2, Computer System <b>248</b> is programmed to price the security for resale and to compute the schedule of tax deductions generated by the security for the subsequent owner if a resale effort is successful.</p>
    <p>More particularly, Computer System <b>248</b> can be characterized as providing a second digital electrical computer controlled by third logic means controlling a second processor in manipulating other digital electrical signals representing next input data to the second computer, the next input data characterizing at least one of the two components decomposed from the property, the manipulating by the second processor including transforming the other digital electrical signals into other modified digital electrical signals representing a respective value under a tax scenario for the at least one of the two components, the manipulating by the second processor also including computing current market-based yield/discount rate for the at least one component, and determining a market/based price of the at least one component by computing a sum of present values of expected aftertax future cash flows and future purchaser tax savings from tax deductions generated by the at least one component. Additionally involved is providing second input means electrically connected to the second computer converting the next input data into the other digital electrical signals, and communicating the corresponding other digital electrical signals to the second computer; and providing second output means electrically connected to the second computer for receiving the other modified digital electrical signals from the second computer, and converting the other modified digital electrical signals into an illustration of data corresponding to the other modified electrical signals.</p>
    <p>As with any of the above-referenced computer systems and methods for making or using them, the invention extends to any kind of property, including a portfolio of at least one tax-exempt fixed income security. Further, the tax may be computed in different ways, including with an accelerated deduction for at least one of the components, as well as taxation under different interpretations of the existing tax code, or under a changed tax code altogether, without at all departing from the spirit of the invention of the computer system and methods related to electrical signal processing.</p>
    <heading>VI.

    <heading>SPECIMEN 3</heading> <heading>SUMMARY OF TERMS</heading> <heading>THE ESTATE FOR YEARS COMPONENT SECURITY</heading> <heading>For Real Estate to Be Occupied by</heading> <heading>Anonymous Mortgage Company at Typical Industrial Park</heading> <heading>Anytown, Ill.</heading> <p>DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY:</p>
    <p>The security, henceforth known as the “Security,” is the sole beneficial interest in a grantor trust that will be established to hold the deed to an estate for years in the land and improvements described in Exhibit A, henceforth known as the “Premises.” The estate for years will be created as part of a transaction in which fee simple ownership of the Premises will change hands, the estate for years to be acquired by the trust and the remainder interest to be acquired by a legally separate entity.</p>
    <p>The Premises have been fully (100%) pre-leased on a triple-net basis to a single tenant for an initial term of approximately ten years. The lease is uncancellable during the initial term except as described below. The Security entitles the holder to receive Base Rent from the lease on the Premises during the initial lease term, and to re-lease the Premises subject to specified restrictions in the event of premature lease cancellation.</p>
    <p>The Security has similar investment characteristics to an asset-backed bond: a debt-like obligation with the right to legal recourse to compel Tenant performance absent Tenant bankruptcy; and in Tenant bankruptcy, a senior claim to repossess the asset (term occupancy of the Premises) that secures the debt-like obligation if the Tenant repudiates the obligation. The general rental agreement formalizes financial restrictions, offering sufficient security for classification of the Security as a fixed-income investment for regulatory purposes.</p>
    <p>DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY TERM:</p>
    <p>Expiration of the estate for years term will coincide with expiration of the initial lease term. The period from acquisition of the estate for years by the grantor trust to expiration of the initial lease term will henceforth be known as the “Term.”</p>
    <p>Covenants in the estate for years deed and the remainder interest deed will provide for claims of the estate for years beneficiary incurred during the Term to survive the Term expiration. The grantor trust indenture will provide for continuation of the trust until all such claims are resolved.</p>
    <p>DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY LEASE:</p>
    <p>The Tenant is Anonymous Mortgage Company, a wholly-owned affiliate of Anonymous Conglomerate Corporation. The lease is tentatively scheduled to begin on Oct. 15, 1992, and will expire on the last day of the calendar month that contains the tenth anniversary of the Commencement Eve Date, where the Commencement Eve Date is the day immediately prior to the commencement of the lease term.</p>
    <p>DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY CASH FLOWS:</p>
    <p>Security cash flows consist of Base Rent from the Anonymous Mortgage lease. Annual Base Rent is determined by multiplying the annual base rent per square foot by the building net square footage. Initial annual Base Rent per square foot is $11.00. The preliminary estimate of net square footage is 100,000 feet, implying an estimated initial Annual Base rent of $1,100,000.</p>
    <p>The building net square footage, and hence the initial net rent, will be finalized for the Term as described in Lease Section 3.02 within ten days of the Lease Commencement date.</p>
    <p>Annual Base Rent per square foot in subsequent lease years is determined by increasing the base rent per square foot in the preceding year by three percent (3%) and rounding the resulting value off to the nearest cent ($0.01).</p>
    <p>Base Rent is due in equal monthly installments at the beginning of each month.</p>
    <p>Prepayment:</p>
    <p>Security cash flows cannot be reduced by prepayment.</p>
    <p>Tax Shields:</p>
    <p>From a legal perspective the Security is an income-producing asset, so tax treatment of Security cash flows differs from tax treatment of cash flows generated by debt securities.</p>
    <p>Tax deductions generated by the Security arise from amortization of a wasting asset purchase price rather than from the separation of cash flows into taxable and tax-exempt (i.e. interest and principal) components. Since Security deductions are generated by asset characteristics rather than by cash flow receipts, Security tax deductions are independent of cash flows. Consequently, whereas the credit risk of Security cash flows is determined by the credit risk of Anonymous Mortgage, Security tax deductions are default free.</p>
    <p>The Security holder is entitled to an annual amortization deduction on the estate for years. The annual deduction is computed by multiplying the Security tax basis by the following ratio: the number of days during the tax year that the grantor trust held the estate for years divided by the number of days remaining in the estate for years on the first day of the tax year that the grantor trust held title.</p>
    <p>Amortization deductions are classified for tax reporting purposes as passive deductions, and are subject to the restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code on the use of such deductions to offset taxes on income. These restrictions vary with the tax status and classification of the beneficiary.</p>
    <p>DEFINITION OF DEFAULT:</p>
    <p>Any of the following events constitutes a default under the Security lease: failure by Tenant to pay monthly Rent when due, together with failure to pay within ten (10) days after Landlord serves Tenant with written notice of past due Rent; failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other provision of the lease, provided that such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice of such failure or, if the failure cannot be corrected within the ten (10) day period, provided that Tenant does not commence to correct the failure within the ten (10) day period and thereafter pursue the correction through to completion within a reasonable time, and in any case prior to such time as failure to complete the correction could result in violation of any law, rule, or ordinance; failure by Tenant to pay monthly Rent on time more than three (3) times during any twelve (12) month period, or failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other provision of the lease more than three (3) times during any twelve (12) month period; performance by Tenant of any act that results in the creation of a lien upon the Premises and fails to discharge the lien or post bond for the lien with Landlord as required by Lease Article XX; any attempt by Tenant to make an unpermitted assignment or sublease; failure by Tenant to maintain in force all insurance policies required by the lease, and such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice of such failure; the filing of a petition against Tenant or any guarantor of the lease under any section of the Bankruptcy Code (and in the case of an involuntary proceeding, the filing is not permanently discharged or vacated within sixty (60) days); if Tenant or any guarantor of the lease becomes insolvent or makes a transfer in fraud of creditors or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; a court-authorized appointment of a receiver, custodian, or trustee for substantially all Tenant assets or all assets of or any guarantor of the lease is made and not subsequently vacated within sixty (60) days of the initial appointment date; the cumulative transfer of more than 50% interest in Anonymous Mortgage that results in Anonymous retaining less than a 50% interest Anonymous Mortgage.</p>
    <p>DEFAULT RECOURSE:</p>
    <p>Security Lease Provisions:</p>
    <p>In event of default, Landlord has the right to enter and take possession of the Premises and if Landlord elects, at Tenant's expense release the Premises and/or repair any damage for which Tenant is responsible. In the event that Landlord relets the Premises: Tenant is liable for all costs associated with the default and with recovery of the Premises; all accumulated Rent up to the time the Anonymous Mortgage lease is terminated; costs associated with preparing the Premises for new tenants; and any deficiency between the present value of rent payable by new tenants over the remaining Term and the present value of Anonymous Mortgage rent contracted in the current lease. The deficiency between the present value of total rent payable by the new tenant(s) and contracted total rent in the Anonymous Mortgage lease can be calculated either: before the new lease(s) are signed, on the basis of expected market rent; after the new lease(s) are signed, on the basis of actual rent specified in the new lease(s).</p>
    <p>Letter of Credit:</p>
    <p>For the duration of the lease Anonymous or a successor Anonymous-affiliated parent of Anonymous Mortgage agrees to provide a one-time two million dollar ($2,000,000) irrevocable letter of credit within two (2) business days of receipt of written notification from Landlord of any one of the following events: Tenant default under the lease that remains uncured for twenty (20) days after written notification to Anonymous Real Estate and which, in the case of nonmonetary default, Tenant has not commenced or has not diligently pursued to cure; a decline in Tenant net worth, as calculated annually, of either more than five percent (5%) of total Tenant assets or below twenty-five million dollars, which continues without correction for ten (10) business days after the determination of the decline. The letter of credit must be issued by a nationally recognized institution with sufficient funds available to fund such a credit instrument at the time of issuance.</p>
    <p>In the event that Anonymous Real Estate or its successor Anonymous-affiliated parent fails to provide the agreed-upon letter of credit as required, Anonymous agrees to provide the letter of credit within ten (10) business days of written notification from Landlord of nonperformance of the first-specified provider.</p>
    <p>In event of Tenant default(s), Landlord can draw cumulatively against the credit line provided by the letter up to the lesser of the default amount and the remaining balance of the credit line. If Tenant default results in lease termination, the entire remaining balance on the letter of credit will be available immediately to the Landlord.</p>
    <p>In event of a Tenant default resulting in lease termination prior to the end of the Term, then effective as of the termination date, the amount deemed due and owing to Landlord pursuant to the Letter of Credit agreement shall be the amount due and owing to Landlord pursuant to the lease remedies provisions.</p>
    <p>In event that the scheduled letter of credit expiration date is earlier than the end of the Term, Landlord is entitled to draw upon the full outstanding balance of the credit line unless the letter is renewed at least thirty (30) days prior to scheduled expiration for an amount equal to the remaining outstanding balance.</p>
    <p>INTERRUPTION OF CASH FLOWS:</p>
    <p>Condemnation:</p>
    <p>If the entire Premises is acquired or condemned by eminent domain, the lease terminates as of the date the condemning authority takes possession, and total Rent due is adjusted to that date.</p>
    <p>If partial condemnation results in the loss by Landlord of at least five percent (5%) of the Building or ten percent (10%) of parking for the Building, then Tenant may elect to terminate the lease within thirty (30) days of final determination of the extent of the loss, termination to occur as of the date the condemning authority takes possession, and total Rent due is adjusted to that date.</p>
    <p>If Tenant has the option to terminate the lease but fails to exercise the option, then Landlord shall promptly restore the remaining Premises to a condition comparable to its condition immediately prior to condemnation and the lease shall continue as prior to the condemnation, except that after the effective date of condemnation the Rent shall be reduced as reasonably determined by Landlord if such reduction is reasonably warranted. Tenant waives any right or claim to any part of a compensatory award from the condemning authority to Landlord, and waives any claim against Landlord due to the condemnation.</p>
    <p>In any action of eminent domain involving the Premises, the grantor trust and the remainder interest holder make separate compensation claims against the condemning authority. The estate for years deed and the remainder interest deed will disallow condemnation claims of the deed holders against each other.</p>
    <p>Damage and Destruction:</p>
    <p>The Security holder shall carry rent business interruption insurance applicable to the Premises sufficient to cover Base Rent payments plus all related taxes and operating expenses for a period of 300 days. The cost of business interruption insurance will be reimbursed by the Tenant, including all related appraisal and consulting fees.</p>
    <p>If the Building or any portion thereof is damaged or destroyed to such an extent that it cannot be repaired within two hundred seventy days of the event, then the Tenant has the right to terminate the lease by giving the Landlord written notice within the later of (i) thirty (30) days after the event or (ii) five (5) business days after determination that the damage or destruction cannot be repaired within 270 days. The Landlord would continue to receive Base Rent for the period covered by business interruption insurance, and would have the right to relet the Premises after restoration for the remainder of the Term.</p>
    <p>In event of destruction or damage to the Building which does not result in lease termination but which renders the Building wholly or partially untenantable, Base Rent shall be abated in proportion to the area so rendered until restoration is completed. However, the Landlord would continue to receive the abated portion of Base Rent plus operating expenses while restoration is under way due to business interruption insurance, unless restoration took longer than 300 days.</p>
    <p>If the Building or any portion thereof is destroyed by fire or other cause during the last two (2) years of the lease term, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate the lease by giving written notice to the Landlord within sixty (60) days of the destruction. In this case, the Landlord would continue to receive Base Rent plus taxes and operating expenses from business interruption insurance for 300 days.</p>
    <p>PRESERVATION OF ASSET THAT SECURES CASH FLOWS:</p>
    <p>Grantor Trust:</p>
    <p>The grantor trust indenture will charge the trustee with preventing the Security holder from imposing any lien whatsoever on the Premises, with removing any liens imposed by other entities that the Security holder does not promptly seek to remove by all legal means available, and otherwise with passing tenant rent through to the Security holder. Otherwise, ultimate responsibility for Landlord decisions concerning property management, maintenance, insurance and taxes will remain with the Security holder during the Term, although under the Anonymous Mortgage lease the Tenant will assume full responsibility for performance in these areas as prescribed in the lease, together with responsibility for direct payment of all costs associated with performance. The trust indenture assigns the Security holder the general responsibilities accorded financial fiduciaries, reserving other specified services to the trustee as appropriate.</p>
    <p>During the final Term year, the Security holder and Anonymous Mortgage are responsible only for management and maintenance costs incurred prior to Term expiration, and only for a pro rata share of tax and insurance expenses based on the ratio of the number of days during the year that fall within the estate for years to the total number of days in the year.</p>
    <p>Management and Maintenance:</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage assumes full and sole responsibility for the condition, operation, repair, replacement, management and maintenance of the Premises and all improvements thereon. At its own expense, Anonymous Mortgage Company will keep the Premises both clean and in good order and operating condition, and make all necessary repairs (both structural and nonstructural, interior and exterior, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen, of every nature, kind and description, including parking areas, driveways, sidewalks, landscaping and roadways).</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage will maintain, at its own expense, service contracts satisfactory to the Landlord for the following: (i) maintenance for HVAC systems, roof, elevators, landscaping and irrigation, and the parking lot; (ii) fire alarm service; (iii) janitorial service; (iv) security service; (v) snow removal; (vi) exterior window cleaning at least four (4) times per calendar year.</p>
    <p>If, after expiration of the sixth (6th) year of the lease term, any capital repairs are required, and such repairs are not required due to (i) the failure of the tenant to perform routine maintenance required by the lease, (ii) tenant negligence, (iii) unusual or excessive tenant use of any system or portion of the Premises, or (iv) any tenant act which voids a warranty that otherwise would reimburse repair costs, then tenant is only required to pay a fraction of the repair cost based on the ratio of the remaining lease term (including exercised options for extension) to the remaining useful life of the item repaired.</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage will not make any alterations to the Premises without first obtaining written Landlord consent, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Landlord may refuse permission for any alterations that are likely to weaken the structure of the Building, which are likely to damage or disrupt the HVAC systems or other major Building systems, or which are visible from the exterior of the Building. All alterations shall be made at Tenant's sole expense, either by Tenants contractors approved in advance by Landlord or, at Tenant's option, by Landlord on terms reasonable to Tenant, including a fifteen percent (15%) supervisory fee in addition to the net cost of the materials and labor.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the above, Anonymous Mortgage will pay, in addition to Base Rent, a management fee of one and eight tenths percent (1.8%) of the Base rent for administering the lease and as reimbursement of Landlord expenses for the costs of semiannual maintenance review and other management overhead.</p>
    <p>Taxes:</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for direct payment of all real and personal property-related taxes (except income taxes) as specified in Lease Section 5.01. Tenant will provide Landlord with evidence in the form of official receipts or other acceptable proof that complete payment has been made within thirty (30) days of each assessment due date.</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage has the right at its sole expense to contest the validity or amount of any tax, but will first pay the tax under protest.</p>
    <p>For taxes and assessments related to the calendar year during which the Term expires, the Security holder is responsible for a pro rata share of taxes and assessments based on the ratio of the number of days during the year that fall within the Term to the total number of days in the year, and the remainder interest holder is responsible for the remaining portion of taxes and assessments. If the lease has not been extended, Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for the portion of taxes attributable to the Security. If the lease has been extended, Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for all property taxes incurred during the calendar year.</p>
    <p>Insurance and Indemnification:</p>
    <p>Tenant shall obtain and maintain various insurance policies related to the Premises and activities therein. All expenses in connection with Tenant policies shall be the sole responsibility of the Tenant.</p>
    <p>Tenant policies shall include the following: All Risk insurance sufficient to cover the replacement cost of Tenant personal property, Building improvements and alterations; business interruption insurance; comprehensive general public liability insurance with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence; automobile liability insurance of at least $300,000; Worker's Compensation and Employer's Liability insurance; Tenants All Risk Legal Liability insurance for the replacement cost of the Premises.</p>
    <p>Except for events due to Landlord negligence or willful misconduct, Tenant waives all claims against Landlord and agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless for damage to any property, or injury to or death of any person, on or about the Premises. This includes injury or damage to persons or property resulting from fire, explosion, falling plaster, steam, gas, electricity, water, rain, flood, snow, dampness, or leaks from pipes, appliances, plumbing works, roof, floor or ceiling subsurfaces or from the street.</p>
    <p>Utilities:</p>
    <p>During the Term, Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for all deposits and fees in connection with obtaining and maintaining necessary utility services for the Premises, including but not limited to the following: water, sewage, heat, gas, light, garbage, electricity, telephone, steam and power.</p>
    <p>Tenant-Incurred Liens:</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage warrants to keep the Premises free from any liens arising from any work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by or on behalf of Anonymous Mortgage. If any such lien is attached and not promptly discharged as prescribed in Lease Section 10.01, Landlord has the right to pay the full amount of the lien without inquiry into its validity, and to bill Tenant as Additional Rent for all expenses connected with the lien removal, including interest and attorneys' fees.</p>
    <p>Hazardous Materials and Indemnification:</p>
    <p>Tenant is restricted to use of the Premises for executive, sales and administrative purposes. For the restrictions on use and/or handling of hazardous and toxic material, see Lease Article XXV.</p>
    <p>Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord, its beneficiaries, any managing agents and leasing agents of the Premises, and their respective agents, partners, officers, directors and employees harmless from all damages, costs, losses, expenses (including, but not limited to, actual attorney's fees and engineering fees) arising from or attributable to any breach by Tenant or any of its warranties, representations or covenants in Lease Article XXV. Tenant's obligations hereunder shall survive termination of this lease.</p>
    <p>Remainder Interest Liens:</p>
    <p>During the Term the remainder interest will be held in a grantor trust. Among the primary responsibilities of the remainder interest trustee will be to prevent any liens whatsoever from being attached to the remainder interest fee.</p>
    <p>TENANT FINANCIAL REPORTS:</p>
    <p>During each year of the Term, on no later than March 1, Anonymous Mortgage shall provide Landlord with a net worth report as of December 31 of the prior calendar year and the preceding year. The report shall be certified by a nationally recognized accounting firm.</p>
    <p>At any time during the Term, up to once per fiscal year, Tenant will, upon ten days prior notice from Trustee A, provide the Trustee with a current financial statement and financial statements for the two (2) preceding fiscal years. The statements will be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.</p>
    <heading>SPECIMEN 4</heading> <heading>SUMMARY OF TERMS</heading> <heading>THE REMAINDER EQUITY COMPONENT SECURITY</heading> <heading>For Real Estate to Be Occupied by</heading> <heading>Anonymous Mortgage Company at Typical Industrial Park</heading> <heading>Anytown, Ill.</heading> <p>DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY:</p>
    <p>The security, henceforth known as the “Security,” is the sole beneficial interest in a land or grantor trust, as will be determined, that will be established to hold the deed to the remainder interest in the land and improvements described in Exhibit A, henceforth known as the “Premises.” The remainder interest will be created as part of a transaction in which fee simple ownership of the Premises changes hands and is separated into an estate for years and a remainder interest. The remainder interest will be acquired by the Trust and the estate for years will be acquired by a legally separate trust. The trust indenture will assign the Security holder the general responsibilities accorded financial fiduciaries, reserving other specified services to the trustee as appropriate.</p>
    <p>The holder of the estate for years will have the right to all rent paid by tenants for occupancy of the Premises during the estate for years term. Covenants in the estate for years deed and the remainder interest deed will provide for claims by the estate for years holder against tenants incurred during the estate for years term to survive expiration of the estate for years term. All other rights of property ownership after expiration of the estate for years term belong to the Security holder.</p>
    <p>The Security has similar investment characteristics to a zero-coupon bond: a remainder interest with a specified term and a balloon payment at maturity, and no cash flows prior to maturity. Unlike a zero-coupon bond, the balloon payment at maturity consists of the fee simple interest in real property rather than a nominal cash payment.</p>
    <p>DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY:</p>
    <p>The Premises are located in the Typical Industrial Park, a 400 acre master-planned business park under development in Anytown, Illinois. The park is zoned for office and light industrial facilities.</p>
    <p>The Building is a two-story, 100,000 square foot build-to-suit office building configured for multitenant occupancy but fully (100%) pre-leased on a triple-net basis to Anonymous Mortgage Company, a wholly-owned affiliate of Anonymous Conglomerate Corporation, for initial term of approximately ten years with options for renewal.</p>
    <p>DESCRIPTION OF LEASE TERM:</p>
    <p>The Anonymous Mortgage lease is tentatively scheduled to begin on Oct. 15, 1992, and will expire on the last day of the calendar month that contains the tenth anniversary of the Commencement Eve Date, where the Commencement Eve Date is the day immediately prior to the commencement of the lease term. The lease is not cancelable during the initial term except as described below.</p>
    <p>The period from acquisition of the remainder interest by the grantor trust to expiration of the initial lease term will henceforth be known as the “Term.”</p>
    <p>Automatic Lease Extension:</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage Company and the developer have entered into an option agreement (Phase II) under which, at the option of Anonymous Mortgage, a second office building may be constructed and leased on a build-to-suit basis to Anonymous Mortgage on property adjacent to the Premises. In the event the option is exercised, the initial lease term will automatically be extended to cause the expiration of the initial lease term to coincide with the expiration of the 10-year Phase II lease. However, in the event of an extension of the initial lease term, the expiration of the Term of the Security will remain unchanged. The Phase II option to extend the initial lease term expires on Jun. 1, 1993.</p>
    <p>Renewal Options:</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage shall have options to extend the lease term for two (2) consecutive five (5) year periods, on the same terms, conditions and provisions as contained in the lease agreement for the initial lease term. The first renewal period shall commence on the day after the expiration date for the initial lease term and shall expire on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the expiration date for the initial lease term. The second renewal period shall commence on the day after the expiration date for the first renewal period and shall expire on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the expiration date for the first renewal period.</p>
    <p>Exercise of each renewal option shall be exercised by written notice from Tenant to Landlord of Tenant's election to exercise said option. Written notice must be provided not later than twelve (12) months prior to expiration of the then current lease term.</p>
    <p>DESCRIPTION OF RENT:</p>
    <p>Total Rent consists of Base Rent from the Anonymous Mortgage lease, plus Additional Rent to cover property management, maintenance, taxes and insurance as described in subsequent sections. Annual Base Rent is determined by multiplying the annual base rent per square foot by the building net square footage. Initial Annual Base Rent per square foot is $11.00. The preliminary estimate of net square footage is 100,000 feet, implying an estimated initial Annual Base rent of $1,100,000.</p>
    <p>The building net square footage, and hence the initial net rent, will be finalized for the Term as described in Lease Section 3.02 within ten days of the Lease Commencement Date.</p>
    <p>Annual Base Rent per square foot in subsequent years of the initial lease term (including the Phase II extension option) is determined by increasing the base rent per square foot in the preceding year by three percent (3%) and rounding the resulting value off to the nearest cent ($0.01).</p>
    <p>During the first year of the first renewal option period, Annual Base Rent shall be the greater of (i) initial Annual Base Rent on the Lease Commencement Date, increased by three percent (3%) per year compounded annually through the first day of the renewal period, and (ii) ninety-five percent (95%) of the fair market rental rate as defined in Lease Section 26.04(a).</p>
    <p>In each successive year of the renewal option period, Annual Base Rent shall increase by an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the Annual Base Rent for the preceding year.</p>
    <p>During the first year of the second renewal option period, Annual Base Rent shall be the greater of (i) initial Annual Base Rent on the Lease Commencement Date, increased by three percent (3%) per year compounded annually through the first day of the renewal period, and (ii) the fair market rental rate as defined in Lease Section 26.04(a). In each successive year of the renewal option period, Annual Base Rent shall increase by an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the Annual Base Rent for the preceding year.</p>
    <p>Base Rent is due in equal monthly installments at the beginning of each month. Additional Rent is paid directly or as described under “Preservation of Property” and “Damage and Destruction.”</p>
    <p>PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY:</p>
    <p>Estate for Years Trust:</p>
    <p>The trust indenture for the estate for years will forbid the trustee from imposing any lien whatsoever on the Premises and will charge the trustee with removing any liens imposed by other entities that the trust beneficiary does not promptly seek to remove by all legal means available. Otherwise, ultimate responsibility and discretion regarding Landlord decisions concerning property management, maintenance, insurance is and taxes will remain with the estate for years trust during the Term, although under the Anonymous Mortgage lease the Tenant will assume full responsibility for performance in these areas as prescribed in the lease, together with responsibility for direct payment of all costs associated with performance. The trust indenture assigns the estate for years beneficiary the general responsibilities accorded financial fiduciaries, reserving other specified services to the estate for years trustee as appropriate.</p>
    <p>During the final Term year, the estate for years trust is responsible only for management and maintenance costs incurred prior to Term expiration, and only for a pro rata share of tax and insurance expenses based on the ratio of the number of days during the year that fall within the estate for years to the total number of days in the year.</p>
    <p>Management and Maintenance:</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage assumes full and sole responsibility for the condition, operation, repair, replacement, management and maintenance of the Premises and all improvements thereon. At its own expense, Anonymous Mortgage Company will keep the Premises both clean and in good order and operating condition, and make all necessary repairs (both structural and nonstructural, interior and exterior, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen, of every nature, kind and description, including parking areas, driveways, sidewalks, landscaping and roadways).</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage will maintain, at its own expense, service contracts satisfactory to the Landlord for the following: (i) maintenance for HVAC systems, roof, elevators, landscaping and irrigation, and the parking lot; (ii) fire alarm service; (iii) janitorial service; (iv) security service; (v) snow removal; (vi) exterior window cleaning at least four (4) times per calendar year.</p>
    <p>If, after expiration of the sixth (6th) year of the lease term, any capital repairs are required, and such repairs are not required due to (i) the failure of the tenant to perform routine maintenance required by the lease, (ii) tenant negligence, (iii) unusual or excessive tenant use of any system or portion of the Premises, or (iv) any tenant act which voids a warranty that otherwise would reimburse repair costs, then tenant is only required to pay a fraction of the repair cost based on the ratio of the remaining lease term (including exercised options for extension) to the remaining useful life of the item repaired.</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage will not make any alterations to the Premises without first obtaining written Landlord consent, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Landlord may refuse permission for any alterations that are likely to weaken the structure of the Building, which are likely to damage or disrupt the HVAC systems or other major Building systems, or which are visible from the exterior of the Building. All alterations shall be made at Tenant's sole expense, either by Tenant's contractors approved in advance by Landlord or, at Tenant's option, by Landlord on terms reasonable to Tenant, including a fifteen percent (15%) supervisory fee in addition to the net cost of the materials and labor.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the above, Anonymous Mortgage will pay, in addition to Base Rent, a management fee of one and eight tenths percent (1.8%) of the Base rent for administering the lease and as reimbursement of Landlord expenses for the costs of semiannual maintenance review and other management overhead.</p>
    <p>Taxes:</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for direct payment of all real and personal property-related taxes (except income taxes) as specified in Lease Section 5.01. Tenant will provide Landlord with evidence in the form of official receipts or other acceptable proof that complete payment has been made within thirty (30) days of each assessment due date.</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage has the right at its sole expense to contest the validity or amount of any tax, but will first pay the tax under protest.</p>
    <p>For taxes and assessments related to the calendar year during which the Term expires, the estate for years trust is responsible for a pro rata share of taxes and assessments based on the ratio of the number of days during the year that fall within the Term to the total number of days in the year, and the Security holder is responsible for the remaining portion of taxes and assessments. If the lease has not been extended, Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for the portion of taxes attributable to the estate for years. If the lease has been extended, Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for all property taxes incurred during the calendar year.</p>
    <p>Insurance and Indemnification:</p>
    <p>Tenant shall obtain and maintain various insurance policies related to the Premises and activities therein. All expenses in connection with Tenant policies shall be the sole responsibility of the Tenant.</p>
    <p>Tenant policies shall include the following: All Risk insurance sufficient to cover the replacement cost of Tenant personal property, Building improvements and alterations; business interruption insurance; comprehensive general public liability insurance with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence; automobile liability insurance of at least $300,000; Worker's Compensation and Employer's Liability insurance; Tenant's All Risk Legal Liability insurance for the replacement cost of the Premises.</p>
    <p>Except for events due to Landlord negligence or willful misconduct, Tenant waives all claims against Landlord and agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless for damage to any property, or injury to or death of any person, on or about the Premises. This includes injury or damage to persons or property resulting from fire, explosion, falling plaster, steam, gas, electricity, water, rain, flood, snow, dampness, or leaks from pipes, appliances, plumbing works, roof, floor or ceiling subsurfaces or from the street.</p>
    <p>Utilities:</p>
    <p>During the Term, Anonymous Mortgage is responsible for all deposits and fees in connection with obtaining and maintaining necessary utility services for the Premises, including but not limited to the following: water, sewage, heat, gas, light, garbage, electricity, telephone, steam and power.</p>
    <p>Tenant-incurred Liens:</p>
    <p>Anonymous Mortgage warrants to keep the Premises free from any liens arising from any work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by or on behalf of Anonymous Mortgage. If any such lien is attached and not promptly discharged as prescribed in Lease Section 10.01, Landlord has the right to pay the full amount of the lien without inquiry into its validity, and to bill Tenant as Additional Rent for all expenses connected with the lien removal, including interest and attorneys' fees.</p>
    <p>Hazardous Materials and Indemnification:</p>
    <p>Tenant is restricted to use of the Premises for executive, sales and administrative purposes. For the restrictions on use and/or handling of hazardous and toxic material, see Lease Article XXV.</p>
    <p>Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord, its beneficiaries, any managing agents and leasing agents of the Premises, and their respective agents, partners, officers, directors and employees harmless from all damages, costs, losses, expenses (including, but not limited to, actual attorney's fees and engineering fees) arising from or attributable to any breach by Tenant or any of its warranties, representations or covenants in Lease Article XXV. Tenant's obligations hereunder shall survive termination of this lease.</p>
    <p>DEFINITION OF TENANT DEFAULT:</p>
    <p>Any of the following events constitutes a default under the lease: failure by Tenant to pay monthly Rent when due, together with failure to pay within ten (10) days after Landlord serves Tenant with written notice of past due Rent; failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other provision of the lease, provided that such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice of such failure or, if the failure cannot be corrected within the ten (10) day period, provided that Tenant does not commence to correct the failure within the ten (10) day period and thereafter pursue the correction through to completion within a reasonable time, and in any case prior to such time as failure to complete the correction could result in violation of any law, rule, or ordinance; failure by Tenant to pay monthly Rent on time more than three (3) times during any twelve (12) month period, or failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other provision of the lease more than three (3) times during any twelve (12) month period; performance by Tenant of any act that results in the creation of a lien upon the Premises and fails to discharge the lien or post bond for the lien with Landlord as required by Lease Article XX; any attempt by Tenant to make an unpermitted assignment or sublease; failure by Tenant to maintain in force all insurance policies required by the lease, and such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice of such failure; the filing of a petition against Tenant or any guarantor of the lease under any section of the Bankruptcy Code (and in the case of an involuntary proceeding, the filing is not permanently discharged or vacated within sixty (60) days); if Tenant or any guarantor of the lease becomes insolvent or makes a transfer in fraud of creditors or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; a court-authorized appointment of a receiver, custodian, or trustee for substantially all Tenant assets or all assets of any guarantor of the lease is made and not subsequently vacated within sixty (60) days of the initial appointment date; the cumulative transfer of more than 50% interest in Anonymous Mortgage that results in Anonymous retaining less than a 50% interest Anonymous Mortgage.</p>
    <p>DEFAULT RECOURSE:</p>
    <p>In event of default, Landlord has the right to enter and take possession of the Premises and if Landlord elects, at Tenant's expense release the Premises and/or repair any damage for which Tenant is responsible. In the event that Landlord relets the Premises: Tenant is liable for all costs associated with the default and with recovery of the Premises; all accumulated Rent up to the time the Anonymous Mortgage lease is terminated; costs associated with preparing the Premises for new tenants; and any deficiency between the present value of rent payable by new tenants over the remaining Term and the present value of Anonymous Mortgage rent contracted in the current lease. The deficiency between the present value of total rent payable by the new tenant(s) and contracted total rent in the Anonymous Mortgage lease can be calculated either: before the new lease(s) are signed, on the basis of expected market rent; after the new lease(s) are signed, on the basis of actual rent specified in the new lease(s).</p>
    <p>INTERRUPTION OF RENT:</p>
    <p>Condemnation:</p>
    <p>If the entire Premises is acquired or condemned by eminent domain, the lease terminates as of the date the condemning authority takes possession, and total Rent due is adjusted to that date.</p>
    <p>If partial condemnation results in the loss by Landlord of at least five percent (5%) of the Building or ten percent (10%) of parking for the Building, then Tenant may elect to terminate the lease within thirty (30) days of final determination of the extent of the loss, termination to occur as of the date the condemning authority takes possession, and total Rent due is adjusted to that date.</p>
    <p>If Tenant has the option to terminate the lease but fails to exercise the option, then Landlord shall promptly restore the remaining Premises to a condition comparable to its condition immediately prior to condemnation and the lease shall continue as prior to the condemnation, except that after the effective date of condemnation the Rent shall be reduced as reasonably determined by Landlord if such reduction is reasonably warranted.</p>
    <p>Tenant waives any right or claim to any part of a compensatory award from the condemning authority to Landlord, and waives any claim against Landlord due to the condemnation.</p>
    <p>In any action of eminent domain involving the Premises, the grantor trust and the remainder interest holder make separate compensation claims against the condemning authority.</p>
    <p>Damage and Destruction:</p>
    <p>The Landlord shall carry rent business interruption insurance applicable to the Premises sufficient to cover Base Rent payments plus all related taxes and operating expenses for a period of 300 days. The cost of business interruption insurance will be reimbursed by the Tenant, including all related appraisal and consulting fees.</p>
    <p>If the Building or any portion thereof is damaged or destroyed to such an extent that it cannot be repaired within two hundred seventy days of the event, then the Tenant has the right to terminate the lease by giving the Landlord written notice within the later of (i) thirty (30) days after the event or (ii) five (5) business days after determination that the damage or destruction cannot be repaired within 270 days. The Landlord would continue to receive Base Rent for the period covered by business interruption insurance, and would have the right to relet the Premises after restoration for the remainder of the Term.</p>
    <p>In event of destruction or damage to the Building which does not result in lease termination but which renders the Building wholly or partially untenantable, Base Rent shall be abated in proportion to the area so rendered until restoration is completed. However, the Landlord would continue to receive the abated portion of Base Rent plus operating expenses while restoration is under way due to business interruption insurance, unless restoration took longer than 300 days.</p>
    <p>If the Building or any portion thereof is destroyed by fire or other cause during the last two (2) years of the lease term, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate the lease by giving written notice to the Landlord within sixty (60) days of the destruction. In this case, the Landlord would continue to receive Base Rent plus taxes and operating expenses from business interruption insurance for 300 days.</p>
    <p>TENANT FINANCIAL REPORTS:</p>
    <p>During each year of the Term, on no later than March 1, Anonymous Mortgage shall provide Landlord with a net worth report as of December 31 of the prior calendar year and the preceding year. The report shall be certified by a nationally recognized accounting firm.</p>
    <p>At any time during the Term, up to once per fiscal year, Tenant will, upon ten days prior notice from Trustee A, provide the Trustee with a current financial statement and financial statements for the two (2) preceding fiscal years. The statements will be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.</p>

The descriptions and summaries of various documents set forth in this Offering Memorandum do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and reference is made to each document for the complete details of all terms and conditions thereof. All statements contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to each document.

    <p>Kansas City Life Insurance Company</p>
    <p>The obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Kansas City Life Insurance Company, a Missouri company (“Kansas City Life” or the “Lease Guarantor”).</p>
    <p>Kansas City Life and its wholly-owned subsidiaries issue and market a full line of universal life, term and traditional whole life insurance and accident and health insurance products. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, Kansas City Life had consolidated revenues in the amount of $393.5 million, pre-tax income of $57.0 million and net income of $37.4 million. At Dec. 31, 1994, Kansas City Life had total assets of $2.7 billion and total stockholders' equity of $343.7 million. With respect to its claims paying ability, Kansas City Life has a rating from A.M. Best of “A+” and ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services of “A+” and “A2”, respectively. See “KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY.”</p>
    <p>The Certificates</p>
    <p>The Certificates offered hereby evidence undivided fractional interests in K.C. ABBE® Trust 1995-1, a special purpose grantor trust (the “Trust”). The Trust has been created and will be governed by the terms of a First Amended and Restated Term Trust Agreement, dated as of Aug. 25, 1995, between Scribcor, Inc. (the “Grantor”) and The First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (the “Trustee”). Holders of Certificates will be entitled to receive substantially all payments to be made on and after Aug. 25, 1995 (the “Closing Date”) by the sole tenant of the Old American Life Insurance Building, a three story commercial office building located at 4900 Oak Street in the Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City, Mo. (the “Property”) pursuant to the terms of a Lease, dated as of Dec. 29, 1989, as amended (the “Lease”). The obligations of the tenant under the Lease have been irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Kansas City Life.</p>
    <p>The Certificates will be dated the Closing Date, and Certificate Payments will be distributed to holders of Certificates on the 15th calendar day of each month (or, if the 15th calendar day of each month is not a Business Day, the following Business Day), commencing Sep. 15, 1995 and ending on Dec. 15, 2009.</p>
    <p>The Certificates will be issued in fully-registered book-entry form. Ownership interests in the Certificates will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by The Depository Trust Company, New York, N.Y. (“DTC”), and its participants. Owners of beneficial interests in the Certificates will be entitled to physical delivery of the Certificates in certificated form equal in amount to their respective beneficial interests only under certain circumstances. See “THE CERTIFICATES—Book-Entry Only System.”</p>
    <p>The Certificates will be subject to prepayment upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation. See “THE CERTIFICATES—Prepayment.”</p>
    <p>The Offering</p>
    <p>$9,040,000 aggregate amount of Certificates are being offered hereby at an offering price of $20,000 per Certificate to persons who satisfy the investor suitability requirements described under the caption “NOTICE TO INVESTORS.” The minimum subscription for each investor is one Certificate. The Grantor may, in its sole discretion, elect to accept subscriptions for fractional Certificates.</p>
    <p>The Trust</p>
    <p>The Trust is a special purpose grantor trust created and governed by the terms of a First Amended and Restated Term Trust Agreement, dated as of Aug. 25, 1995 (the “Trust Agreement”), between the Grantor and the Trustee. The Grantor has established the Trust by selling and assigning the Term Interest to the Trust in exchange for $8,305,000. Prior to such sale and assignment, the Trust had no assets or obligations or any operating history. The Trust will not engage in any activity other than acquiring and holding the Term Interest, receiving the Lease Payments with respect to the Lease and issuing the Certificates and distributing Certificate Payments pursuant to the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>Trust Property</p>
    <p>The property of the Trust (the “Trust Property”) consists solely of (i) a term-of-years real property interest expiring on Dec. 31, 2009 (the “Term Interest”) in and to the Property; (ii) the right, as landlord, to receive all payments (“Lease Payments”) to be made by the Tenant under the terms of the Lease; and (iii) the right to all monies and securities deposited or required to be deposited with the Trustee pursuant to any term of the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>The Term Interest</p>
    <p>The Term Interest is a real property interest and constitutes a vested (i.e., current) unencumbered estate-for-years in and to the Property expiring on Dec. 31, 2009. Following termination in 2009 of the Term Interest, the Trust will have no further interest in the Property. For federal income tax purposes, the Term Interest constitutes a depreciable asset, and the initial cost of the Term Interest to the Trust is recoverable under Section 167(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, by means of equal and ratable cost recovery deductions which may be taken by the Trust and passed through to holders of Certificates through 2009. See “THE TERM INTEREST.”</p>
    <p>The Property</p>
    <p>The Property consists of a 94,149 square foot office building (the “Building”) situated on a 2.091 acre parcel in the Country Club Plaza District of Kansas City, Mo. The Country Club Plaza District is located approximately 4.5 miles south of Downtown Kansas City. The Building was constructed in 1960 and substantial renovations were completed by Kansas City Life for approximately $1.5 million on the Building in 1992. The Building has been subleased to The Ewing Kauffman Foundation (the “Subtenant”) through 1997. See “THE BUILDING AND THE PROPERTY.”</p>
    <p>Property Acquisition and Bridge Financing</p>
    <p>On May 4, 1995, the Grantor acquired a fee simple interest in the Property for a purchase price of $10,455,000. Following Grantor's acquisition of the entire fee simple interest in the Property, the Grantor “split” the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Trust the Term Interest expiring in 2009 and (b) conveying or causing to be conveyed to a single purpose grantor trust (the “Remainder Trust”), in exchange for $2,150,000, a remainder interest in the Property, which remainder interest will entitle the beneficiaries of the Remainder Trust, upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.</p>
    <p>The Grantor established the Trust by assigning and selling the Term Interest to the Trust in exchange for $8,305,000, which amount was contributed to the Trust by K.C. ABBE Holdings, L.L.C. (“Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company of which the sole members (equity holders) are principals of the Grantor or spouses thereof. Holdings was formed to facilitate the purchase of the Property pending completion of the offering of the Certificates made hereby. Holdings financed its purchase of the beneficial interest in the Trust representing the Term Interest by incurring bank indebtedness in the amount of $8,300,000, which indebtedness and accrued interest thereon will be discharged with the proceeds of the offering of Certificates made hereby. See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS.”</p>
    <p>The Lease</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the terms of a Lease, dated as of Dec. 29, 1989, as amended (the “Lease”), the Property has been leased to the Tenant for an initial term expiring on Dec. 31, 2009. The Lease is a so-called “triple net” lease, with Tenant assuming responsibility for taxes, insurance and operating expenses, obligations for repair and maintenance, and certain condemnation and casualty risks associated with the Building. See “INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS—Absolute Net Lease”.</p>
    <p>The Servicer</p>
    <p>Upon acquisition of the Property and creation of the Term Interest, the Trust was assigned all rights of the landlord under the Lease. Pursuant to the terms of a Servicing Agreement, dated as of Aug. 25, 1995 (the “Servicing Agreement”), between the Trustee and Scribcor, Inc. (the “Servicer”), the Servicer has been authorized to act as agent for the Trustee with respect to (a) monitoring the performance of the Tenant under the Lease, (b) undertaking certain collection obligations of the landlord under the Lease and (c) pursuing, on behalf of the Trustee, certain remedies available to landlord under the Lease upon the occurrence of a default thereunder. See “THE SERVICING AGREEMENT.”</p>
    <p>Scribcor, Inc., founded in 1891, is a privately-held firm focusing on management, leasing and consulting in the Midwest commercial and industrial real estate market. At Mar. 31, 1995, the Servicer managed in excess of 3.5 million square feet of commercial office space, and clients of the Servicer include Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company and IBM Corporation.</p>
    <p>Security</p>
    <p>The Certificates represent beneficial interests in, and unsecured obligations of, the Trust only and do not represent interests in or obligations of the Grantor, the Tenant or Kansas City Life. The Trust will not hold a mortgage on the Building.</p>
    <p>The Trust will hold title directly to the Term Interest, which will expire and terminate in 2009. As holder of the Term Interest, the Trust will be entitled to receive all rents and profits derivable from the Building (including all Lease Payments under the Lease) through, but only through, Dec. 31, 2009.</p>
    <p>The Grantor and Affiliates</p>
    <p>Scribcor, Inc. (the “Grantor”) is the grantor of the Trust and will serve as the Servicer under the Trust Agreement. The Grantor is an affiliate of Electrum Partners L.L.C. (“Electrum”), a newly-formed Illinois limited liability company.</p>
    <p>The principal officers and majority owners of Electrum are Richard M. Ross, Jr. and Richard A. Graff. Principals of Electrum have been engaged for over the past three years developing the conceptual debt/equity model which serves as the basis for the financing contemplated hereby.</p>
    <p>Mr. Ross is President of Scribcor, Inc., and has been associated with Scribcor in various administrative capacities since 1971. Scribcor, founded in 1891, is a privately-held firm focusing on management, leasing and consulting in the Chicago commercial and industrial real estate market. During his 23-year tenure with Scribcor, Mr. Ross has directed complex transactions for major institutional clients, including site acquisition, financing, office relocation, development consulting and property management. He has provided confidential consulting services to numerous major corporations. Mr. Ross is a graduate of Denison University and holds an MBA in Finance from the University of Chicago. He is a member of the American Society of Real Estate Counselors (ASREC) and the Urban Land Institute.</p>
    <p>Over the last nine years, Mr. Graff developed the investment theory and legal structure that forms the basis for the Electrum's proprietary financial technology. Mr. Graft is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He holds MA and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Princeton University and an MBA in Finance from the University of Chicago. He is an author of several widely recognized articles on innovations in real estate finance and investments that have appeared or are scheduled to appear in various professional and academic real estate and financial publications.</p>
    <p>Investment Considerations</p>
    <p>An investment in the Certificates involves certain risks. See “INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS.”</p>
    <p>Certain Tax Matters</p>
    <p>In the opinion of Kirkland &amp; Ellis, special tax counsel to the Grantor, the Trust will be classified for Federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Accordingly, each holder of a Certificate will be subject to Federal income taxation as if it owned directly its proportionate interest in each asset owned by the Trust.</p>
    <p>In the opinion of Kirkland &amp; Ellis, for Federal income tax purposes the Term Interest constitutes a depreciable asset and the initial cost of the Term Interest to the Trust is recoverable under Section 167(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, by means of equal and ratable cost recovery deductions which may be taken by the Trust and passed through to holders of Certificates through 2009. See “FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS.”</p>
    <p>Investor Suitability</p>
    <p>Certificates will be offered and sold solely to “qualified institutional buyers” (“QIBs”), as such term is defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in compliance with Rule 144A. See “NOTICE TO INVESTORS.”</p>
    <p>Rating</p>
    <p>Standard &amp; Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (“S&amp;P”), has assigned the Certificates a rating of “A+”. A rating reflects only the views of S&amp;P and an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from S&amp;P. Once assigned, there is no assurance that any rating will continue for any given period of time, or that it will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the issuing rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or withdrawal of a rating assigned to the Certificates may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Certificates. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. See “RATING.”</p>
    <p>INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS</p>
    <p>Single Purpose Issuing Entity</p>
    <p>The Certificates will be issued by K.C. ABBE® 1995-1 Trust, a special purpose grantor trust created solely for the purpose of purchasing the Term Interest. The Trust will not engage in any activity other than acquiring and holding the Trust Property, issuing the Certificates, receiving Lease Payments and distributing Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates.</p>
    <p>Unconditional Lease Guaranty</p>
    <p>The obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed, as to payment and not as to collection, by Kansas City Life Insurance Company. At Dec. 31, 1994, the obligation of Kansas City Life represented by the Guaranty had been capitalized for financial reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. See Kansas City Life's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.</p>
    <p>Kansas City Life Insurance Company</p>
    <p>Kansas City Life and its wholly-owned subsidiaries issue and market a full line of universal life, term and traditional whole life insurance and accident and health insurance products. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, Kansas City Life had consolidated revenues in the amount of $393.5 million, pre-tax income of $57.0 million and net income of $37.4 million. At Dec. 31, 1994, Kansas City Life had total assets of $2.7 billion and total stockholders' equity of $343.7 million. With respect to its claims paying ability, Kansas City Life has a rating from A.M. Best &amp; Co. of “A+” and ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service of “A+” and “A2”, respectively.</p>
    <p>Absolute Net Lease</p>
    <p>The Lease is an absolute “triple net” lease, with Tenant assuming responsibility for all taxes, insurance and operating expenses, obligations for repair and maintenance (including structural repair and maintenance) and condemnation and casualty loss risks associated with the Building.</p>
    <p>Capital Expenditures. The Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, has no obligation under the Lease to make capital expenditures with respect to the Building. Tenant is required, at its sole cost and expense, to keep the Building and all parts thereof in good order, repair and condition, whether interior or exterior, structural or non-structural, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, including, without limitation, repair of all glass, utilities, conduits, fixtures, equipment, foundations, roofs, exterior and interior walls, heating and air conditioning systems, lighting fixtures, wiring, plumbing, sprinkler systems, paving, sidewalks, roads, parking areas, curbs, gutters and fences. The necessity for and adequacy of all repairs to be made to the Building pursuant to the Lease shall be measured by the standard which is appropriate for suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area of similar construction, class and age.</p>
    <p>Casualty Loss Risk. If the Building, or any part thereof, is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term of the Lease (except during the second to last and final year of the term), Tenant is obligated to promptly repair or restore the Building to substantially the same condition it was in immediately prior to such fire or casualty, and Tenant's obligation to pay Base Rent and to perform its other obligations under the Lease will not be suspended, abated or reduced as a result thereof.</p>
    <p>In the event of (a) damage or destruction during the second to last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 75% of the replacement value of the Premises) or (b) damage or destruction during the last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 25% of the replacement value of the Building), the Trustee (in its capacity as landlord under the Lease) or Tenant may terminate the Lease, provided that any and all insurance proceeds in such case received by Tenant are required to be paid to and assigned to the Trust, as landlord. In each such case, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease and pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, is obligated to utilize such insurance proceeds to restore the Building to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to such Casualty Loss Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not have the right to terminate the Lease if (a) any damage or destruction is caused by an uninsured casualty, (b) Tenant shall have failed to maintain the insurance required to be maintained under the Lease or (c) Landlord is unable for any reason to collect all insurance proceeds which would otherwise be payable by Tenant's insurance carriers in connection with such damage or destruction. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, has been irrevocably instructed not to exercise its right to terminate the Lease upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Casualty Loss.”</p>
    <p>In accordance with the terms of the Lease, Tenant is required to maintain all-risk property and casualty insurance for the full (100%) replacement cost of the Property (with a deductible of not more than $25,000). See “THE LEASE—Insurance.” The Trustee is required pursuant to the Trust Agreement to procure rental interruption insurance in an amount sufficient to assure that holders of Certificates will receive when due monthly Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates. There can be no assurance that receipt by the Trustee of any such casualty insurance or rental interruption insurance proceeds will be at such time or times sufficient to assure timely payment with respect to the Certificates. See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Rental Interruption Insurance.”</p>
    <p>Condemnation Risk. If less than 50% of the Building shall be taken by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, or the use or occupancy of the Premises or any part thereof shall be temporarily requisitioned by any governmental authority, civil or military, then the Lease shall continue in full force and effect without abatement or reduction of Base Rent, additional rent or other sums payable by Tenant. In such event, Tenant is obligated after such taking or requisition, at its sole cost and expense, to repair any damage caused by any such taking or requisition in conformity with the provisions in the Lease governing the making of alterations to the Building.</p>
    <p>If condemnation shall effect at least 50% of the Building and, in Tenant's reasonable judgment, shall render the Building unsuitable for restoration for continued use and occupancy (a “Total Condemnation”), then Tenant shall terminate the Lease and submit an irrevocable offer to purchase from the Term Trust (a) any remaining portion of the Building and (b) the right to receive the net proceeds, if any, payable in connection with such condemnation. The purchase price shall be equal to ten times the then-annual Base Rent payable under the Lease, which amount will not be less than $9,326,500 and which amount will in all cases be equal to or greater than the then-applicable Prepayment Amount. In accordance with the terms of the Trust, the Trustee is required to accept such offer to purchase, and proceeds received by the Trust from the Tenant upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation will be distributed, first, to holders of Certificates to the extent of the then-applicable Prepayment Amount, and second, if and only to the extent of any remaining proceeds, to the Remainder Trustee for distribution to holders of Remainder Trust Certificates.</p>
    <p>Environmental Risk. In connection with the acquisition of the Property, the Grantor engaged Environment Audit Incorporated, Lee's Summit, Mo., to perform a Phase I environmental assessment of the Property. The Phase I assessment revealed no matters of significance with respect to non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease, Tenant has agreed to defend, indemnify and hold the Trust, as landlord under the Lease, harmless from and against any and all claims, including without limitation wrongful death actions and third-party claims (but excluding claims for consequential damages) arising directly or indirectly from the presence of any Hazardous Material (as defined in the Lease) in, on, under, at or about the Property or any Hazardous Discharge (as defined in the Lease) in, on, under, at or about the Property, or any environmental complaint.</p>
    <p>Depreciability of Term Interest</p>
    <p>For Federal income tax purposes, the Term Interest constitutes a depreciable asset, the cost of which is subject to equal and ratable cost recovery deductions through Dec. 31, 2009. See “FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS”.</p>
    <p>Remedies of Trust Upon Tenant Default</p>
    <p>The Trust will hold title directly to the Term Interest, which constitutes a current real property interest which will expire and terminate on Dec. 31, 2009, and the Trust will be the primary assignee and beneficiary of the Guaranty. The Trust will not hold a mortgage on the Property. As direct holder of the Term Interest, upon a default by the Tenant the Trustee (as landlord under the Lease) will be entitled to seek enforcement of its rights and remedies in accordance with the terms of the Lease and without resort to mortgage foreclosure or other judicial proceedings which otherwise might be required to realize upon a security interest in the Property.</p>
    <p>OFFERING TERMS</p>
    <p>The Trust is offering hereby a total of 452 Certificates at an offering price of $20,000 per Certificate and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The purchase price will be payable in full upon subscription. The minimum subscription is one Certificate. The Grantor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to accept subscriptions for fractional Certificates, so long as the minimum subscription requirement is met. The Certificates will be sold only to such persons who meet the suitability standards set forth under “NOTICE TO INVESTORS.”</p>
    <p>KANSAS CITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the terms of a Guaranty, dated as of Nov. 13, 1991 (the “Guaranty”), from Kansas City Life, the obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Kansas City Life. A copy of the Guaranty is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Tenant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kansas City Life. The obligation of Kansas City Life represented by the Guaranty has been capitalized for financial reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
    <p>Kansas City Life and its wholly-owned subsidiaries issue and market a full line of universal life, term and traditional whole life insurance and accident and health insurance products. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, the Lease Guarantor had consolidated revenues in the amount of $393.5 million, pre-tax income of $57.0 million and net income of $37.4 million. At Dec. 31, 1994, the Lease Guarantor had total assets of $2.7 billion and total stockholders' equity of $343.7 million. With respect to its claims paying ability, Kansas City Life has a rating from A.M. Best of “A+” and ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service of “A+” and “A2”, respectively.</p>
    <p>Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a copy of the Kansas City Life's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, in the form as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
    <p>ANNUAL CERTIFICATE PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS</p>
    <p>For a comparison of the Lease Payments of Base Rent required to be made by the Tenant under the Lease with the Certificate Payments required to be made with respect to the Certificates, see Exhibit C.

    <p>On May 4, 1995, the Grantor acquired a fee simple interest in the Property for a purchase price of $10,455,000. Immediately following Grantor's acquisition of the entire fee simple interest in the Property, the Grantor “split” the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Trust the Term Interest expiring in 2009 and (b) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Remainder Trust, in exchange for $2,150,000, a remainder interest in the Property, which remainder interest will entitle holders of certificates evidencing interests in the Remainder Trust (“Remainder Trust Certificates”), upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.</p>
    <p>The Grantor established the Trust by assigning and selling the Term Interest to the Trust in exchange for $8,305,000, which amount was contributed to the Trust by K.C. ABBE Holdings, L.L.C. (“Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company of which the sole members (equity holders) are principals of the Grantor or spouses thereof. Holdings was formed to facilitate the purchase of the Property pending completion of the offering of the Certificates made hereby. Holdings financed its purchase of the beneficial interest in the Trust representing the Term Interest by incurring bank indebtedness (the “Bridge Financing”) in the amount of $8,300,000, which indebtedness and accrued interest thereon will be discharged with the proceeds of the offering of Certificates made hereby. See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS”.</p>
    <p>ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS</p>
    <p>Set forth below is a summary of the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the (a) purchase of the Property by the Grantor for $10,455,000, (b) sale by the Grantor to Holdings of the Term Interest to the Trust, (c) the sale by the Grantor of the Remainder Interest to the Remainder Trust and the issuance of the Remainder Trust Certificates, (d) the cash flow attributable to the Certificates purchased by Holdings during the interim period May 4, 1995 to date (the “Interim Period”), and (e) the issuance of the Certificates offered hereby. The information set forth below represents the best estimate of the Grantor and is subject to change.</p>

    <p>THE TERM INTEREST</p>
    <p>Background</p>
    <p>Academics and real estate finance specialists have generally accepted the notion that commercial real estate leased on a so-called “bondable” basis (i.e., obligating the tenant, among other things, to pay all maintenance, insurance and tax expenses to assume certain condemnation, environmental and structural repair risks) to credit-worthy tenants can be divided conceptually into two components: a bond-equivalent component and a “residual”, or equity, component. The bond-equivalent component represents the value on a net present value basis of the expected payments under the bondable lease, discounted at a rate appropriate to the duration of the lease and the credit-worthiness of the tenant. The bond-equivalent component is comparable in many respects to a intermediate-term, non-callable fixed-income security. In contrast, the “residual”, or equity, component represents the value of commercial real estate after the cash flows generated by the bond-equivalent component have been eliminated—i.e., the net present value of the future right to occupy the real estate upon expiration of the term of the lease. Legally, the bond-equivalent component can be simulated by creating a term-of-years of a duration co-terminous with the term of the triple-net lease, while the equity component in a particular property represents an interest in a vested (i.e., current) unencumbered remainder interest in fee simple title to such property. This unencumbered remainder interest will entitle the holder of such interest to future possession and control of the property on a debt-free basis following the termination of the underlying term-of-years.</p>
    <p>The Term Interest</p>
    <p>The Term Interest is a real property interest and constitutes a vested (i.e., current) unencumbered estate-for-years in and to the Property expiring on Dec. 31, 2009. Following termination in 2009 of the Term Interest, the Trust will have no further interest in the Property. For Federal income tax purposes, the Term Interest constitutes a depreciable asset, the cost of which is subject to equal and ratable cost recovery deductions through Dec. 31, 2009. See “FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS”.</p>
    <p>Acquisition of the Property and Creation of Term Interest</p>
    <p>On May 4, 1995 the Grantor purchased for $10,455,000 the entire fee simple interest in the Property, which consists of a 94,149 square foot office building (the “Building”) situated on a 2.091 acre parcel in the Country Club Plaza District of Kansas City, Mo. The Country Club Plaza District is located approximately 4.5 miles south of Downtown Kansas City. The Building was constructed in 1960 and substantial renovations were completed by Kansas City Life on the Building for approximately $1.5 million in 1992, and the Subtenant has made significant expenditures to maintain the space in a manner commensurate with a Class A office building space. The $10,455,000 purchase price represents a capitalization of the Building's operating income for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994 at a rate of 8.93%, a capitalization of projected operating income for the year ending Dec. 31, 2000 at a rate of 10.27% and a capitalization of projected operating income for the year ending Dec. 31, 2005 at a rate of 11.81%.</p>
    <p>Immediately following Grantor's acquisition of the entire fee simple interest in the Property pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Grantor “split” the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Trust the Term Interest expiring on Dec. 31, 2009 and (b) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Remainder Trust for $2,150,000 a remainder interest in the Property, which remainder interest will entitle the beneficiaries of the Remainder Trust, upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.</p>
    <p>The Grantor established the Trust by assigning and selling the Term Interest to the Trust in exchange for $8,305,000, which amount was contributed to the Trust by K.C. ABBE Holdings, L.L.C. (“Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company of which the sole members (equity holders) are principals of the Grantor or spouses thereof. Holdings was formed to facilitate the purchase of the Property pending completion of the offering of the Certificates made hereby. Holdings financed its purchase of the beneficial interest in the Trust representing the Term Interest by incurring bank indebtedness in the amount of $8,300,000, which indebtedness and accrued interest thereon will be discharged with the proceeds of the offering of Certificates made hereby. See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS”.</p>
    <p>Prior to such initial sale and assignment, the Trust had no assets or obligations or any operating history. The Trust has not and will not engage in any activity other than acquiring and holding the Trust Property, receiving Lease Payments from the Tenant pursuant to the Lease, issuing the Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement and distributing Certificate Payments to Certificateholders.</p>
    <p>THE LEASE</p>
    <p>The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Lease. This summary is not a complete description of the terms of the Lease, and reference is made to the Lease for its detailed provisions. A copy of the Lease, as amended, is attached hereto as Exhibit E. All references herein to the “Landlord” are to the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease. Section references are to the corresponding provisions of the Lease, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference thereto.</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the Lease, the Tenant has leased during the Initial Term (as defined below) the Property, which contains all 94,149 rentable square feet of office space in the Old American Life Insurance Building (the “Building”), comprised of (i) 66,369 rentable square feet of office space on floors 1 through 3 of the Building and (ii) 27,780 rentable square feet of space in the Building's basement, which is utilized as a cafeteria, print shop and other office service facilities and (iii) the Building's three-story covered parking garage, containing spaces for 250 cars. The term “Premises,” as used herein, shall refer to the Property (including the Building).</p>
    <p>Term</p>
    <p>The initial 20-year term of the Lease (the “Initial Term”) commenced on Dec. 29, 1989 and will expire on Dec. 31, 2009, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Lease pertaining to casualty loss or condemnation or the exercise of the Landlord's remedies under the Lease. The Tenant has the option to extend the term of the Lease for two additional periods of five years (each, a “Renewal Term”). The Initial Term and the Renewal Terms are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the “Term.”</p>
    <p>In the event that the Property has been subleased to not more than two subtenants, for a term, including renewals, which shall expire not more than three years after the expiration of the Term, the Tenant shall have the right, at its option, to renew the Term for an additional period of either one, two or three years, so that the Term, as so renewed, shall expire after the expiration of such subleases; provided, Tenant shall have no further right to renew or extend the Term of the Lease. (Article III.D.) Base Rent</p>
    <p>The Tenant is obligated to pay the annual base rent (“Base Rent”) in equal installments on the first day of each month during the Term, without any right of set-off or deduction whatsoever. The annual and monthly Base Rent prescribed by the Lease during each year during the Initial Term and Renewal Terms is as follows:</p>

    <p>Net Lease</p>
    <p>The Lease is a so-called “triple-net” lease—i.e., it is the intent of Landlord and Tenant that the Lease will yield, net to Landlord, the Base Rent as above specified, and that all costs and expenses relating to the Premises shall be paid by the Tenant. (Article V.A.) Accordingly, in addition to Base Rent, the Tenant shall pay as additional rent, without right of reduction, set-off or abatement, all costs and expenses relating to the Premises, including taxes, utility expenses and costs of insurance, and repair and maintenance expenses, all as more fully described below.</p>
    <p>Taxes</p>
    <p>Tenant has agreed to pay as additional rent, before any fine or costs may be added for nonpayment, all real estate taxes, assessments, water and sewer rents, rates and charges, ad valorem taxes, gross receipts taxes, sales and use taxes, and other similar governmental charges which may at any time during the Term be assessed in respect of the Premises and to furnish to Landlord official receipts or other satisfactory proof evidencing such payment. (Article VI.A.)</p>
    <p>Repairs and Maintenance</p>
    <p>Tenant is required, at its sole cost and expense, to keep the Premises and all parts thereof, including without limitation, all sidewalks, curbs, parking areas, access ways and landscaped areas, in good order, repair and condition, whether interior or exterior, structural or nonstructural, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, including, without limitation, repair of all glass, utilities, conduits, fixtures, equipment, foundations, roofs, exterior and interior walls, heating and air conditioning systems, lighting fixtures, wiring, plumbing, sprinkler systems, paving, sidewalks, roads, parking areas, curbs, gutters and fences. The necessity for and adequacy of all repairs to be made to the Premises pursuant to the Lease shall be measured by the standard which is appropriate for suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area of similar construction, class and age. (Article VII.A.)</p>
    <p>If, during the last twelve months of the Term, Tenant is required pursuant to any applicable legal requirement to make structural repairs or alterations to the Premises (a “Mandated Repair”), then in such case if a Mandated Repair must be completed prior to the expiration of the Term, Tenant shall be responsible for completing the Mandated Repair at its sole cost and expense. If, however, a Mandated Repair may be completed over a period of time which extends beyond the expiration of the Term, but work on such Mandated Repair must be commenced prior to the expiration of the Term, then in such event Tenant is required to commence the work on the Mandated Repair and is obligated to pay that portion of the work which is equal to the result obtained by pro rating the total cost of the Mandated Repair over the period of time during which such Mandated Repair may or must be completed and allocating to Tenant the amount allocable to the balance of the Term. (Article VII.C.)</p>
    <p>Utilities and Services</p>
    <p>Landlord is not required to furnish any utilities or services to Tenant. Tenant is responsible for the procurement of and payment for all charges for electricity, power, gas, steam, water, telephone and other utilities and services, including without limitation, cleaning and maintenance services used in connection with the Premises. (Article XI).</p>
    <p>Insurance</p>
    <p>Tenant shall maintain at all times, at its sole cost and expense, insurance coverage as follows:</p>
    <p>1. All-risk property insurance for the full (100%) replacement cost of the Property (with a deductible of not more than $25,000);</p>
    <p>2. Commercial general public liability insurance against claims for bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on or about the Premises in a single limit amount of $10,000,000 with respect to bodily injury or death arising out of any one accident or occurrence;</p>
    <p>3. Boiler and machinery insurance in the amount of at least $1,000,000 (with a deductible of not more than $10,000);</p>
    <p>4. Worker's compensation insurance to the extent required by law;</p>
    <p>5. During any period of construction with respect to the Building, builders' risk insurance on a completed value basis for the total cost of any alterations;</p>
    <p>6. If and to the extent such insurance is commonly obtained by prudent owners of suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area, environmental impairment insurance in such amounts as are commonly obtained by such prudent owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be required to carry such environmental impairment insurance so long as its net worth exceeds Tenants Minimum Net Worth (as defined) (and further provided that, to the extent that Tenant is required to carry such insurance because its net worth is equal to or less than Tenant's Minimum Net Worth, Tenant may maintain a deductible with respect to such insurance of not more than 5% of its net worth);</p>
    <p>7. Such other insurance in such amounts as are commonly obtained at the time in question by prudent owners of suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area.</p>
    <p>For purposes of the foregoing paragraph (6), “Tenant's Minimum Net Worth” is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $50,000,000 or (ii) the product of (1) 50 times (2) the Base Rent and taxes with respect to the Premises payable by the Tenant in the then-current calendar year. All insurance maintained by Tenant with respect to the Premises must name Landlord as an additional insured as its interest may appear. In addition, at the request of Landlord, but not more than once every three years, Tenant at Tenant's sole cost and expense shall increase the limits of liability on any of the insurance policies Tenant is otherwise required to maintain to such greater amounts as Landlord shall reasonably request. (Article XI)</p>
    <p>All insurance required to be maintained by Tenant shall be written by companies of nationally recognized financial standing, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee in its capacity as landlord under the Lease. The Trust Agreement further provides that the Trustee will not accept insurance written by any company, unless such company has a claims paying rating of “BBB+” or better as determined by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation.</p>
    <p>All proceeds of insurance maintained by Tenant under the Lease shall be payable to and administered by the Trustee under the terms of the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>Fire and Other Casualty</p>
    <p>In the event of (a) damage or destruction during the second to last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 75% of the replacement value of the Premises) or (b) in the event of damage or destruction during the last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 25% of the replacement value of the Premises) (each such events in clause (a) and (b) a “Casualty Loss”), then in each such event, Landlord or Tenant, upon 30 days' written notice to the other, may terminate the Lease, provided that any and all insurance proceeds in such case received by Tenant are required to be paid to and assigned to Landlord. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not have the right to terminate the Lease if (a) any damage or destruction is caused by an uninsured casualty, (b) Tenant shall have failed to maintain the insurance required to be maintained under the Lease or (c) Landlord is unable for any reason to collect all insurance proceeds which would otherwise be payable by Tenant's insurance carriers in connection with such damage or destruction. In accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, has been irrevocably instructed not to exercise its right to terminate the Lease upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Casualty Loss.” (Article XIV.B.)</p>
    <p>Upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss giving rise to a Casualty Loss Termination, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease and pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, is obligated to utilize such insurance proceeds to restore the Building to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to such Casualty Loss Termination. The Trustee is required pursuant to the Trust Agreement to procure rental interruption insurance in an amount sufficient to assure that holders of Certificates will receive when due monthly Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates. There can be no assurance that receipt by the Trustee of any such casualty insurance or rental interruption insurance proceeds will be at such time or times sufficient to assure timely payment with respect to the Certificates. See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Rental Interruption Insurance.”</p>
    <p>Condemnation</p>
    <p>Tenant has irrevocably assigned to Landlord any award or payment to which Tenant may be or become entitled by reason of any taking of the Premises or any part thereof by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, by any governmental authority, civil or military. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to any award or payment on account of Tenant's trade fixtures, equipment and moving expenses, to the extent Tenant shall have a right to make a separate claim therefor against the appropriate governmental authority. (Article XV.A.)</p>
    <p>If less than 50% of the Premises shall be taken by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, or the use or occupancy of the Premises or any part thereof shall be temporarily requisitioned by any governmental authority, civil or military, then the Lease shall continue in full force and effect without abatement or reduction of Base Rent, additional rent or other sums payable by Tenant. In such event, Tenant is obligated after such taking or requisition, at its sole cost and expense, to repair any damage caused by any such taking or requisition in conformity with the provisions in the Lease governing the making of alterations to the Premises. (Article XV.E.)</p>
    <p>If all or substantially all of the Property shall be taken by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings, then the Lease shall terminate on the day preceding the date of the vesting of title to the Premises or portion thereof in the condemning authority, and Base Rent and additional rent shall be paid to the date of such termination. (Article XV.B.)</p>
    <p>If condemnation shall affect at least 50% of the Premises and, in Tenant's reasonable judgment, shall render the Premises unsuitable for restoration for continued use and occupancy (a “Total Condemnation”), then Tenant shall, not later than 30 days after such condemnation, deliver to Landlord (i) notice of its intention to terminate the Lease on the next rental payment date which occurs not less than 90 days after the delivery of such notice (the “Condemnation Termination Date”), (ii) a certificate of an authorized officer of the Tenant describing the event giving rise to such termination and (iii) an irrevocable offer by Tenant to Landlord to purchase on the Condemnation Termination Date (a) any remaining portion of the Premises and (b) the right to receive the net proceeds, it any, payable in connection with such condemnation, at a price equal to ten times the then annual Base Rent. If Landlord shall reject such offer by notice given to Tenant not later than 15 days prior to the Condemnation Termination Date, the Lease shall terminate on the Condemnation Termination Date upon payment by Tenant of all Base Rent, additional rent and other sums then due and payable to and including the Condemnation Termination Date. (Article XV.C.) Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding any direction to the contrary of the Certificateholders, the Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement is irrevocably instructed to accept the Tenant's offer to purchase the Property required to be made upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation pursuant to the provisions of the Lease (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease). See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Condemnation.”</p>
    <p>Assignment and Subletting</p>
    <p>Tenant shall have the right to assign the Lease (in whole, but not in part) or to sublet the Premises (in whole or in part) without the consent of Landlord, provided that in the case of a subletting, no subletting shall be for a term ending later than one day prior to the expiration date of the Term. No assignment shall be deemed a waiver of any agreement, term, covenant or condition of the Lease or a release of Tenant from the performance or further performance by Tenant of the agreements, terms, covenants, conditions of the Lease, and Tenant shall continue to be primarily liable under the Lease in accordance with its terms. (Article XVI.A.)</p>
    <p>The merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all the assets of Tenant shall be deemed to be an assignment of the Lease. However, it shall be a condition precedent to the merger of Tenant into another corporation or the consolidation of the Tenant with one or more other corporations, that the surviving entity shall (i) have a minimum net worth at least equal to the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, (ii) deliver to Landlord a certified financial statement evidencing satisfaction of the requirement set forth in the foregoing clause (i), and (iii) deliver to Landlord an acknowledged instrument in recordable form assuming all obligations, covenants and responsibilities of Tenant under the Lease. (Article XVI.E.) See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Assignment of Lease.”</p>
    <p>Environmental Matters</p>
    <p>Tenant has agreed not to use, manufacture, store, dispose or sell any substance or material (collectively, “Hazardous Materials”) identified to be toxic, or hazardous according to any applicable federal, state or local statute, law, rule or regulation relating to regulation or control of toxic or hazardous substances or materials (“Environmental Laws”). If Tenant receives any written notice of any event involving the use, spill, discharge, dumping or clean-up of any Hazardous Material in at or about the Premises or into the sewer, septic system or waste treatment system servicing the Premises (any such event being hereinafter referred to as a “Hazardous Discharge”) or any complaint, order, citation or notice with regard to such Hazardous Discharge, then in such event Tenant shall give immediate oral and written notice of same to Landlord.</p>
    <p>For purposes of the Lease, the following event constitutes an Event of Default:</p>
    <p>If the Environmental Protection Agency, or any other local, state or federal agency asserts or creates a lien upon any or all the Premises by reason of (a) the presence of Hazardous Materials in, on, under, at or about the Premises, (b) the occurrence of a Hazardous Discharge, (c) an environmental complaint, or (d) any violation of any environmental law or otherwise; or if the EPA or any other local, state or federal agency asserts a written claim against Tenant, the Premises or Landlord for damages or clean-up costs related to the presence of Hazardous Materials, a Hazardous Discharge or an environmental complaint on or pertaining to the Premises; provided, however, such claim or lien shall not constitute a default if, within ten days after Tenant receives written notice of such lien or claim:</p>
    <p>(a) Tenant shall commence and shall thereafter pursue with due diligence either (i) the cure or correction of the event which constitutes the basis for the claim of lien and continues with due diligence to pursue such cure or correction to completion or (ii) proceedings for an injunction, restraining order or other appropriate proceedings are brought by Tenant with due diligence seeking relief of the matter giving rise to the claim and the relief thereby obtained is not thereafter reversed on appeal; and</p>
    <p>(b) In either of the foregoing events, Tenant shall have posted a bond, letter of credit or other security required by law satisfactory in form, substance and amount to the agency or entity asserting the claim to secure the proper and complete cure or correction of the event which constitutes the basis for the claim.</p>
    <p>Tenant has agreed to defend, indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, including without limitation wrongful death actions and third-party claims (but excluding claims for consequential damages) arising directly or indirectly from the presence of any Hazardous Material in, on, under, at or about the Premises or any Hazardous Discharge in, on, under, at or about the Premises, or any environmental complaint. (Article XIII.)</p>
    <p>Alterations</p>
    <p>Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, may make alterations or additions or other improvements to the Premises or any part thereof, provided that any alterations or additions (i) shall not reduce the fair market value of the Premises below its value immediately before such alteration or impair the usefulness or structural integrity of the Building or change the use thereof; (ii) shall not reduce the gross leaseable area of the Premises, (iii) are effected in good and workmanlike manner in a safe and careful fashion in compliance with all applicable legal requirements and (iv) are fully paid for by the Tenant. (Article VII.)</p>
    <p>Covenant Against Liens</p>
    <p>Tenant shall not permit any mechanics' or similar liens for labor or materials furnished to the Premises during the Term to be filed against the Premises or any part thereof and, if such lien shall be filed, Tenant shall either pay the same or procure the discharge thereof in any manner permitted by law within 30 days after such filing. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord and save Landlord harmless from and against any and all loss, damage, claims, liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses arising out of the filing of any such lien. (Article X.)</p>
    <p>Default Provisions; Landlord's Remedies</p>
    <p>The occurrence of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an “Event of Default”) under the Lease:</p>
    <p>1. Tenant's failure to pay any Base Rent, additional rent or any other sum required to be paid pursuant to the Lease, and such failure shall continue for 10 days after notice to Tenant of such failure. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is required to give notice to the Tenant within two days following the non-payment when due of any rent or other monies required to be paid by Tenant to the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease;</p>
    <p>2. The occurrence of an Event of Default described under “Environmental Matters” above;</p>
    <p>3. Tenant's failure to observe or perform any other provision of the Lease and such failure shall continue for 30 days after notice to Tenant of such failure;</p>
    <p>4. If Tenant shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall file a voluntary petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or an involuntary petition alleging any act of bankruptcy or insolvency shall be filed against Tenant, and the occurrence of certain other bankruptcy-related events, and in such case such events shall occur and continue without the acquiescence of Tenant for a period of 90 days;</p>
    <p>5. The occurrence of any event or contingency whereby the Lease or the estate thereby created or the unexpired balance of the Lease Term would, by operation of law or otherwise, devolve upon pass to any person, firm or corporation, except as expressly permitted in the Lease; or</p>
    <p>6. If Tenant shall abandon all of the Demised Premises by vacating the premises and failing to (i) maintain the premises, (ii) make all repairs thereto, (iii) maintain security and/or (iv) comply with all the terms, covenants and provisions thereof for a period in excess of 30 days.</p>
    <p>If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Landlord shall have the right to give Tenant a five-day notice of Landlord's termination of the Lease. Upon expiration of such five-day period, the Lease and the estate thereby granted shall expire and terminate, and all rights of Tenant under the Lease shall expire and terminate, but Tenant shall remain liable under the Lease as hereinafter provided. (Article XVIII.B.)</p>
    <p>Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Landlord shall have the following additional rights and remedies:</p>
    <p>1. Landlord shall have the right to reenter the Premises, to dispossess Tenant by a summary proceeding or other appropriate suit and, at Tenant's expense, to remove, for the sole benefit of Landlord, Tenant's effects and to hold the Premises and the right to receive all rental and other income of and from the Premises;</p>
    <p>2. In the case of any such reentry termination and/or disposition the Base Rent, Additional Rent and any other sums payable by Tenant under the Lease shall become immediately due and be paid up to the time of such reentry, disposition and/or termination, together with such reasonable expenses as Landlord may incur for legal expenses, attorneys' fees and disbursements; Landlord may relet the premises or any part or parts thereof for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term;</p>
    <p>3. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord as liquidated damages an amount equal to the Liquidated Damages Amount set forth in the Lease; and</p>
    <p>4. Landlord shall have the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as if reentry, summary proceedings and other remedies were not provided for in the Lease.</p>
    <p>In the event of any termination of the Lease or in the event that Landlord shall reenter the premises as above described, Tenant will pay to Landlord as liquidated damages, at the election of Landlord, either:</p>
    <p>(i) A sum equal to the excess, if any, discounted at 8% per annum, of (x) the full amount of Rent reserved under the Lease for the balance of the unexpired portion of the Initial Term, or a Renewal Term, as applicable, and the Additional Rent and other charges or sums payable by Tenant hereunder which would have been payable had the Lease not so terminated, over (y) the aggregate rental value of the Premises for the same period considered on a net rental basis, such sum to be immediately due in full upon such termination or reentry; or</p>
    <p>(ii) a sum which is equal to the aggregate of the Base Rent reserved under the Lease for the balance of the unexpired portion of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, and the Additional Rent and other charges or sums payable by Tenant thereunder which would have been payable by Tenant had the Lease not so terminated, or had Landlord not so reentered the Premises, payable upon the due dates specified in the Lease following such termination or such reentry and until the date for the expiration of the Initial Term or such Renewal Term, as applicable, as provided herein. (Article XVIII.E.)</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or the Servicer, as the case may be, will in all cases elect the measure of damages described above which will, in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee or Servicer, as the case may be, result in the maximum award to the Trustee in respect of such Event of Default.</p>
    <p>THE CERTIFICATES</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <p>The Certificates will be issued only in fully registered form. The Certificates will be issued in denominations of $20,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.</p>
    <p>The Certificates will be initially registered through a book-entry only system operated by The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). Details of payments of the Certificates and the book-entry only system are described below under the subcaption “Book-Entry Only System”. Except as described under the subcaption “Book-Entry Only System” below, beneficial owners of the Certificates will not receive or have the right to receive physical delivery of Certificates, and will not be or be considered to be the Owners thereof. Accordingly, beneficial owners must rely upon (i) the procedures of DTC and, if such beneficial owner is not a DTC Participant (as described below), the DTC Participant who will act on behalf of such beneficial owner to receive notices and payments of Lease Payments with respect to the Certificates, and to exercise voting rights and (ii) the records of DTC and, if such beneficial owner is not a DTC Participant, such beneficial owner's DTC Participant, to evidence its beneficial ownership of the Certificates. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of the Certificates, references herein to Holders or owners of such Certificates shall mean DTC or its nominee and shall not mean the beneficial owners of such Certificates. The laws of some states may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such limits and laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Certificate.</p>
    <p>If at any time the Holder of any Certificate shall request that its Certificate be registered in its name and not that of Cede &amp; Co., the Trustee shall promptly take such action as is necessary to authenticate and deliver to such Holder Certificates registered in its name or that of its nominee.</p>
    <p>Prepayment</p>
    <p>Except as set forth below and except for monthly Certificate Payments made in accordance with the payment schedule attached hereto as Exhibit C, the Certificates will not be prepaid, in whole or in part, prior to expiration of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009. The Certificates shall be prepaid prior to expiration of the Term Interest only upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation (see “THE LEASE—Condemnation” and “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Condemnation”) through the application of moneys on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account under the Trust Agreement. In each such case, prepayment shall be in an amount equal to the then-applicable Prepayment Amount specified in Appendix B to the Trust Agreement, but without premium.</p>
    <p>Certificate Payments</p>
    <p>The sole source of payment of Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates will be the Tenant's monthly Lease Payments of Base Rent under the Lease. The ability of the Trust to make timely Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates will be entirely dependent upon its receipt of timely Lease Payments by the Tenant under the Lease. Under the Trust Agreement and the Lease, the Tenant is required to make Lease Payments of Base Rent directly to the Trustee. The Trustee will apply these payments as described under “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Certificate Payments.”</p>
    <p>Book-Entry Only System</p>
    <p>The following information has been furnished by DTC for use in this Offering Memorandum and neither the Placement Agent nor the Grantor takes any responsibility for its accuracy or completeness.</p>
    <p>DTC will act as securities depository for the Certificates. The Certificates will be registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co. (DTC's partnership nominee). One fully-registered Certificate will be issued in the aggregate issuance amount and will be deposited with DTC.</p>
    <p>DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds securities that its participants (“Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among Participants of securities transactions, such as transfers and pledges, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in Participants' accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its Direct Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc., and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as securities brokers and dealers, banks, and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). The Rules applicable to DTC and its Participants are on file with the Commission.</p>
    <p>Purchases of the Certificates under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Certificates on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Certificate (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records. Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Certificates are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Except as otherwise provided herein, Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the Certificates, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Certificates is discontinued.</p>
    <p>To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Certificates deposited by Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede &amp; Co. The deposit of the Certificates with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede &amp; Co. effect no change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Certificates; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Certificates are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.</p>
    <p>Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.</p>
    <p>Neither DTC nor Cede &amp; Co. will consent or vote with respect to the Certificates. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Trust as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede &amp; Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Certificates are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).</p>
    <p>Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates will be made to DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Direct Participants' accounts on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on payable date. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, the Trustee, or the Trust, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of Certificate Payments to DTC is the responsibility of the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants shall be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.</p>
    <p>DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Certificates at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Grantor or the Trustee. Under such circumstances, if a successor securities depository is not obtained, certificates for the Certificates are required to be printed and delivered.</p>
    <p>The Trust may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, certificates for the Certificates will be printed and delivered.</p>
    <p>THE TRUST AGREEMENT</p>
    <p>Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement governing the terms of the Trust. The description and summaries of the Trust Agreement hereinafter set forth do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and reference is made to the Trust Agreement for the complete details of all terms and conditions. All statements herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Trust Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit D to this Offering Memorandum.</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions on which The First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee, shall hold the Term Interest. The Trust Agreement establishes the duties and obligations of the Trustee regarding the collection and distribution of funds and other administrative responsibilities relating to the Term Interest.</p>
    <p>Certificate Distribution Account</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement creates and establishes a special and segregated trust account, in the name of the Trustee on behalf of the Trust and for the benefit of Certificateholders (the “Certificate Distribution Account”), into which will be deposited (i) all monthly Lease Payments of rent made on or with respect to the Lease and (ii) Net Compensation payable upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation. The Certificate Distribution Account must be established at a bank or other financial institution (i) authorized pursuant to applicable laws to exercise corporate trust powers with respect to the Term Interest; (ii) having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities; and (iii) having (or having a parent which has) a long term unsecured debt rating of at least BBB+ by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation (an “Eligible Bank”).</p>
    <p>Funds in the Certificate Distribution Account will be invested as provided in the Trust Agreement in “Eligible Investments”. “Eligible Investments” are defined generally as</p>
    <p>(i) demand and time deposits in, or certificates of deposit of, any depository institution or trust company (including the Trustee) incorporated under the laws of the United States or any state thereof having a combined capital and surplus of at least $25,000,000 and subject to supervision and examination by federal and/or state banking authorities; provided, however, that such deposits shall be in amounts no greater than $100,000 for any one such depository institution or trust company unless the commercial paper or other unsecured short-term obligations of such depository institution or trust company are rated at least A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation;</p>
    <p>(ii) direct obligations of, and obligations fully guaranteed by, the United States of America, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, FNMA, Federal Farm Credit System, the Federal Home Loan Banks or any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the obligations of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America;</p>
    <p>(iii) bankers' acceptances issued by any depository institution or trust company (including the Trustee) meeting the requirements of clause (i) above; provided, however, that at the time of such investment or contractual commitment providing for such investment the commercial paper or other unsecured short-term debt obligations of such depository institution or trust company carry at least the ratings required under clause (i) above;</p>
    <p>(iv) repurchase obligations with respect to any securities described in clause (ii) above or any other security issued or guaranteed by any instrumentality of the United States of America, the obligations of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America; provided, however, that in either case, such security shall have a remaining maturity of one year or less and such repurchase obligation shall have been entered into with a depository institution or trust company (acting as principal) of the type described in the proviso to clause (iii) above; and</p>
    <p>(v) commercial paper (including both non-interest bearing discount obligations and interest bearing obligations payable on demand or on a specific date not more than one year after the date of issuance thereof) rated at least A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation.</p>
    <p>Investments of amounts on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account described below with respect to any Distribution Date are limited to obligations or securities that mature not later than the corresponding Distribution Date.</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement also creates and establishes a special and segregated trust account, in the name of the Trustee on behalf of the Trust and for the benefit of Certificateholders (the “Rating Agency Account”), into which the amount of $17,500 will be deposited by the Grantor initially on the Closing Date. The funds on deposit in the Rating Agency Account shall be used to fund the annual rating agency monitoring fee payable to Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation, which fee shall be payable annually in an amount not presently expected to exceed $2,000. Funds on deposit in the Rating Agency Account will be invested as provided in the Trust Agreement in Eligible Investments. If, upon termination of the Term Interest or earlier termination of the Trust (see “Termination of the Trust” below), there shall remain any unapplied balance in the Rating Agency Account, such unapplied balance shall be distributed to the Grantor.</p>
    <p>Certificate Payments</p>
    <p>The Servicer will deposit all Lease Payments made by the Tenant with respect to the Lease into the Certificate Distribution Account within two days of receipt by the Servicer thereof. On the 15th day of each month, commencing Sep. 15, 1995 and ending on Dec. 15, 2009 (each, a “Distribution Date”), the Trustee will distribute to each holder of Certificates as of the immediately preceding Record Date such holder's ratable share of the amount of Distributable Funds then on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account. Distributable Funds includes the total balance of funds then in the Certificate Distribution Account less the sum of: (i) $25,000; plus (ii) the amount of all Reimbursable Costs incurred by the Trustee for which the Trustee has not previously been reimbursed; plus (iii) the amount of all Reimbursable Costs reasonably anticipated by the Trustee to be incurred prior to the next succeeding Distribution Date; plus (iv) the amount of any Net Casualty Proceeds and/or any Net Compensation deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account pending application in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement; plus (v) any Additional Servicing Fee payable to the Servicer pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreement; plus (vi) the amount of any investment earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) on amounts on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account; plus (vii) the amount of any Trustee's fees payable pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee has a priority right to reimbursement of Reimbursable Costs incurred pursuant to the Trust Agreement from Lease Payments received by the Trustee and, if necessary, from the Trust Estate. On the Final Distribution Date, the Distributable Funds shall be calculated without regard to clauses (i), (iii) and (vi) above. On each Distribution Date, the Trustee will include with the distribution to each Certificateholder a statement itemizing Lease Payments received, Reimbursable Costs incurred and the calculation of the amount of Distributable Funds.</p>
    <p>For purposes of calculating Distributable Funds, “Reimbursable Costs” include all fees, expenses, costs or other charges incurred in good faith by the Trustee in the performance of its duties and obligations under the Trust Agreement. By way of example, Reimbursable Costs include all fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with the engagement by the Trustee of the Servicer and counsel to advise the Trustee regarding the discharge by the Trustee of its obligations under Section 6.2 of the Trust Agreement upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Casualty Loss Termination or Total Condemnation.</p>
    <p>General Duties of Trustee</p>
    <p>The Trustee shall generally have only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement relating to the administration of the Trust in the interest of the holders of the Certificates and is required to discharge such duties in accordance with its general obligations of loyalty and prudence as Trustee. In addition, the Trustee shall be required to give and receive all notices in respect of the Trust Estate as more specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>Specific Duties of Trustee</p>
    <p>Actions to be Taken By Trustee Upon Event of Default under Lease; Termination of Lease. The Trustee is required to engage the Servicer pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreement to monitor on behalf of the Trustee performance by the Tenant under the Lease, to give and receive notices required or appropriate to be given or received by the Trustee in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, and to otherwise perform on behalf of the Trustee its obligations, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement and the Servicing Agreement.</p>
    <p>If an Event of Default shall occur under the Lease, the Trustee must give, or cause the Servicer to give, notice thereof to the holders of Certificates and the Tenant within not less than two business days after the date the Trustee first obtains knowledge of the occurrence of such Event of Default. If so directed in writing by the holders of Certificates, the Trustee shall initiate, or cause the Servicer to initiate on its behalf, such actions, including the commencement of legal proceedings, as shall in the reasonable judgment of counsel retained by the Trustee for such purpose be necessary or appropriate to preserve the Trust Property and to enforce the rights and remedies of the Trust, in its capacity as the landlord under the Lease. All costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee in so acting shall constitute Reimbursable Costs. The Trustee shall not be required to take any action, incur any expense or advance any funds unless: (i) there shall then be on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account funds sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, to provide for reimbursement of all Reimbursable Costs incurred or to be incurred by the Trustee in acting at the direction of the holders of Certificates; or (ii) the Trustee shall have received assurances from the holders of Certificates as to the source and manner for the reimbursement of such Reimbursable Costs reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (clauses (i) and (ii) above being hereinafter referred to as the “Reimbursement Conditions”). If the Trustee shall seek such assurances and the holders of Certificates shall fail or refuse to provide the same within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor by the Trustee, such failure or refusal shall constitute a Termination Event and the Trustee shall be excused from taking any further action with respect to such Event of Default.</p>
    <p>If the Lease or Tenants right to possession of the Property thereunder shall be terminated in connection with an Event of Default, a Casualty Loss Termination or Total Condemnation (see “Casualty Loss; Casualty Loss Termination” and “Condemnation”, below), the Trustee shall direct the Servicer to provide usual and customary property and asset management services pursuant to the Servicing Agreement with respect to the Property pursuant to a written management agreement. The Trustee shall initiate such actions as are, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer and counsel engaged by the Trustee for such purpose, necessary and appropriate to (i) preserve the Trust Estate and maintain the Property, including the payment of property taxes, insurance premiums and other reasonable costs and expenses of maintaining and preserving the Property in good operating condition and (ii), if so directed in writing by the holders of Certificates, procure a Replacement Lease or Leases on such terms and conditions as shall be approved in writing by the Certificateholders. The Trustee shall not be required to take any such action unless the Reimbursement Conditions shall have been satisfied. A “Replacement Lease” is any lease for all or any portion of the Property, which lease (A) shall require the Tenant thereunder at its sole cost and expense to (i) maintain at least the insurance prescribed by the Lease, (ii) pay all ad valorem and other real property taxes levied against the Property and (iii) maintain or cause the Property to be maintained in good operating condition and in compliance with all applicable laws and (B) shall have been submitted to Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation (“S&amp;P”), and S&amp;P shall have confirmed that such Replacement Lease shall not result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of its then-assigned rating with respect to the Certificates.</p>
    <p>Casualty Loss. In the event of a Casualty Loss affecting the Property involving a loss in excess of $100,000, the Trustee is required to give written notice to the holders of Certificates within not less than five business days after the date the Trustee first obtains knowledge of such Casualty Loss. The Trustee shall establish at an Eligible Bank a segregated trust account (the “Casualty Account”), into which the Net Casualty Proceeds from such Casualty Loss shall be deposited in accordance with Article XIV of the Lease (or any comparable provision of any Replacement Lease), and the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, shall exercise the rights and remedies set forth under Article XIV of the Lease (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease) in connection with the restoration of the Property by the Tenant.</p>
    <p>If such Casualty Loss results in a Casualty Loss Termination of the Lease, the Trustee shall deposit into the Casualty Account the Net Casualty Proceeds, which shall be applied by the Trustee or, at its direction the Servicer, to restore the Property to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to the Casualty Loss Termination. In such event, the Servicer on behalf of the Trust shall obtain, within 45 days after such Casualty Loss, three fixed price bids for the performance of the work required in connection with the restoration of the Property from a “Qualified Contractor.” A “Qualified Contractor” is an experienced general contractor having (i) a net worth of at least $10,000,000; (ii) a five year annual average contract revenues of not less than $50,000,000; and (iii) not less than ten years of continuous business operation. The Trustee shall submit the three bids to the Certificateholders, who shall direct in writing the Trustee as to the bid to be selected not later than 30 days after receipt by the Certificateholders of such bids. If the holders of the Certificates fail or refuse to select one of the three bids within such 30-day period, the Servicer shall recommend to the Trustee the bid which, in the judgment of the Servicer exercised in accordance with the servicing standards set forth in the Servicing Agreement (see “THE SERVICING AGREEMENT—Duties of Servicer”), is the bid in the best interest of the Certificateholders, and the Trustee shall select such bid and proceed with the restoration. If the holders of Certificates shall direct the Trustee with respect to the taking of any actions in response to such Casualty Loss Termination, all fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Trustee in connection therewith shall be Reimbursable Costs. The Trustee shall have no obligation to take any such actions unless the Reimbursement Conditions are then met.</p>
    <p>For purposes of the Trust Agreement, a “Casualty Loss” is any loss or damage suffered or incurred with respect to the Property arising out of any fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake, act of God, war, strike or other casualty. A “Casualty Loss Termination” means any termination of the Lease resulting from the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, has been irrevocably instructed not to exercise its right to terminate the Lease upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. See “THE LEASE—Fire and Other Casualty.”</p>
    <p>Rental Interruption Insurance. Provided the same may be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, the Trustee shall, or shall cause the Servicer to, obtain and maintain at all times during the last two years of the Initial Term rental interruption insurance in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 125% of the Prepayment Amount applicable as of the first month of the penultimate year of the Initial Term; and (ii) the total rent payable under the Lease during the final two years of the Initial Term. Such rental interruption insurance shall be on such terms and conditions as shall be customary insuring the Trust against interruption of rental payments under the Lease, and the cost of such rental interruption insurance shall constitute a Reimbursable Cost under the Trust Agreement. Such rental interruption insurance shall be written by a company having a claims-paying ability rating of “BBB+” or better as determined by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation.</p>
    <p>To fund its obligations to maintain rental interruption insurance, the Trustee shall establish and maintain a segregated trust account (the “Rental Insurance Reserve Account”), into which shall be deposited from funds otherwise constituting Distributable Funds on the initial Distribution Date with respect to the Certificates the amount of $28,200. Funds in the Rental Insurance Reserve Account will be invested as provided in the Trust Agreement in Eligible Investments. If, after acquiring such rental interruption insurance during the last two years of the Initial Term, there shall remain any unapplied balance in the Rental Insurance Reserve Account, such unapplied balance shall be distributed to the Certificateholders.</p>
    <p>Condemnation. In the event of a Partial Condemnation affecting the Property, the Trustee shall deposit the Net Compensation received by the Trustee from such Partial Condemnation into a segregated trust account at an Eligible Bank (the “Condemnation Account”), and the proceeds therein shall be applied by the Servicer on behalf of the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Lease (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease) respecting payments to be made to the Tenant (or any Replacement Tenant) in connection with the restoration of the Property by the Tenant as required by the Lease. See “THE LEASE—Condemnation.” If, after making all payments of Net Compensation required to be made to the Tenant (or any Replacement Tenant) there shall remain any unapplied balance of the Net Compensation in the Condemnation Account, such unapplied balance shall be paid over to the Remainder Trustee.</p>
    <p>If there shall occur a Total Condemnation, the Trustee shall give written notice thereof to the Certificateholders not later than five business days after the Trustee shall have obtained knowledge of such Total Condemnation. Thereafter the Trustee shall, upon the written direction (or consent) of the Certificateholders, exercise the rights and perform the obligations of the Trust, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, under the provisions of the Lease governing a Total Condemnation (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease). Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding any direction to the contrary of the Certificateholders, the Trustee is irrevocably instructed to accept the Tenant's offer to purchase the Property required to be made upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation pursuant to the provisions of the Lease (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease). See “THE LEASE—Condemnation.” The proceeds received by the Trustee from such sale shall be thereupon deposited into the Certificate Distribution Account, and such proceeds shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement governing a Termination Event. See “—Termination of the Trust,” below.</p>
    <p>Termination of the Trust</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement and the trust created thereby will terminate upon the final distribution by the Trustee of all monies of the Trust Estate following the earlier of (i) Dec. 31, 2009, (ii) the occurrence of a Total Condemnation, or (iii) the failure of holders of Certificates to give to the Trustee certain financial assurances and indemnities upon the occurrence of a Event of Default under the Lease or upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss Termination (each such event set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) a “Termination Event”, and each event set forth in clause (iii) a “Section 6.2 Termination Event”). In no other event will the Trust Agreement terminate, and neither the Trustee nor the holders of the Certificates have the right to terminate the Trust Agreement. Within 30 days following the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Trustee shall give notice to the holders of the Certificates, which notice shall state (i) the Final Distribution Date at which time final payment of the Certificates shall be made upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office of the Trustee; (ii) the amount (if then known) of any such final payment; and (iii) that payments will be made only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office of the Trustee therein specified. Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Certificateholders amounts distributable on such Final Distribution Date. The Final Distribution Date shall be not later than (i), in the event of a Total Condemnation, 30 days following receipt by the Trustee of the Net Compensation payable in connection therewith; (ii), in the case of a sale of the Property following a Section 6.2 Termination Event, 30 days following receipt by the Trustee of the proceeds from such sale; and (iii) not later than 30 days following Dec. 31, 2009.</p>
    <p>Upon the occurrence of a Section 6.2 Termination Event, the Trustee shall give a termination notice with respect thereto to the Certificateholders and the Trustee shall thereafter sell the Property at an open outcry auction held in a commercially reasonable manner and on commercially reasonable terms on a date not earlier than 30 days and not later than 90 days after such termination notice has been given by the Trustee. Such termination notice shall specify the time, place and terms of such auction. The Trustee shall consult with the Servicer regarding the auctioneer to be engaged by the Trustee and the terms and conditions of the auction to be conducted thereby. The Servicer shall make a written recommendation to the Trustee regarding the identity of the auctioneer to be selected and the terms on which the auction should be conducted; provided, however, that in all events, the auctioneer will conduct any such auction (i) at the corporate trust office of the Trustee; (ii) on an open outcry basis with no reserve price or minimum bid; (iii) only after publication of the time and place for such auction in manner and with such publications as shall then be required to satisfy the requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code as then in effect in the jurisdiction in which such auction shall beheld, with respect to sales or collateral thereunder; (iv) pursuant to bidding rules that shall specify the form of purchase and sale agreement to be entered into between the Trustee and the successful bidder at the auction; and (v) substantially in accordance with the rules or procedures recommended by the Servicer and counsel engaged by the Trustee in connection with such auction. Certificateholders and any person controlling or controlled by, owning, owned by or under common ownership with any Certificateholder, shall not be entitled to participate in such auction.</p>
    <p>Upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation, the Trustee shall, in connection with the winding up of the Trust, distribute the Net Compensation (i) first, to the Certificateholders, to the extent of the applicable Prepayment Amount as determined pursuant to Appendix B of the Trust Agreement (or the amount of the Net Compensation, if the Net Compensation is less than the applicable Prepayment Amount) and (ii) second, the balance, if any, to the Remainder Trustee.</p>
    <p>Assignment of Lease</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee shall not consent to any assignment of the Lease or sublease of any material portion of the Real Property by the Tenant unless there shall then exist no default or Event of Default under the Lease, and either (i) after giving effect to the proposed assignment or sublease, the Tenant and the Guarantor under the Guaranty shall remain fully liable for each and every of the obligations of the Tenant under the Lease and shall confirm the same in writing to the Trustee and the proposed assignee or sublessee shall execute and deliver a written agreement agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Lease; or (ii) the Trustee shall have notified the Certificateholders in writing describing the proposed assignment or sublease and Certificateholders having at least a majority of the Voting Interests shall have approved in writing the proposed assignment or sublease. The Trustee has agreed to provide a copy of any notice given pursuant to this paragraph to Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation.</p>
    <p>Amendments</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement may be amended by the Trustee with the consent of the holders of 51% or more of the Voting Interests only for the limited purposes of (i) curing any ambiguity; (ii) correcting or supplementing any provision in the Trust Agreement that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision; (iii) as shall be required in connection with the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee in respect to the Trust Property; or (iv) and as may be required to facilitate the administration of the Trust under the Trust Agreement by more than one Trustee pursuant to Article VI of the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement may not otherwise be amended.</p>
    <p>The Trustee</p>
    <p>The First National Bank of Chicago will serve as Trustee. The Trustee, in its individual capacity or otherwise, and any of its affiliates, may hold Certificates in their own name or as pledgee. In addition, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of certain jurisdictions, the Trustee will have the power to appoint co-trustees or separate trustees of all or any part of the Trust. In the event of such appointment, all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Trustee by the Trust Agreement will be conferred or imposed upon the Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly or, in any jurisdiction where the Trustee is incompetent or unqualified to perform certain acts, singly upon such co-trustee or separate trustee who shall exercise and perform such rights, powers, duties and obligations solely at the direction of the Trustee.</p>
    <p>The Trustee may resign at any time, in which event the Certificateholders may appoint a successor trustee. The Certificateholders may also remove the Trustee if the Trustee ceases to be eligible to serve, becomes legally unable to act, is adjudged insolvent or is placed in receivership or similar proceedings.</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement provides that the fees and expenses of the Trustee constitute Reimbursable Costs, reimbursable from funds on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account created pursuant to the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>The Trustee's Corporate Trust Office is located at One First National Plaza, Suite 0126, Chicago, Ill. 60670-0126. The Seller and its affiliates may have other banking relationships with the Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of their respective businesses.</p>
    <p>The Administration Agreement</p>
    <p>The First Amended and Restated Administration Agreement, dated as of Aug. 25, 1995 (the “Administration Agreement”), between the Trustee and American National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, as Remainder Trustee, imposes certain notice and other obligations upon the Trustee and the Remainder Trustee. In particular, the Trustee is required to send to the Remainder Trustee copies of (i) all notices received from the Tenant or from Certificateholders after the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Lease; (ii) all notices sent to Certificateholders pursuant to any of the terms of Section 6.2 of the Trust Agreement (see “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Casualty Loss” and “—Condemnation”); and (iii) any notice pertaining to a Termination Event given or received by the Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>In addition, the Trustee shall provide to the Remainder Trustee, and if the Trust has not previously terminated, the Remainder Trustee shall provide to the Trustee, copies of all written materials, bid packages, invitations to bid, or other materials prepared by or for the Trustee or the Remainder Trustee, as the case may be, in connection with any auction to be held pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Trust Agreement or the provisions of the Remainder Trust Agreement, in each case so long as such materials are made generally available to potential bidders at such auction.</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Remainder Trustee shall have the right, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Trustee, to have the Property inspected during normal business hours not more than two times in each 12 calendar month period. Such inspection shall be performed in a manner so as to minimize, to the extent reasonably practicable, any disruption to the Tenant, and as otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the Lease.</p>
    <p>The Remainder Trustee has reserved any and all rights and remedies it may have, whether arising at law or in equity, to prevent the occurrence of waste at the Property, including without limitation, the commencement of any actions or legal proceedings against the Trustee or the Tenant as shall be deemed appropriate by the Remainder Trustee in its sole discretion.</p>
    <p>THE SERVICING AGREEMENT</p>
    <p>Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Servicing Agreement between Scribcor, Inc., as initial Servicer, and the Trustee. The description and summaries of the Servicing Agreement hereinafter set forth do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and reference is made to the Trust Agreement for the complete details of all terms and conditions. All statements herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Servicing Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit F to this Offering Memorandum.</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreement, the Servicer has been authorized to act as agent for the Trustee with respect to (a) monitoring the performance of the Tenant under the Lease, (b) undertaking certain collection obligations of the Trust, as landlord under the Lease, and (c) pursuing, on behalf of the Trustee, certain remedies available to the Trust, as landlord under the Lease, upon the occurrence of a default thereunder.</p>
    <p>Scribcor, Inc. has been appointed as initial Servicer under the terms of the Servicing Agreement. Founded in 1891, Scribcor is a privately-held firm focusing on management, leasing and consulting in the Midwest commercial and industrial real estate market. At Mar. 31, 1995, the Servicer managed in excess of 3.5 million square feet of commercial office space, and clients of the Servicer include Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company and IBM Corporation.</p>
    <p>Duties of Servicer</p>
    <p>Basic Services. The Servicer has been engaged to monitor on behalf of the Trustee the performance by the Tenant under the Lease, to give and receive notices required or appropriate to be given or received by the Trustee (in its capacity as landlord under the Lease) and to otherwise perform on behalf of the Trustee the obligations imposed under the Lease upon the Trustee (in its capacity as landlord under the Lease). The Servicer shall inspect the Property not less frequently than two times in each twelve calendar month period during the term of the Servicing Agreement for the purpose of determining Tenant's compliance with the terms of the Lease, and Servicer shall prepare and deliver to the Trustee a report reflecting the results of such inspection. Among other things, the Servicer shall perform certain billing services, including the rendering of monthly invoices for rent, and refer to the Trustee any communications received by the Servicer from the Tenant concerning payment disputes, any proposed transfer of the Tenant's interest in the Lease, and any communications respecting matters which constitute or, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute, an Event of Default under the Lease. The Servicer shall review the financial and legal covenants contained in the Lease as necessary to accurately monitor Tenant's performance thereunder and, in connection therewith, the Servicer has agreed to immediately notify Trustee upon obtaining knowledge that the insurance required under the Lease is not being maintained strictly in accordance with terms thereof.</p>
    <p>The Servicer shall direct the Tenant to make all payments required to be made by the Tenant under the Lease directly to the Trustee for deposit into the Certificate Distribution Account. If the Servicer shall receive any collections of rent or other payments directly, the Servicer shall cause such collections to be deposited into the Certificate Distribution Account no later than the business day following receipt thereof.</p>
    <p>The Servicer shall receive as compensation for performance of the basic monitoring services described above an annual fee in the amount of $2,500, which shall be payable annually in advance in a single installment.</p>
    <p>Additional Services. If an Event of Default shall occur under the Lease, the Servicer shall give a default notice with respect thereto to the Tenant and to the Trustee not later than two business days after the date in which the Servicer first obtains knowledge of the occurrence of such Event of Default. If so directed in writing by the Trustee, the Servicer shall initiate such actions, including the commencement of legal proceedings as shall, in the judgment of counsel retained by the Trustee for such purpose, be necessary or appropriate to preserve the Trust Estate and enforce the rights and remedies of the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease (collectively, “Enforcement Proceedings”). In connection with Enforcement Proceedings, the Servicer shall obtain an inspection of the Property, including a Phase I environmental inspection, and shall deliver copies of any report prepared in connection therewith to the Trustee promptly upon receipt. All reasonable third party costs and expenses incurred by the Servicer in pursuing such Enforcement Proceedings shall constitute Reimbursable Costs under the Servicing Agreement and the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>Upon the termination of the Lease or Tenant's right to possession of the Property under the Lease resulting from an Event of Default, Casualty Loss Termination or Total Condemnation, the Trustee may direct the Servicer to provide “Property Management Services” and to otherwise initiate such actions as are, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer, necessary and appropriate to (i) maintain the Property (including without limitation the payment of real property taxes, insurance premiums and other reasonable costs and expenses of maintaining the Property in good operating condition and in compliance with all laws); and (ii), if so directed in writing by the Trustee, procure a Replacement Lease or leases on such terms and conditions as shall be approved in writing by the Trustee. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Servicer in performing Property Management Services shall constitute Reimbursable Costs under the Servicing Agreement and the Trust Agreement. “Property Management Services” shall mean such usual and customary activities as are required to oversee and perform all aspects of the day-to-day management, oversight, operation and maintenance of the Property in a manner consistent with the servicing standard set forth in the Servicing Agreement and so as to cause the Property to be maintained in good condition and in compliance with all laws. The Trustee and the Servicer shall enter into an amendment to the Servicing Agreement setting forth the agreed upon scope of and compensation for Property Management Services at the time the same are requested by the Trustee, which amendment shall have been submitted to Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation (“S&amp;P”), and S&amp;P shall have confirmed that such amendment shall not result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of its then-assigned rating with respect to the Certificates.</p>
    <p>In the event of a Casualty Loss affecting the Property in connection with which the amount of casualty proceeds payable with respect to such Casualty Loss shall be $100,000 or more, the Servicer will give written notice thereof to the Trustee not later than three business days after the Servicer shall have obtained knowledge of such Casualty Loss. Thereafter, the Trustee shall direct the Servicer to exercise the rights and perform the obligations of the Trustee, subject to the provisions of the Servicing Agreement and the Trust Agreement, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease, in accordance with Section XIV of the Lease (or the comparable provisions of any Replacement Lease) in connection with the settlement of all insurance claims relating to such Casualty Loss in connection with the restoration of the Property by the Tenant as required pursuant to Article XIV.A. of the Lease (collectively, “Casualty Services”). See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Casualty Loss.”</p>
    <p>Upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss Termination during the last two years of the Term of the Lease and following deposit of the Net Casualty Proceeds resulting therefrom into the Casualty Account, such proceeds shall be administered by the Servicer, at the direction of the Trustee, to engage a Qualified Contractor and to restore the Property to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to the Casualty Loss Termination. Without limiting the foregoing, the Servicer shall perform on behalf of the Trustee the obligations of the Trustee upon the occurrence of a Casualty Loss resulting in a Casualty Loss Termination, all as set forth in the Trust Agreement. See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Casualty Loss.”</p>
    <p>In the event of a Total Condemnation, the Servicer shall give written notice thereof to the Trustee not later than three business days after Servicer shall have obtained actual knowledge of such Total Condemnation. Thereafter, the Servicer shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to assist the Trustee in completing the sale of the Property pursuant to Section XV of the Lease. See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Condemnation.”</p>
    <p>For performing the Property Management Services and services associated with a Casualty Loss, Total Condemnation and/or a construction management function (collectively, the “Additional Services”), the Servicer shall receive an additional servicing fee in an amount to be determined by the Trustee and the Servicer, based upon the submission by the Servicer of a proposed scope of service and budget therefor; provided, however, that the amount of any additional servicing fee shall have been submitted to S&amp;P, and S&amp;P shall have confirmed that payment of such additional servicing fee shall not result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of its then-assigned rating with respect to the Certificates. In each case, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the basic servicing fee and such additional servicing fee associated with Additional Services, all Reimbursable Costs reasonably incurred in connection with the performance of such Additional Services.</p>
    <p>Servicing Standard</p>
    <p>The Servicing Agreement provides that the Servicer shall perform its obligations thereunder with reasonable care and in a manner consistent with prudent industry standards for commercial property managers. Without limiting the foregoing, the Servicer shall provide services under the Servicing Agreement with at least the same level of care, skill, prudence and diligence used by the Servicer in connection with the servicing and administration of similar assets by the Servicer for its own account and for the accounts of others, giving due consideration to customary and usual property servicing and management practices of a prudent property and asset manager, the restrictions placed on the Servicer's activities as provided in the Servicing Agreement, and the limited scope of the Servicer's obligations under the Servicing Agreement.</p>
    <p>Other Matters</p>
    <p>In connection with the performance of its obligations under the Servicing Agreement, the Servicer shall maintain at its expense a blanket fidelity bond covering all of Servicer's officers, employees or other persons acting in any capacity, permitting such persons to handle funds, money, documents and papers related to the Property. The Servicer shall also obtain and maintain at all times prescribed insurance coverages, with respect to which the issuer, policy form and terms, coverage limits and deductibles shall be as reasonably required by the Trustee from time to time.</p>
    <p>The Servicer shall annually deliver to the Trustee an officer's certificate stating that (a) a review of the activities of the Servicer during the proceeding calendar year and of its performance under the Servicing Agreement has been made under such officer's supervision and (b), to the best of such officer's knowledge, the Servicer has fulfilled all of its obligations under the Servicing Agreement throughout such year or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, such Certificate shall specify each such default known to such officer and the nature and status thereof.</p>
    <p>The Servicing Agreement provides that the Servicer will defend and indemnify the Trust and Certificateholders against any and all costs, expenses, losses, damages claims and liabilities, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation, arising out of or resulting from the willful failure, or gross negligence of the Servicer in the performance of its duties under the Servicing Agreement. The Servicer's obligations to indemnify the Trust and the Certificateholders for the Servicer's actions or omissions will survive the removal of the Servicer, but will not apply to any action or omission of a successor Servicer.</p>
    <p>The Servicing Agreement provides that the Servicer may not resign from its obligations and duties as Servicer thereunder, except upon a determination that the Servicer's performance of such duties is no longer permissible under applicable law. No such resignation will become effective until the Trustee or a successor Servicer has assumed the Servicer's servicing obligations and duties under the Servicing Agreement.</p>
    <p>Any corporation or other entity into which the Servicer may be merged or consolidated into, or that may result from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Servicer is a party, or any entity that may succeed by purchase and assumption to all or substantially all of the business of the Servicer, or the Servicer is not the surviving entity and where such corporation or other entity assumes the obligation of the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement, who will be the successor to the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement.</p>
    <p>Events of Termination</p>
    <p>The following events will constitute “Events of Termination” under the Servicing Agreement:</p>
    <p>(i) any failure by the Servicer to remit or deposit any payment required to be made under the terms of the Servicing Agreement, which failure continues beyond the second day following the date upon which such payment was due;</p>
    <p>(ii) any failure by the Servicer duly to observe or perform in any material respect any covenant or agreement in the Servicing Agreement, which failure continues unremedied for 10 days after written notice of such failure is given to the Servicer by the Trustee or to the Servicer and the Trustee by the holders of Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the aggregate outstanding balance of the Certificates; and</p>
    <p>(iii) certain events of bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or similar proceedings and certain actions by the Servicer indicating its insolvency pursuant to bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, insolvency or similar proceedings or its inability to pay its obligations.</p>
    <p>The holders of Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the aggregate outstanding balance thereof may waive any Event of Termination.</p>
    <p>Rights Upon an Event of Termination</p>
    <p>As long as an Event of Termination remains unremedied, the Trustee may terminate the Servicer's rights and obligations under the Servicing Agreement, whereupon the Trustee will succeed to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement. Thereafter, the Trustee will be entitled to the same fee otherwise payable to the Servicer. The Trustee may appoint, or petition the court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of, an eligible Servicer to act as successor to the outgoing Servicer under the Servicing Agreement. In no event may the servicing compensation to be paid to such successor be greater than the fee payable to the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement. In the event of the bankruptcy of the Servicer, the bankruptcy trustee or the Servicer, as debtor in possession, may have the power to prevent a termination of the Servicer's rights and obligations under the Servicing Agreement. A “Eligible Servicer” means a person which, at the time of its appointment as Servicer, (i) has not less than 10 years experience as a professional asset or property manager and is licensed (if required) to perform such services in the locale of the Property; (ii) then has under management a portfolio of commercial and office properties containing in the aggregate not less than 2,000,000 square feet, or with an aggregate fair market value of not less than $20,000,000; and (iii) then has not fewer than 20 employees directly engaged in the provision of asset or property management services.</p>
    <p>THE BUILDING AND THE PROPERTY</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <p>The Grantor has purchased for $10,455,000 the entire fee simple interest in the Kansas City Life Insurance Office Building, a 94,149 square foot office building (the “Building”) located at 4900 Oak Street in the Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City, Mo. The Country Club Plaza district is located approximately 4.5 miles south of Downtown Kansas City. The Building was constructed in 1960 and substantial renovations were completed by the Subtenant for approximately $1.5 million on the Building in 1992.</p>
    <p>The Building</p>
    <p>The Building is a three-story office building containing 94,149 square feet of rentable area, of which approximately 27,780 square feet comprise a basement containing a mailroom, print shop, cafeteria, boiler room and restrooms. A sprinklered garage containing 76,341 square feet adjoins and is connected to the structure and provides sheltered parking for 250 vehicles. The Building was constructed in 1960, and substantial renovations were completed in 1992. The Building is of steel beam and column construction, with exterior walls of concrete panels, brick, decorative marble and glass. The Building's heating/ventilating/air conditioning system consists of hot and cold deck systems which utilize two gas hot water heaters, each with 37,000,000 BTUs of heating capacity, together with two 200 ton Carrier centrifugal chillers. The Grantor believes that the Building is in very good physical condition.</p>
    <p>The Property</p>
    <p>The Building and its adjoining garage are located approximately 4.5 miles south of downtown Kansas City on a 2.091 acre parcel in an area commonly referred to as the Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City, Mo.. The Property, situate at the intersection of Volker Boulevard and Oak Street, is located directly across from the campus of the University of Missouri at Kansas City and is surrounded by several other office buildings, medical research facilities and high-quality residential developments. Access to the Property site is along both Volker Boulevard and Oak Street, with a circular drive running to the Building's front entrance off of Oak Street.</p>
    <p>The Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City is anchored by the Country Club Plaza retail development, which was established in 1920's as the country's first “shopping center.” Country Club Plaza remains one of the most prestigious retail locations in Kansas City, attracting quality tenants including Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany, Brooks Brothers, Dillard's and Ralph Lauren/Polo, among others. Country Club Plaza is located less than one mile from the Property. The area surrounding the Property is fully developed, made up of approximately 45% single family residential, 15% institutional, 15% commercial retail, 15% multi-family residential and 10% commercial office buildings.</p>
    <p>The Kansas City, Missouri/Kansas metropolitan area is the 28th largest in the United States, with a population in excess of 1.5 million. The economy of the region is diversified, with the manufacturing, wholesale/retail services and government sectors each contributing in excess of 15% of the non-agricultural jobs in the region. Transportation, finance, insurance and real estate are also substantial contributors to the region's economy.</p>
    <p>INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS</p>
    <p>The purchase of Certificates involves substantial risks for investors. In addition to general investment risks and the factors described elsewhere herein, a prospective purchaser of Certificates should consider the following factors.</p>
    <p>Real Estate Investment Risks</p>
    <p>An investment in Certificates will be subject to many of the risks generally associated with the ownership of real property, including the possibility of adverse changes in national and local economic conditions; changes in rates of inflation; changes in the real estate investment climate; adverse changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics; adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; natural disasters, including earthquakes (which may result in uninsured losses) and other factors which are beyond the control of the Grantor.</p>
    <p>No Operating History</p>
    <p>The Trust is newly formed and has no operating history.</p>
    <p>Casualty Loss Risk</p>
    <p>If the Building, or any part thereof, is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term of the Lease (except during the second to last and final year of the term), Tenant is obligated to promptly repair or restore the Building to substantially the same condition it was in immediately prior to such fire or casualty, and Tenant's obligation to pay Base Rent and to perform its other obligations under the Lease will not be suspended, abated or reduced as a result thereof.</p>
    <p>In the event of (a) damage or destruction during the second to last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 75% of the replacement value of the Building) or (b) damage or destruction during the last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 25% of the replacement value of the Building), the Tenant may terminate the Lease, provided that any and all insurance proceeds in such case received by Tenant are required to be paid to and assigned to the Trust. In each such case, the Trustee, in its capacity as landlord under the Lease and pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, is obligated to utilize such insurance proceeds to restore the Building to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to such Casualty Loss Termination.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the terms of the Lease, Tenant is required to maintain all-risk property and casualty insurance for the full (100%) replacement cost of the Property (with a deductible of not more than $25,000). See “THE LEASE—Insurance.” The Trustee is required pursuant to the Trust Agreement to procure rental interruption insurance in an amount sufficient to assure that holders of Certificates will receive when due monthly Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates. There can be no assurance that receipt by the Trustee of any such casualty insurance or rental interruption insurance proceeds will be at such time or times sufficient to assure timely payment with respect to the Certificates. See “THE TRUST AGREEMENT—Specific Duties of Trustee—Rental Interruption Insurance.”</p>
    <p>Tenant Lease Payments—Bankruptcy Considerations</p>
    <p>The sole source of payment of Certificate Payments with respect to the Certificates will be the Tenant's monthly Lease Payments of Base Rent under the Lease. The Trust, as landlord under the Lease, will be entitled to receive directly all payments made by the Tenant pursuant to the Lease.</p>
    <p>If the Tenant and Kansas City Life are unable to make their respective payments required under the Lease and Guaranty, respectively, there can be no assurance that the Trust will be able to obtain a substitute tenant or tenants willing to make rental payments sufficient to generate Lease Payments with respect to the Certificates, and to otherwise pay operating expenses and tax payments associated with the Building. It is not possible to predict the future demand for, or rents associated with, office space in the Building's market.</p>
    <p>In a bankruptcy proceeding involving the Tenant, the Tenant would have the option to assume or reject the Lease. If the Tenant elects to assume its obligations under the Lease, it could do so only upon approval of the bankruptcy court following a hearing at which the financial burdens and business purpose of the assumption were presented, and at which the Tenant's other creditors were given an opportunity to participate. If the bankruptcy court allowed the Tenant to reject the Lease, the Trust would be entitled to file a claim for its actual rejection damages or a formula amount, whichever is less. Under the formula, rejection damages are allowed in an amount equal to the greater of (a) one year's rent or (b) 15% of the total rent remaining due under the Lease, up to a maximum of three years' rent. The rejection damages claim, plus any unpaid pre-bankruptcy rent, would be treated as a pre-bankruptcy general unsecured claim against the Tenant. It is not possible to predict what action a bankruptcy court might take with respect to the Lease, although typically a bankruptcy court defers to the judgment of the debtor (the Tenant) or bankruptcy trustee, as the case may be. In any bankruptcy of the Tenant, it is possible that there may not be sufficient assets to pay in full pre-bankruptcy unsecured claims, including the claim of the Trust. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the damages actually recovered in a bankruptcy case would be sufficient to pay the full amount of Lease Payments with respect to the Certificates.</p>
    <p>If Kansas City Life were also a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or failed to make payments of rent or other obligations when due, the Trust would be entitled under certain circumstances to file a claim under the Guaranty for the Lease Payments due with respect to the Certificates. Kansas City Life's obligations under the Guaranty are intended to be contractually independent of the Tenant's obligations under the Lease so that a claim against Kansas City Life under the Guaranty might not be subject to the same limitation on rejection damages described above as might be applicable to the Trust's claim against the Tenant under the Lease. However, it is not free from doubt that the independence of such obligation from the Tenant's obligations under the Lease would be preserved by a bankruptcy court in a proceeding involving Kansas City Life as the debtor, and such obligations may be subject to the rejection formula described above in bankruptcy proceedings involving the Tenant. If the Tenant rejected the Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, its obligations to pay rent would be terminated (subject to the receipt by the Trust of any rejection damages).</p>
    <p>If the Tenant were a debtor in a bankruptcy case and Kansas City Life were not, the Trust, to the extent permitted by law, would be entitled, in certain circumstances provided for in the Guaranty, to pursue an action against Kansas City Life for payments due under the Lease. Kansas City Life's obligations under the Guaranty are contractually independent of the Tenant's obligations under the Lease and an action against Kansas City Life under the Guaranty should not be subject to the same limitation on rejection damages as might be applicable to the Trust's claim against the Tenant under the Lease. If the Tenant rejected the Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, its obligations to pay rent would be terminated (subject to receipt of any rejection damages as described above).</p>
    <p>Lack of Liquidity</p>
    <p>There is no established market for the Certificates and the Grantor does not anticipate that any such market will develop. Consequently, holders may not be able to liquidate their investment in the event of an emergency or for other reasons. Purchase of a Certificate is therefore suitable only for persons who have no need for liquidity with respect to their investment and who are able to bear the economic risks of their investment for an unlimited period of time.</p>
    <p>Securities Law Aspects</p>
    <p>The Certificates have not been registered under the Act or the Illinois Securities Act in reliance upon certain exemptions from registration thereunder. The Grantor believes that the offering presently qualifies and, where appropriate, will continue to qualify under the exemptions. However, since the availability of certain of these exemptions is based upon subjective factors, and in some instances the criteria for exemption are subject to reinterpretation by state or federal regulatory agencies and courts, there can be no assurance that such exemptions will be determined to be available.</p>
    <p>ERISA Considerations</p>
    <p>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) generally prohibit certain transactions between a qualified employee benefit plan under ERISA (an “ERISA Plan”) and persons who, with respect to that plan, are fiduciaries or other “parties in interest” within the meaning of ERISA or a “disqualified person” within the meaning of the Code. In the absence of an applicable administrative exemption, transactions between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest with respect to an ERISA Plan, including the acquisition by one from the other of a Certificate, could be viewed as violating those prohibitions. In this regard, the Tenant or Kansas City Life might be considered or might become a “party in interest” within the meaning of ERISA or a “disqualified person” within the meaning of the Code, with respect to an ERISA Plan. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of ERISA and the Code may arise if Certificates are acquired by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Tenant or Kansas City Life is a party in interest or a disqualified person. In all events, fiduciaries of ERISA Plans, in consultation with their advisors, should carefully consider the impact of ERISA and the Code on an investment in Certificates.</p>
    <heading>FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS</heading> <p>PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR PERSONAL TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING CERTIFICATES.</p>
    <p>The following is a summary of the material federal income tax consequences to holders of Certificates. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and upon rules and regulations promulgated under the Code and existing interpretations thereof, any of which could be changed at any time, by legislation or otherwise. Any of such changes may or may not be retroactive with respect to transactions consummated prior to the date such changes are announced. The discussion below does not purport to address federal income tax consequences applicable to particular categories of investors, some of which (e.g., banks, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies or foreign investors) may be subject to special rules. No rulings will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any of the matters discussed herein.</p>
    <p>In the opinion of Kirkland &amp; Ellis, special tax counsel to the Grantor, the Term Trust will be classified for Federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Accordingly, each holder of a Certificate will be subject to federal income taxation as if it owned directly its proportionate interest in each asset owned by the Trust. Each holder of Certificates will be required to report on its federal income tax return its pro rata share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit from the Property held in the Trust, in accordance with such holder's method of accounting.</p>
    <p>Subject to the restriction set forth in the succeeding paragraph, in the opinion of Kirkland &amp; Ellis, each holder of a Certificate will be entitled to amortize its tax basis in the Certificate. Section 167(a) of the Code provides a depreciation deduction for business or income-producing property which obsolesces or “wastes away” over a reasonably determinable time period. The Term Interest held by the Trust is a term-of-years interest in real property which produces income under the Lease, the value of which decreases commensurately with the passage of time. Therefore, as a general matter, the Term Interest constitutes a depreciable asset and each holder of a Certificate is entitled to claim a deduction, for each taxable year during which it holds such Certificate, in an amount equal to (1) its adjusted tax basis in such Certificate, divided by (2) the number of years, including the current year, remaining in the term of the Term Interest. (This amount may have to be prorated if a holder holds a Certificate during less than all of a taxable year.) Under Section 167(c) of the Code, none of a Certificate holder's adjusted tax basis is allocable to, and no separate depreciation deduction is allowable for, the Trust's interest in the Lease.</p>
    <p>However, Section 167(e) of the Code prohibits the taking of a depreciation deduction (under Section 167 or any other income tax provision of the Code) with respect to a term interest in property for any period during which the remainder interest in such property is held (directly or indirectly) by a related person. For this purpose, “related person” is defined very broadly by reference to Code Sections 267(b) and (e) and includes family members, corporations, partnerships and/or trusts having 50% or more cross-ownership or common ownership, among other relationships. Moreover, these related person rules are expanded as applied to “pass-thru entities,” including Subchapter S corporations and partnerships (and limited liability companies structured to be taxable as partnerships under the Code). Under these expanded rules, as applied for purposes of Section 167(e), if, for example, a partnership owned the Term Interest, no depreciation deduction would be allowable if any of its partners, or any family member of any of its partners, or any corporation in the same controlled group as any of its partners, etc., owned (directly or indirectly) the Remainder interest (or any other remainder interest) in the Property. For purposes of rendering its opinion, Kirkland &amp; Ellis has assumed that no holder of a Certificate or “related person” owns or will own (directly or indirectly) the LURE® interest or any other remainder interest in the Property.</p>
    <p>A holder that sells or exchanges a Certificate should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between its adjusted tax basis in the Certificate and the amount realized upon such sale or exchange. If the holder held such Certificate as a capital asset, any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Certificate was held for more than one year. Any long-term capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of a Certificate will be taxable under current law to corporate taxpayers at the rates applicable to ordinary income, and to individual taxpayers at a maximum marginal rate of 28%. Any capital losses realized generally will be deductible by a corporate taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains and by an individual taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains plus $3,000 of other income.</p>
    <p>PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p>Pursuant to a placement agreement (the “Placement Agreement”) between the Grantor and William Blair &amp; Company (the “Placement Agent”), the Placement Agent has agreed to use its best efforts to solicit the purchase of the Certificates. The Grantor has agreed to pay the Placement Agent a fee as compensation for its services in connection with the issuance and sale of the Certificates.</p>
    <p>The Grantor has agreed to indemnify the Placement Agent against certain civil liabilities, including certain liabilities arising out of any incorrect statements or information or omissions in or for this Offering Memorandum, and to contribute with respect to payments that the Placement Agent may be required to make in respect thereof.</p>
    <p>RATING</p>
    <p>Standard &amp; Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (“S&amp;P”), has assigned the Certificates a rating of “A+”. No application was made to any other rating agency for the purpose of obtaining an additional rating of the Certificates. A rating reflects only the views of S&amp;P, and an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from S&amp;P. The Grantor has furnished to S&amp;P information and materials in order to secure a rating for the Certificates, including certain information and materials which have not been included in the Official Memorandum. Once assigned, there is no assurance that any rating will continue for any given period of time, or that it will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the issuing rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or withdrawal of a rating assigned to the Certificates may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Certificates.</p>
    <p>A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.</p>
    <p>Kansas City Life is the guarantor of the Tenant's obligations under the Lease and, as such, may become the ultimate source of payment on the Certificates. Because of this dependence upon Kansas City Life for the ultimate payment of the Certificates, the rating on the Certificates is directly related to the credit of Kansas City Life. It should, therefore, be expected that a reduction, withdrawal or qualification of the debt ratings of Kansas City Life would adversely affect the rating on the Certificates.</p>
    <p>REPORTS TO CERTIFICATEHOLDERS</p>
    <p>The Trustee will furnish to each holder of Certificates certain reports, statements and tax information, as set forth in the Trust Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit D, including such information necessary in the preparation of the Certificateholders' federal income tax returns.</p>
    <p>ADDITIONAL INQUIRIES</p>
    <p>The Grantor will make every effort to furnish to any qualified prospective investor any additional information, or opportunity for inquiry, concerning the terms and conditions of this offering, including information requested to verify the accuracy of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum or otherwise furnished the prospective investor.</p>
    <p>LEGAL MATTERS</p>
    <p>The legality of the Certificates offered hereby will be passed upon for the Grantor by Gardner, Carton &amp; Douglas, Chicago, Illinois. Gardner, Carton &amp; Douglas has served as special securities counsel to the Grantor and certain affiliates of the Grantor. Certain tax matters relating to the Trust, the Certificates and the Term Interest will be passed upon for the Grantor by Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
    <p>ENFORCEABILITY OF REMEDIES</p>
    <p>The remedies available to the Trustee or the owners of the Certificates upon an event of default under the Lease or the Trust Agreement are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions that are often subject to discretion and delay. Under existing constitutional and statutory law and judicial decisions, including specifically Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), the remedies specified by the Lease or the Trust Agreement may not be readily available or may be limited. The various legal opinions to be delivered concurrently with the delivery of the Certificates will be qualified as to the enforceability of the various legal instruments by limitations imposed by principles of equity and by bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Similarly, the remedies available to the Trustee under the Lease may be subject to common law principles and statutory provisions affecting the rights of landlords and tenants.</p>
    <p>NOTICE TO INVESTORS</p>
    <p>Because of the following restrictions, purchasers are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of Certificates.</p>
    <p>The Certificates have not been registered under the Securities Act or with any securities regulatory authority of any jurisdiction and, accordingly, may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Certificates are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”), as defined in Rule 144A, in compliance with Rule 144A.</p>
    <p>Each purchaser of Certificates offered hereby, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Grantor as follows:</p>
    <p>1. It understands and acknowledges that the Certificates have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act, or any other securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in a transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (4) below.</p>
    <p>2. It is a “qualified institutional buyer” (“QIB”), as defined in Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act, and it is aware that any sale of the Certificates to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A. Such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB.</p>
    <p>3. It will deliver to each person to whom it transfers Certificates notice of any restrictions on transfer of such Certificates.</p>
    <p>4. It is purchasing the Certificates for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act, subject to any requirements of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control. It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Certificates and each subsequent holder of the Certificates by its acceptance thereof will agree to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Certificates only (a) to the Grantor, (b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as the Certificates are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act, or (e) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, and in each of the foregoing cases, in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. Each purchaser acknowledges that each Certificate will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:</p>
    <p>THIS CERTIFICATE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. NEITHER THIS CERTIFICATE NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE REOFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, REGISTRATION.</p>
    <p>THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF AGREES (A) TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH CERTIFICATE ONLY (1) TO THE GRANTOR, (2) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (3) FOR SO LONG AS THIS CERTIFICATE IS ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A, (4) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR (5) PURSUANT TO THE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, IF AVAILABLE, AND IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND (B) IT WILL NOTIFY ANY PURCHASER OF THIS CERTIFICATE OR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN FROM IT OF THE RESALE RESTRICTION REFERRED TO ABOVE.</p>
    <p>5. It acknowledges that the Grantor and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements and agrees that, if any of the acknowledgments, representations and warranties deemed to have been made by it by its purchase of Certificates are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Grantor and the Placement Agent.

    <p>(a) If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Term Trustee, or The Term Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) there is delivered to the Term Trustee and the Trust such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Term Trustee that such Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Term Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust and the Term Trustee shall authenticate and deliver (or shall cause its authenticating agent to authenticate and deliver), in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a replacement Certificate of a like aggregate principal amount; provided, however, that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, but not a mutilated Certificate, shall have become or within seven days shall be due and payable, then instead of issuing a replacement Certificate the Term Trustee may pay such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate when so due or payable.</p>

    <p>(c) In connection with the issuance of any replacement Certificate under this Section 3.5, the Term Trustee may require the payment by the Certificateholder of such Certificate of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Term Trustee and the Certificate Registrar) connected therewith.</p>

Consequently, the Certificates are not transferable other than pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and satisfaction of certain other provisions specified herein. No sale, pledge or other transfer of the Certificates may be made by any person unless either (i) such sale, pledge or other transfer is made to a “qualified institutional buyer” that executes a certificate, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B or as otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the Term Trustee and the Seller, to the effect that (A) it is “qualified institutional buyer” as defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act, acting for its own account or the accounts of other “qualified institutional buyers” as defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) it is aware that the transferor of such Certificate intends to rely on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act, or (ii) such sale, pledge or other transfer is otherwise made in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in which case (A) the Term Trustee shall require that both the prospective transferor and the prospective transferee certify to the Term Trustee and the Seller in writing the facts surrounding such transfer, which certification shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee and the Seller, and (B) the Term Trustee shall require a written opinion of counsel (which will not be at the expense of the Seller or the Term Trustee) satisfactory to the Seller and the Term Trustee to the effect that such transfer will not violate the Securities Act.</p>
    <p>(b) The Certificates may not be acquired by or for the account of (i) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) that is subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA (ii) a plan described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (iii) any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” as defined in ERISA by reason of a plan's investment in the entity (each, a “Benefit Plan”). By accepting and holding a Certificate, the Certificateholder shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not a Benefit Plan and, if requested to do so by the Seller or the Trustee, the Certificateholder shall execute and deliver to the Trustee an Undertaking Letter in the form set forth in Exhibit C.</p>

Except for the Certificates issued to the Seller, the Certificates, upon original issuance, may be issued in the form of a typewritten certificate or certificates representing Book-Entry Certificates, to be delivered to the Clearing Agency by or on behalf of the Trust pursuant to the terms of the Certificate Depository Agreement.

    <p>(e) whenever this Agreement requires or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or directions of Certificateholders owning a specified percentage of the Voting Interests, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to represent such percentage only to the extent that it has received instructions to such effect from the beneficial owner(s) of the Certificate(s) and/or Clearing Agency Participants owning or representing, respectively, such required percentage of Voting Interests and has delivered such instructions to the Term Trustee.</p>
    <p>SECTION 3.12 Notices to Clearing Agency.

If (i) the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the Certificates, and the Term Trustee is unable to locate a qualified successor, (ii) the Term Trustee elects by notice in writing to the Certificateholders to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency, or (iii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Certificateholders owning a majority of the Voting Interests advise the Clearing Agency in writing that the continuation of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interest of the Certificateholders, then the Clearing Agency shall notify all Certificateholders and the Term Trustee of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive Certificates to Certificateholders requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Term Trustee of the typewritten Certificate or Certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Term Trustee shall execute and authenticate the Definitive Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. The Term Trustee shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates, the Term Trustee shall recognize the party(ies) to whom such Definitive Certificate(s) is (are) issued as Certificateholders.</p>

In making such investments, the Term Trustee shall take into consideration the timing and amount of Distributions and any other payments required or permitted to be made pursuant to this Agreement so as to maintain sufficient liquidity of such funds to permit the Term Trustee to meet the anticipated cash expenditure obligations of the Trust from time to time. Interest or other earnings from such Eligible Investments shall be credited to the Certificate Distribution Account as earned from time to time.</p>

    <p>(b) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Term Trustee may conclusively rely upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Term Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement in determining the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions contained therein; provided, however, that the Term Trustee shall have examined such certificates or opinions so as to determine compliance of the same with the requirements of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>(c) The Term Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:</p>

    <p>(a) The Term Trustee shall at all times prior to the termination of the Trust pursuant to Article VII hereof, take all actions necessary to preserve the existence of the Trust, including, without limitation, the preparation and filing of all instruments or documentation required in connection therewith. In no event shall the Term Trustee take any action, or consent to the taking of any action, pursuant to which the Term Trustee, the Certificateholders or any other person or party seeks to combine, partition, join or merge the Trust Estate with or into any other interest in the Real Property, it being acknowledged by the Certificateholders, through their acquisition of the Certificates, that no Certificateholder shall have any right, claim or cause of action, whether at law or in equity, against the Term Trustee or any other Person, pursuant to which such Certificateholder may seek to have the Trust Estate combined with any other interest in the Real Property, any such right having been hereby fully and irrevocably waived.</p>

    <p>(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.2(e), if the Lease, or the Tenant's right to possession of the Real Property thereunder, is terminated at any time during the last ten (10) years of the Term, the provisions of Section 6.2(e) with respect to the maintenance and repair of the Real Property shall not apply unless and until at least one (1) Replacement Tenant has executed a lease for and taken possession of the Real Property or any portion thereof; provided, however, that such maintenance provisions shall be likewise suspended at any time thereafter at which there shall not be at least one performing Tenant in possession of all or some portion of the Real Property.</p>
    <p>(i) If there shall occur a Casualty Loss Termination, the Net Casualty Proceeds shall be deposited into the Casualty Account and applied by the Term Trustee or, at its direction, the Servicer, to restore the Real Property to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss giving rise to the Casualty Loss Termination. In such event, the Term Trustee shall direct the Servicer to obtain on behalf of the Trust, within forty-five (45) days after the Casualty Loss in question, or such later time as may be reasonable or necessary under the circumstances, at least three (3) fixed-price bids for the performance of the work required in connection with such restoration from experienced general contractors each having (i) net worth of not less than $10,000,000.00; (ii) a five (5) year annual average contract volume of not less than $50,000,000.00; and (iii) not less than ten (10) years of continuous business operation. The Term Trustee shall submit all three (3) bids to the Certificateholders, who shall direct in writing the Term Trustee as to the bid to be selected not later than thirty (30) days after receipt by the Certificateholders of such bids. If the Certificateholders shall fail or refuse to select one of the three (3) bids within said thirty (30) day period, then the Term Trustee shall direct the Servicer to make a written recommendation as to the bid which, in the judgement of the Servicer exercised in accordance with the servicing standards set forth in the Servicing Agreement, is in the best interest of the Certificateholders, and the Term Trustee shall select such bid and direct the Servicer to proceed with the restoration. In such event, the Term Trustee shall direct the Servicer to provide usual and customary construction management services in connection with the supervision and management of such restoration pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreement. All fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Term Trustee in acting pursuant to this Section 6.2(i) shall be Reimbursable Costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Term Trustee shall not be required to take any action, incur any expenses or advance any funds of the Term Trustee under this Section 6.2(i) unless: (1) there shall then be on deposit in the Casualty Account funds sufficient, in the sole judgment of the Term Trustee, to provide for reimbursement of all Reimbursable Costs incurred or to be incurred by the Term Trustee in acting pursuant to this Section 6.2(i); or (2) the Term Trustee shall have received assurances from the Certificateholders (or otherwise) as to the source and manner for the reimbursement of such Reimbursable Costs satisfactory to the Term Trustee. If the Term Trustee shall seek such assurances from the Certificateholders and the Certificateholders shall fail or refuse to provide such assurances within fifteen (15) days after receipt of demand therefor, such failure or refusal shall constitute a Termination Event and excuse further performance by the Term Trustee pursuant to the provisions of this Section. If, upon completion of the restoration of the Real Property required by this Section 6.2(i) there shall remain any unapplied balance of Net Casualty Proceeds, the same shall be distributed to the Certificateholders in accordance with Section 5.2 hereof.</p>

Subparagraph E of the Lease.

If the Certificateholders shall not have joined in such appointment within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a request so to do, the Term Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee pursuant to Section 6.14 and no notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required pursuant to Section 6.11.</p>
    <p>(b) Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:</p>
    <p>(i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Term Trustee shall be conferred upon and exercised or performed by the Term Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Term Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed, the Term Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust Estate or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the Term Trustee;</p>
    <p>(ii) no trustee under this Agreement shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee under this Agreement; and</p>
    <p>(iii) the Certificateholders and the Term Trustee acting jointly may at any time accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.</p>
    <p>(c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Term Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Term Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Term Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the Term Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Certificateholders.</p>
    <p>(d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the Term Trustee as its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Term Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor trustee.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.14 Eligibility Requirements for Term Trustee. Subject to Section 6.13, the Term Trustee shall at all times be The First National Bank of Chicago, or in the case of a successor Term Trustee: (i) be a bank or other depository institution authorized pursuant to applicable laws to exercise corporate trust powers with respect to the Trust Estate; (ii) have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and be subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities; and (iii) have (or have a parent which has) a long-term unsecured debt rating of at least BBB+ by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation. If such corporation shall publish reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purpose of this Section 6.14, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Term Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.14, the Term Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 6.11.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.15 Replacement of Servicer. If an “Event of Termination” shall occur under the Servicing Agreement, the Term Trustee shall immediately notify the Certificateholders thereof. Certificateholders having not less than a majority of the Voting Interests shall be entitled to waive such Event of Termination upon written direction to the Term Trustee. In the absence of such written direction, the Term Trustee or Certificateholders having not less than a majority of the Voting Interests may terminate the Servicing Agreement. In such event, the Term Trustee shall succeed to the rights and responsibilities of the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement. Thereafter, the Term Trustee shall be entitled to the fees payable to the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement. The Term Trustee may appoint an Eligible Servicer to act as a successor Servicer in place of the terminated Servicer under the Servicing Agreement provided that in no event shall the fees payable to such successor Servicer exceed those payable to the Servicer under the Servicing Agreement unless approved in writing by Certificateholders having not less than a majority of the Voting Interests.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE VII</heading> <heading>TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT</heading> <p> </p>
    <p>SECTION 7.1 Termination of Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>(a) This Agreement (other than Section 6.10) and the Trust shall terminate and be of no further force or effect on the final distribution by the Term Trustee of all monies or other property or proceeds of the Trust Estate in accordance with the terms hereof following the occurrence of a Termination Event, or at the time provided in Section 7.2. The bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, death or incapacity of any Certificateholder, shall not (x) operate to terminate this Agreement or the Trust, nor (y) entitle such Certificateholder's legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of all or any part of the Trust or the Trust Estate nor (z) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto.</p>
    <p>(b) Neither the Seller nor any Certificateholder shall be entitled to revoke or terminate the Trust.</p>
    <p>(c) Notice of any termination of the Trust, specifying the Distribution Date upon which the Certificateholders shall surrender their Certificates to the Term Trustee for final distribution and cancellation,(the “Final Distribution Date”), shall be given by the Term Trustee by letter to Certificateholders mailed within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of a Termination Event (a “Termination Notice”), stating: (i) the Final Distribution Date at which time final payment of the Certificates shall be made upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office of the Term Trustee therein designated; (ii) the amount (if then known) of any such final payment; and (iii) that payments will be made only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office of the Term Trustee therein specified. Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Term Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Certificateholders amounts distributable on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 5.3. The Final Distribution Date shall be not later than: (i) in the event of a Total Condemnation, thirty (30) days following receipt by the Term Trustee of the Net Compensation payable in connection therewith; (ii) in the case of a sale of the Trust Estate pursuant to Section 7.2, thirty (30) days following receipt by the Term Trustee of the proceeds from such sale; and (iii) the event of the occurrence of the Termination Date, not later than thirty (30) days following the Termination Date. If, on the Final Distribution Date, any restoration or repair of the Real Property undertaken pursuant to Sections 6.2(f) or (i) shall not have been completed, then the Term Trustee shall cause the entire balance of funds, if any, then contained in the Casualty Account to be paid to the Remainder Trustee. If, on the Final Distribution Date, any payments required to be made to the Tenant pursuant to Section 6.2(k) on account of a Partial Condemnation shall not have been made, the Term Trustee shall cause the entire balance of funds, if any, then contained in the Condemnation Account to be paid to the Remainder Trustee.</p>
    <p>d) If all of the Certificateholders shall not surrender their Certificates for cancellation within six months after the date specified in the Termination Notice, the Term Trustee shall give a second written notice to the remaining Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within one year after the second notice all the Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Term Trustee may take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact the remaining Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds and other assets that shall remain subject to this Agreement. Subject to applicable laws with respect to escheat of funds, any funds remaining in the Trust after exhaustion of such remedies in the preceding sentence shall be deemed property of the Seller and distributed by the Term Trustee to the Seller, and the Term Trustee shall have no further liability to the Certificateholders with respect thereto.</p>
    <p>SECTION 7.2 Termination Pursuant to Section 6.2. If a Termination Event shall occur pursuant to Section 6.2, the Term Trustee shall give a Termination Notice with respect thereto to the Certificateholders and to the parties to whom such notice is required pursuant to the Administration Agreement and the Term Trustee shall thereafter sell the assets of the Trust Estate at an open outcry auction held in a commercially reasonable manner and on commercially reasonable terms on a date not earlier than thirty (30) days and not later than ninety (90) days after such Termination Notice has been given by the Term Trustee all as more particularly set forth herein. Such Termination Notice shall specify the time, place and terms of such auction. The Term Trustee shall consult with the Servicer regarding the Auctioneer to be engaged by the Term Trustee and the terms and conditions of the auction to be conducted thereby. The Servicer shall make a written recommendation to the Term Trustee regarding the identity of the Auctioneer to be selected and the terms on which the auction shall be conducted; provided, however, that in all events, the Auctioneer shall conduct any auction held pursuant hereto: (i) at the Corporate Trust Office; (ii) on an open outcry basis with no reserve price or minimum bid; (iii) only after publication of the time and place for such auction in a manner and with such publications as shall then be required to satisfy the requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code, or any successor legislation, as then in effect in the jurisdiction in which such auction shall be held, with respect to sales of collateral thereunder; (iv) pursuant to bidding rules that shall specify the form of purchase and sale agreement to be entered into between the Term Trustee and the successful bidder at the auction, which agreement shall be in the form recommended by the Servicer and counsel engaged by the Trustee in connection with such auction; and (v) substantially in accordance with the rules and procedures recommended by the Servicer and counsel engaged by the Trustee in connection with such auction. The Term Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such recommendations for all purposes of this Agreement. Certificateholders and any Person controlling or controlled by, owning, owned by or under common ownership with any Certificateholder, shall not be entitled to participate in such auction. The proceeds of any such sale, disposition or liquidation of the assets of the Trust shall be applied first to any outstanding Reimbursable Costs, second to any outstanding fees due to the Term Trustee in connection with this Agreement and the balance shall constitute Collections and shall be deposited into the Certificate Distribution Account for distribution in accordance with the terms hereof.</p>
    <p>SECTION 7.3 Distribution of Remainder Proceeds. If there shall occur a Total Condemnation, the Term Trustee shall, in connection with the winding-up of the Trust, distribute the Net Compensation as follows: (i) first, to the Certificateholders, the applicable Prepayment Amount as determined pursuant to Appendix B (or the amount of the Net Compensation if the Net Compensation is less than the applicable Prepayment Amount); and (ii) second, to the Remainder Trustee, the Remainder Proceeds.</p>
    <p>SECTION 7.4 Failure of Auction. If, for any cause beyond the reasonable control of the Term Trustee, the Qualified Real Estate Consultant or the Auctioneer, the auction required pursuant to Section 7.2 hereof shall fail to produce any bidders, then the Term Trustee shall, within thirty (30) days after the date on which such auction is held, cause to be transferred to the Remainder Trustee all of the right, title and interest of the Term Trustee in and to the Trust Estate by such bills of sale, assignments, deeds or other instruments of conveyance as shall be reasonably necessary therefor, all without warranties or covenants of any nature whatsoever, without payment of any additional consideration of any nature whatsoever.</p>
    <p>SECTION 7.5 Default by Purchaser. If the purchaser of the Trust Estate at any auction held pursuant to Section 7.2 shall default in the performance of its obligations under the purchase and sale agreement entered into in connection therewith in the manner and time required thereby, and such default shall give rise to a right to terminate such purchase and sale agreement on the part of the Term Trustee, the Term Trustee is hereby irrevocably authorized and directed to terminate such agreement in accordance with its terms and to conduct another auction of the Trust Estate in the manner set forth in Section 7.2. If the purchaser at any such subsequent auction shall likewise fail to perform its obligations to purchase the Trust Estate and such failure shall give rise to a right to terminate the purchase and sale agreement entered into in connection therewith, then the Term Trustee shall terminate such agreement in accordance with its terms and proceed in the manner set forth in Section 7.4.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE VIII</heading> <heading>AMENDMENTS</heading> <p>SECTION 8.1 Amendments.</p>
    <p>This Agreement may be amended by the Term Trustee with the consent of the holders of 51% or more of the Voting Interests, to (i) cure any ambiguity, (ii) correct or supplement any provision in this Agreement that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision in this Agreement, and (iii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Trust Estate and add to or change any provisions as shall be necessary to facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee pursuant to Article VI. Any such amendment shall be narrowly construed so as to give maximum effect to each and every other provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Appendix B may be amended only with the written consent of the holders of 100% of the Voting Interests. Except as expressly otherwise provided herein, this Trust Agreement may not be amended.</p>
    <p>SECTION 8.2 Form of Amendments.</p>
    <p>(a) Promptly after the execution of any amendment, supplement or consent pursuant to Section 8.1, the Term Trustee shall furnish written notification of the substance of such amendment or consent to each Certificateholder.</p>
    <p>(b) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders, pursuant to Section 8.2, to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents (and any other consents of Certificateholders provided for in this Agreement) and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders shall be subject to such reasonable requirements as the Term Trustee may prescribe.</p>
    <p>(c) Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement or the Certificate of Trust, the Term Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely upon an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement. The Term Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which affects the Term Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement or otherwise.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE IX</heading> <heading>MISCELLANEOUS</heading> <p>SECTION 9.1 No Legal Title to Trust Estate. The Certificateholders shall not have legal title to any part of the Trust Estate. The Certificateholders shall be entitled to receive distributions with respect to their undivided ownership interest therein only in accordance with Articles V and VII hereof. No transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, of any right, title, and interest of the Certificateholders to and in their ownership interest in the Trust Estate shall operate to terminate this Agreement or the trusts hereunder or entitle any transferee to an accounting or to the transfer to it of legal title to any part of the Trust Estate.</p>
    <p>SECTION 9.2 Limitations on Rights of Others. Except for Section 2.7 and Section 9.1 hereof, and except as expressly provided in the Administration Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Term Trustee, the Seller and the Certificateholders and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to give to any other Person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim in the Trust Estate or under or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants, conditions or provisions contained herein.</p>
    <p>SECTION 9.3 Derivative Actions. Any provision contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the right, if any, of any Certificateholder to bring a derivative action in the right of the Trust is hereby made expressly subject to the following limitations and requirements:</p>
    <p>(a) such Certificateholder must meet all requirements set forth in applicable law; and</p>
    <p>(b) no Certificateholder may bring a derivative action in the right of the Trust without the prior written consent of Certificateholders owning, in the aggregate, a beneficial interest in Certificates representing 50% of the Certificate Balance.</p>
    <p>SECTION 9.4 Notices.</p>
    <p>(a) All demands, notices and communications upon or to the Seller, the Term Trustee or the Certificateholders under this Agreement shall be in writing, personally delivered, sent by electronic facsimile (with hard copy to follow via first class mail) or mailed by certified mail-return receipt requested, and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt:</p>

    <p>(This Certificate does not represent an interest in or obligation of Scribcor, Inc., Old American Insurance Company or any of their respective affiliates.)</p>
    <p>THIS CERTIFIES THAT _is the registered owner of a nonassessable, fully-paid, fractional undivided interest in K. C. ABBE® TRUST 1995-1 (the “Trust”) formed by Scribcor, Inc., an Illinois corporation.</p>
    <p>The Trust was created pursuant to a Trust Agreement, dated as of <sub>—</sub>, 1995 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the “Trust Agreement”), between the Seller and The First National Bank of Chicago, a national banking association, not in its personal capacity, but solely as trustee (the “Term Trustee”), a summary of certain of the pertinent provisions of which is set forth below. To the extent not otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>This Certificate is one of the duly authorized Certificates designated as K. C. ABBE® TRUST 1995-1 Certificate of Beneficial Interest (the “Certificates”). This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Trust Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof, to which Trust Agreement the holder of this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such holder is bound. Without limiting the foregoing, the Certificate is subject to each and every of the conditions and limitations contained in Sections 4.4 and 6.2 of the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>Under the Trust Agreement, there shall be distributed on the 15th day of each month, or, if such 15th day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day, commencing <sub>—</sub>15, 1995 (each, a “Distribution Date”), to the person in whose name this Certificate is registered on the related Record Date (as defined below), such Certificateholder's fractional undivided interest in the amount of Distributable Funds to be distributed to Certificateholders on such Distribution Date; provided however, Certificateholders shall not receive payments in respect of the Certificate Balance until all Reimbursable Costs reasonably incurred by the Term Trustee have been reimbursed to the Term Trustee in accordance with Section 6.10 and Article V of the Trust Agreement. The “Record Date,” with respect to any Distribution Date, means the close of business on the third (3rd) business day immediately preceding such Distribution Date.</p>
    <p>The distributions in respect of the Certificate Balance on this Certificate are payable in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.</p>
    <p>It is the intent of the Seller and the Certificateholders that, for purposes of federal income, state and local income and franchise taxes, and any other taxes imposed upon, measured by or based upon gross or net income, the Trust shall be treated as a grantor trust. Except as otherwise required by appropriate taxing authorities, the Seller and the other Certificateholders by acceptance of a Certificate, agree to treat, and to take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, the Certificates for such tax purposes as interests in such grantor trust.</p>
    <p>Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Certificate, covenants and agrees that such Certificateholder shall not, prior to the date which is one year and one day after the termination of the Trust Agreement, acquiesce in, petition or otherwise invoke or cause the Seller to invoke the process of any court or governmental authority for the purpose of commencing or sustaining a case against the Seller under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar law or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the Seller or any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Seller.</p>
    <p>Distributions on this Certificate shall be made as provided in the Trust Agreement by the Term Trustee by wire transfer or check mailed to the Certificateholder of record in the Certificate Register without the presentation or surrender of this Certificate or the making of any notation hereon. Except as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement and notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate shall be made after due notice by the Term Trustee of the pendency of such distribution and only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office maintained for such purpose by the Trustee in the City of Chicago, County of Cook and State of Illinois.</p>
    <p>Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.</p>
    <p>Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed by an authorized officer of the Term Trustee by manual signature, this Certificate shall not entitle the holder hereof to any benefit under the Trust Agreement or be valid for any purpose.</p>
    <p>THIS CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.</p>
    <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Term Trustee, on behalf of the Trust and not in its individual capacity, has caused this Certificate to be duly executed.</p>

    <heading>REVERSE OF CERTIFICATE</heading> <p>The Certificates do not represent an obligation of, or an interest in, the Seller, Tenant, any Replacement Tenant, the Term Trustee or any affiliates of any of them and no recourse may be had against such parties or their assets, except as may be expressly set forth or contemplated herein or in the Trust Agreement. In addition, this Certificate is not guaranteed by any governmental agency or instrumentality and is limited in right of payment to certain collections and recoveries with respect to the Trust Estate (and certain other amounts), all as more specifically set forth herein and in the Trust Agreement. A copy of the Trust Agreement may be examined during normal business hours at the principal office of the Seller or the Term Trustee, and at such other places, if any, designated by the Seller, or the Term Trustee, by any Certificateholder upon written request.</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement does not permit, with certain exceptions therein provided, the amendment thereof or the modification of the rights and obligations of the Seller and the rights of the Certificateholders under the Trust Agreement. To the extent such amendments and modifications are permitted, the same may be made only with the consent of Certificateholders whose Certificates evidence not less than a majority of the Voting Interests as of the close of business on the immediately preceding Record Date. Any such consent by the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such holder and on all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate.</p>
    <p>As provided in the Trust Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registerable in the Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of transfer at the offices or agencies of the Certificate Registrar maintained by the Term Trustee in the City of Chicago, County of Cook and State of Illinois, accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Term Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate interest in the Trust will be issued to the designated transferee. The initial Certificate Registrar appointed under the Trust Agreement is The First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.</p>
    <p>The Certificates are issuable only as registered Certificates without coupons in denominations of $20,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Trust Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same; provided, however, that no Certificate may be subdivided such that the denomination of any resulting Certificate is less than $20,000. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Term Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection therewith.</p>
    <p>The Term Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Term Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Term Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or any such agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.</p>
    <p>The obligations and responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement and the Trust created thereby shall terminate upon the payment to Certificateholders of all amounts required to be paid to them pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the disposition of all property held as part of the Trust.</p>

    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
    <p>In connection with our proposed purchase of a certificate of beneficial interest (the “Certificate”), representing a fractional undivided interest in the K. C. ABBE® Trust 1995-1, issued under a trust agreement, dated as of Apr. 27, 1995 (the “Trust Agreement”), between Scribcor, Inc., an Illinois corporation (the “Seller”) and The First National Bank of Chicago, as owner trustee, acting thereunder not in its individual capacity but solely as owner trustee of the Trust (the “Term Trustee”) we certify that:</p>
    <p>1. We understand that the Certificate has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be sold except as permitted in the following sentence. We agree, on our own behalf and on behalf of any accounts for which we are acting as hereinafter stated, that such Certificate may be resold, pledged or transferred only to: (i) the Seller; (ii) an institutional investor that is an “Accredited Investor” as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) (an “Institutional Accredited Investor”) under the Securities Act (as indicated by the box checked by the transferor on the Certificate of Transfer on the reverse of the Certificate) acting for its own account and not for the account of others or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are Institutional Accredited Investors unless the holder is a bank acting in its fiduciary capacity) that executes a certificate substantially in the form hereof, (iii) so long as such Certificate is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”), to a person whom we reasonably believe after due inquiry to be a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A acting for its own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are “qualified institutional buyers” to whom notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, or (iv) in a sale, pledge or other transfer made in a transaction otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in which case (A) the Term Trustee shall require a written opinion of counsel (which will not be at the expense of the Seller or the Term Trustee) satisfactory to the Seller and the Term Trustee to the effect that such transfer will not violate the Securities Act, in each in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. We will notify any purchaser of the Certificate from us of the above resale restrictions, if then applicable. We further understand that in connection with any transfer of the Certificate by us that the Seller and the Term Trustee may request, and if so requested we will furnish, such certificates and other information as they may reasonably require to confirm that any such transfer complies with the foregoing restrictions. We understand that no sale, pledge or other transfer may be made to any one person for Certificates with a face amount of less than $20,000 and, in the case of any person acting on behalf of one or more third parties (other than a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) acting in its fiduciary capacity), for the Certificates with a face amount of less than $20,000 for each such third party.</p>
    <p>2. [CHECK ONE]</p>

    <heading>WITNESSETH:</heading> <p>I. DEMISE OF PREMISES</p>

    <p>2. All buildings, structures and other improvements presently situated or hereafter constructed upon the Land and all of the fixtures, facilities and installations of every kind and nature whatsoever now or hereafter located therein or thereon including, without limitation, all plumbing, gas, electrical, ventilating, heating and air conditioning systems, lighting, wiring, ducts, oil and gas boilers, burners, hot water heaters, signs and canopies, attached to or comprising a part of such improvements (collectively, “Improvements”);</p>

    <p>III. TERM AND RENEWAL</p>
    <p>A. The original term of this Lease shall be a period of twenty (20) years commencing upon the date hereof and expiring on Dec. 31, 2009 (the “Original Term” and each twelve (12) month period commencing upon the date hereof or any anniversary of the date hereof, a “Lease Year”), or until such term shall sooner cease and expire or as such term shall be extended, as hereinafter provided.</p>
    <p>B. Tenant shall have the right, at its option, to renew the Original Term for two (2) consecutive periods of five (5) years each (each, a “Renewal Term”), provided that at the date of the exercise of any of said options and at the commencement date of any Renewal Term no “Event of Default” (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred and be continuing, that at the time Tenant exercises its option to renew for the second Renewal Term it shall have duly exercised or shall simultaneously exercise its option to renew for the first Renewal Term in accordance with the terms hereof, and provided further that Tenant shall exercise each such option to renew by written notice to Landlord at least twenty-four (24) months prior to the expiration of the Original Term, or the then current Renewal Term, respectively or within sixty (60) days after “Landlord's Notice (as hereinafter defined), whichever is later, but in no event later than the expiration of the “Lease Term” (as hereinafter defined) if no Landlord's Notice is given; time being of the essence to Tenant's giving any of such notices by Tenant. Landlord shall endeavor to deliver to Tenant at least 26 months prior to the expiration of the Lease Term a notice (“Landlord's Notice”) stating that Tenant's right to renew the Lease Term shall expire on the later of (1) twenty-four (24) Months prior to the expiration of the Lease Term or (2) sixty (60) days after the delivery of such Notice. Prior to the exercise by Tenant of any of said options to renew the original Term, the expression “Lease Term”, shall mean the original Term; after the exercise by Tenant of any of the aforesaid options, the expression “Lease Term” shall mean the Original Term as the same may have been extended. If Tenant shall not have given Landlord notice in writing of the exercise of any of the foregoing options within the time periods hereinabove set forth, Tenant shall have no further right to renew the Lease Term; and if at the expiration of the Lease, should Tenant fail to vacate the Demised Premises, as hereinafter provided, Tenant's holding over shall be governed by the provisions of Article XXX hereof.</p>
    <p>C. Each Renewal Term shall be upon the same terms, covenants and conditions as provided in this Lease, except that upon the exercise of each Renewal Term, there shall be one (1) less Renewal Term remaining and the Rent payable during each Renewal Term shall be as set forth in Article IV A.2 hereof. If Tenant shall give notice of the exercise of an option in the manner and within the time periods hereinabove set forth, the Lease Term shall be renewed upon the giving of the notice without the requirement of any action on the part of Landlord within thirty (30) days after request by either Landlord or Tenant, Landlord and Tenant agree to execute and deliver an instrument in recordable form confirming that the term of this Lease has been extended.</p>
    <p>D. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event all or a portion of the Demised Premises has been subleased to not more than two subtenants, for a term, including renewals, which shall expire not more than three years after the expiration of the Lease Term, Tenant shall have the right, at its option, to renew the Lease Term for one additional period of either one, two or three years, so that the Lease Term shall expire after the expiration of such subleases provided that Tenant shall exercise such option to renew in accordance with Paragraph B of this Article III and further provided, Tenant shall have no further right to renew or extend the term of this Lease. The option provided for in this Paragraph D shall be exercisable whether or not Tenant then has the right to exercise any option provided for in Paragraph B above, but the exercise of the option provided for in this Paragraph D shall constitute a waiver by Tenant of any then unexercised options provided for in Paragraph B above. In no event shall Tenant enter into any such sublease which extends beyond the expiration of the Lease Term without exercising an option as provided in Paragraph B or in this Paragraph D.</p>
    <p>UV, RENT</p>

    <p>2. During the first Renewal Term, the annual Rent shall be $1,418,445. During the second Renewal Term, the annual Rent shall be $1,631,211. During the renewal term provided for in Paragraph D of Article II, the annual Rent shall be (i) if the option for such renewal term is exercised in lieu of the option for the first Renewal Term or the second Renewal Term, such annual Rent shall be that which would have been payable during the first Renewal Term or the second Renewal Term, as the case may be, or (ii) if such option is exercised during the second Renewal Term, such annual Rent shall be $1,875,893.</p>
    <p>B. All Rent and other payments to be made by Tenant to Landlord hereunder shall be in lawful money of the United States of America, and shall be made without any prior demand and without any set-off or deduction whatsoever, and shall be payable on the first day of each and every month during the Lease Term, at Landlord's office at the place to which a notice to Landlord is required to be sent hereunder, unless Landlord shall direct otherwise by notice to Tenant. Rent for any fraction of a month at the commencement or termination of the Lease Term shall be pro-rated. Tenant shall also pay without notice, except for such notice as may be required in this Lease, as additional rent, all costs, expenses, taxes, assessments, insurance premiums required pursuant to this Lease, cost of maintenance, repair and replacement required pursuant to this Lease, and other payments which arise from or are related to the Demised Premises or Tenant's use thereof or which Tenant in any of the provisions of this Lease assumes or agrees to pay, and, in the event of any nonpayment thereof, Landlord shall have (in addition to all other rights and remedies) all of the rights and remedies provided for herein or by law in the case of nonpayment of Rent.</p>
    <p>C. If Tenant shall fail to pay any installment of Rent or additional rent which is payable to Landlord for more than five (5) days after same is due and payable, Tenant shall pay interest on the amount due at a rate equal to five (5%) percent in excess of the rate then established by Citibank, N.A. in New York, N.Y., as its prime, base or reference rate (the “Interest Rate”), but in no event higher than the maximum interest rate permitted by law. Such interest shall accrue until the amount due is paid to Landlord and shall be deemed additional rent hereunder.</p>
    <p>V. NET LEASE</p>
    <p>A. This Lease is a net lease; accordingly, it is the purpose and intent of Landlord and Tenant that the Rent shall be absolutely net to Landlord, so that this Lease shall yield, net to Landlord, the Rent specified in Article IV hereof in each year during the Lease Term, and that all costs and expenses relating to the Demised Premises which may arise or become due during or out of the Lease Term shall be paid by Tenant.</p>
    <p>B. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Lease, this Lease shall not terminate, nor shall Tenant be entitled to any abatement, deduction, counterclaim, defense, deferment or reduction of Rent, or set-off against the Rent, additional rent or other charges payable hereunder, nor shall the respective obligations of Landlord and Tenant be otherwise affected, by reason of damage to or destruction of the Demised Premises from whatever cause, any taking by eminent domain, the lawful or unlawful prohibition, limitation, restriction or prevention of Tenant's use of the Demised Premises, the interference with such use by any private person, corporation or other entity, the impossibility of performance by Landlord, Tenant or both, any actions by governmental authority, or for any other cause whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, any present or future law to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however that nothing contained in this Paragraph D shall negate Landlord's obligations under or deprive Tenant of the full benefit of Article XXXII hereof; it being the intention that the obligations of Tenant hereunder shall be separate and independent covenants and agreements and that the Rent and additional rent and all other sums payable by Tenant hereunder shall continue to be payable in all events unless the obligations to pay the same shall be terminated pursuant to the express provisions of this Lease; and Tenant covenants and agrees that it shall remain obligated under this Lease in accordance with its terms, and that it shall not take any action to terminate, rescind or avoid this Lease, notwithstanding the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, winding up or other proceedings affecting Landlord or any assignee of Landlord. Except as provided in this Lease, Tenant waives all rights to terminate or surrender this Lease, or to any reduction, abatement or deferment of Rent, additional rent or any other sums payable hereunder.</p>
    <p>VI. TAXES: ASSESSMENTS; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</p>
    <p>A. Tenant does hereby covenant and agree to and shall, (i) pay, as additional rent, before any fine, penalty, interest or cost may be added for nonpayment, all real estate taxes, assessments, water and sewer rents, rates and charges, ad valorem taxes, gross receipts taxes, sales and use taxes, charges for public utilities, excises, levies, license and permit fees and other similar and dissimilar governmental charges general and special, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen of any kind and nature whatsoever which are, at any time during the Lease Term, assessed, levied, confirmed, imposed upon or become due and payable out of or in respect of or become a lien upon or against or which arise with respect to the Demised Premises or any part thereof; any Rent, additional rent or other sums payable hereunder; this Lease or the leasehold estate created hereby; or the acquisition, ownership, leasing, operation, occupation, possession or use of the Demised Premises by Landlord or Tenant (“Taxes”); and (ii) furnish to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after the last day on which the same may be paid without penalty, official receipts or other satisfactory proof evidencing such payment. All obligations contemplated by this Section shall be appropriately adjusted between the parties hereto with respect to the amount of any such obligations paid or payable by Tenant or Landlord subsequent to the termination of this Lease which are properly allocable to a period subsequent to the Lease Term.</p>
    <p>B. If, due to a future change in the method of taxation or in the tax method, a new or additional real estate tax, or a franchise, income, transit, profit, or other tax or governmental imposition, however designated, shall be levied against Landlord and/or the Land and/or Improvements in addition to or in substitution in whole or in part for any tax which would constitute Taxes, or in lieu of additional taxes, such tax or imposition shall be deemed for the purposes hereof to be include within the term Taxes. By way of limitation as to the previous sentence as to any such tax which is adopted in addition to any tax which would constitute Taxes, the same shall be deemed Taxes only to the extent that the same are applicable to real property and the proceeds thereof or owners or lessors of real property as opposed to taxes of general application. Nothing contained in this Article VI shall require Tenant to pay any municipal, state or federal income, capital gains, excess profit, estate, inheritance, succession, transfer, franchise, capital levy or other tax or assessment upon Landlord, all of which shall be the obligation of Landlord, except to the extent that such tax may be levied or imposed as provided in the first sentence of this Paragraph B. If at any time during the Lease Term, a tax or excise on, or measured in whole or in part by, rents or gross receipts is levied or assessed against Landlord or the Rent or additional rent expressly reserved hereunder in addition to or as a substitute in whole or in part for taxes assessed or imposed an land and/or buildings (such as, for example, the present Florida sales tax on rents, the Michigan single business tax, the City of Los Angeles gross receipt tax on rents, or the Philadelphia City or school district gross receipt tax; it being understood and agreed for the purposes of this Lease that the foregoing taxes are not of the nature which would be subject to the limitation referred to in the second sentence of this Paragraph B), the same shall be included within the term real estate taxes, and Tenant covenants to pay such tax or excise on, or measured by, rents or gross receipts, but only to the extent of the amount thereof which is lawfully assessed or imposed upon Landlord and which was so assessed or imposed as a direct result of Landlord's ownership solely of the Demised Premises or of this Lease. It is agreed that Tenant shall have the sole right to file an application for an abatement of real estate taxes or otherwise contest Taxes or the assessment of the Demised Premises for any tax year wholly or partially included within the Lease Term, that Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant in perfecting any such application, including, without limitation, the execution of any documents legally required to perfect such application and permitting same to be brought in Landlord's name (but at no cost or expense to Landlord) , and that Tenant shall retain any abatement, refund or rebate received on account thereof; except that if the last tax year shall be partially included within the Lease Term, then such abatement shall be prorated between Landlord and Tenant after first deducting therefrom Tenant's costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of obtaining the same.</p>
    <p>C. In the event that any amount levied or assessed against the Demised Premises may legally be paid in installments, Tenant shall have the option to pay such assessment in installments and shall only be liable for those installments which become due and payable during the Lease Term (subject to apportionment as provided in the last sentence of Paragraph A above).</p>
    <p>D. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall promptly (i) comply with, and cause the Demised Premises to comply with, and assume all liabilities and obligations with respect to, all Legal Requirements (as hereinafter defined) and Insurance Requirements (as hereinafter defined), whether or not compliance therewith shall require structural changes or interfere with the use and enjoyment of the Demised Premises or any part thereof; (ii) procure, maintain and comply with all permits, licenses and other authorizations required for any use of the Demised Premises or any part thereof then being made, and for the proper erection, installation, operation and maintenance of the Improvements; and (iii) comply with, and cause the Demised Premises to comply with, all reciprocal easement agreements, if any, affecting or related to the Demised Premises.</p>
    <p>1. Legal Requirements are deemed to be all laws, statutes, ordinances, orders, judgments, rules, regulations, permits, licenses and requirements of all governmental departments and agencies, which now, or at any time hereafter, may be applicable to the Demised Premises or the ownership, operation, use, occupancy or possession thereof, including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws (as hereinafter defined).</p>
    <p>2. Insurance Requirements are all terms of any of Tenant's insurance policies covering or applicable to the Demised Premises, all requirements of the issuer of any such policy, and all orders, rules, regulations and any other requirements of the applicable National Board of Fire Underwriters (or any other body exercising similar functions) applicable to or affecting the Demised Premises or the use, occupancy or possession thereof.</p>
    <p>E. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, may contest (and, if legally required, in the name of Landlord), by appropriate legal proceedings conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the amount or validity or application, in whole or in part, of any real estate tax or lien therefor or any Legal Requirement or Insurance Requirement provided that (i) such proceedings shall suspend the collection of any sums payable to satisfy any such liens or real estate taxes from Landlord, the Demised Premises, any interest therein, the Rent or any additional rent, (ii) neither the Demised Premises nor any part thereof or interest therein, or the Rent, or any additional rent, or any portion thereof, would be in any danger of being sold, forfeited, attached or lost by reason of such proceedings, (iii) Tenant shall have furnished such security, if any, as may be required by Landlord, (iv) with respect to the contesting of any Legal Requirement, Landlord would not be in any danger of any criminal liability by reason of such contest and the Demised Premises would not be subject to a forfeiture or a prohibition on occupancy as a result of failure to comply with any Legal Requirement, and (v) if such contest be finally resolved against Tenant, Tenant shall promptly pay the amount required to be paid, together with all interest and penalties accrued thereon. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (iii) above, Tenant shall not be required to furnish any such security in contesting any real estate tax or lien therefor or any Legal Requirement or Insurance Requirements provided (i) Tenant has paid the contested tax, lien or amount imposed by a Legal Requirement, or (ii) Tenant delivers to Landlord its most recent annual financial statement, which shall have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and certified by an independent Certified Public Accountant, which shows a net worth of Tenant equal to the greater of $50,000,000 or the product of (1) 50 multiplied by (2) the Rent and Taxes payable for the current Lease Year (“Tenant's Minimum Net Worth”) and provided that Tenant's most recent quarterly financial statement does not show a reduction in Tenant's net worth below its Minimum Net Worth. Landlord, at the expense of Tenant, shall cooperate with Tenant and execute any documents or pleadings legally required to perfect any such contest. Tenant shall indemnify and save Landlord harmless from and against any cost or expense of any kind that may be imposed upon Landlord in connection with any such contest and any loss resulting therefrom. Tenant shall give prompt notice to Landlord of Tenant's intention to contest as hereinabove set forth. In the event Landlord does not receive such notice on or before the date which is thirty (30) days prior to the last day such contest may be commenced, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, at Landlord's expense, to conduct such contest and file any and all papers and/or commence such proceedings as in Landlord's opinion may be necessary or desirable. Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord and execute any documents or pleadings legally required to perfect any such contest. If Landlord obtains any tax refund, same shall be paid to Tenant net of Landlord's expenses in obtaining same, or, if obtained in the last year of the Lease Term, such refund shall be apportioned between Landlord and Tenant.</p>
    <p>F. In case of default by Tenant in any payment to be made by Tenant as provided in this Article VI, Landlord, after ten (10) days written notice to Tenant and the continuation of such default at the expiration of such ten (10) day period, may, but shall not be obligated to, pay the amount of any such obligation with interest and penalties, if any, and the amount so paid by Landlord, with interest at the interest Rate from the date of such payment thereof by Landlord until repaid by Tenant, shall be deemed to be additional rent hereunder and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord within ten (10) days after demand.</p>
    <p>VlI. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE</p>
    <p>A. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall keep the Demised Premises, and all parts thereof, including, without limitation, all sidewalks, curbs, parking areas, access ways and landscaped areas, in good order, repair and condition, whether interior or exterior, structural or non-structural, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, including, without limitation, repair of all glass, utilities, conduits, fixtures, equipment, foundations, roofs, exterior and interior walls, heating and air conditioning systems, lighting fixtures, wiring, plumbing, sprinkler systems, paving, sidewalks, roads, parking areas, curbs, gutters and fences. All repairs made by Tenant shall be at least equal in quality and class to the original work. The necessity for and adequacy of repairs to the Demised Premises pursuant to this Article shall be measured by the standard which is appropriate for suburban office buildings in the Kansas City Metropolitan area (both Missouri and Kansas) of similar construction, class and age, provided Tenant shall in any event make all repairs necessary to avoid any structural damage or injury thereto. In connection with the making of any such repairs, Tenant shall comply with the provisions of Article VIII hereof. Tenant shall not commit any waste of the Demised Premises. Landlord makes no representation or warranty with respect to the condition of the Demised Premises or its fitness or availability for any particular use, and Landlord shall not be liable for any latent or patent defect therein.</p>
    <p>B. Landlord shall not under any circumstances be required to build any improvements on the Demised Premises, or to make any repairs of any nature or description whatsoever to the Demised Premises, whether ordinary or extraordinary, structural or nonstructural, foreseen or unforeseen, or to make any expenditure whatsoever in connection with this Lease or to maintain the Demised Premises in any way. Tenant hereby waives the right to make repairs at the expense of Landlord pursuant to any law in effect at the time of the execution of this Lease or thereafter enacted.</p>
    <p>C. If, during the last twelve (12) months of the Lease Term, Tenant is required pursuant to any Legal Requirement to make structural repairs or alterations to the Demised Premises (a “Mandated Repair”), then notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs A and B of this Article VII, the following shall apply. If a Mandated Repair must be completed prior to the expiration of the Lease Term, Tenant shall be responsible to complete same at its sole cost and expense. If, however, a Mandated Repair may be accomplished over a period of time which extends beyond the expiration of the Lease Term but work on such Mandated Repair must be commenced prior to the expiration of the Lease Term, then Tenant shall commence such work and shall be obligated to pay that portion of the work which is equal to the result obtained by pro-rating the total cost of the Mandated Repair over the period of time during which such Mandated Repair may or must be completed and allocating to Tenant the amount allocable to the balance of the Lease Term. If the Mandated Repair can be made during the period which follows the expiration of the Lease Term, then Tenant shall not be obligated to make such Required Repairs nor contribute to the cost of same. The provisions of this Paragraph C shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.</p>
    <p>D. Tenant shall keep the Demised Premises, and all parts thereof in a clear and orderly condition, free of trash and debris; shall keep the parking areas and sidewalks free of snow and ice; and shall keep all landscaped areas in a well-groomed condition.</p>
    <p>E. Upon the expiration or prior termination of the Lease Term, Tenant shall vacate and surrender the Demised Premises to Landlord vacant and broom clean and in as good order and repair as on the date hereof, ordinary wear and tear excepted and subject to any then unrepaired damage caused by fire or other casualty or condemnation which Tenant is not required to repair under Articles XIV or XV of this Lease or the repair of which has not been completed as of the date of expiration or termination.</p>
    <p>VIII. ALTERATIONS</p>
    <p>Subject to the next following sentence, Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, may make alterations or additions or other improvements to the Demised Premises or any part thereof, provided that (a) if Tenant is required to submit or file any plans and specifications with any federal, state, county, city or any other governmental or municipal authority, department, agency, board, office, commission or bureau or subdivision thereof (“Governmental Authorities”) for any such alterations, additions or improvements, Tenant shall deliver a copy of such plans and specifications to Landlord promptly after the filing of same, and (b) any alterations or additions or other improvements (i) shall not reduce the fair market value of the Demised Premises below its value immediately before such alteration, addition or improvement, or impair the usefulness or structural integrity of the Improvements or change the use thereof (but the foregoing shall not preclude the removal by Tenant of personal property not owned by Landlord), (ii) shall not reduce the gross leaseable area of the Demised Premises, (iii) are effected in a good and workmanlike manner, in a safe and careful fashion, and in compliance with all Legal Requirements and Insurance Requirements, and (iv) are fully paid for by Tenant. In the event that alterations, additions or improvements affect the exterior of the improvements or the plumbing, electrical or heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems of the Improvements (other than duct work or the location of sprinkler heads), or such alterations, additions, or improvements are structural in nature which shall be deemed to mean that they affect in any material way the columns, beams, floors, ceilings, interior ceiling-high partitions, slabs, roof or improvements facade, or change in a material way the interior layout of the Improvements, Tenant shall not commence any such alterations, additions or improvements until and unless Landlord shall have consented in writing to same, which consent Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay. Landlord shall be deemed to have consented to any alterations, additions or improvements requested to be made by Tenant pursuant to the preceding sentence, if Landlord does not provide Tenant with written notice of its objection to same within ten (10) business days of receipt of Tenant's written request with respect to any such alterations, additions or improvements. All other alterations, additions or improvements shall not require the consent of Landlord. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event shall Tenant have the right to demolish any part of the Demised Premises (other than non-structural improvements) without Landlord's consent. All such alterations, additions or other improvements shall be and remain a part of the realty and the property of Landlord, shall be subject to the terms of this Lease, and shall be surrendered to Landlord upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term.</p>
    <p>IX. TENANT'S EQUIPMENT</p>
    <p>Tenant, or any permitted subtenant hereunder may, at its sole cost and expense, install or assemble or place in, on or about the Demised Premises, and remove and substitute, any items of machinery, equipment, furniture, furnishings or other personal property used or useful in Tenant's or its subtenant's business that can be removed from the Demised Premises without material damage thereto, which property shall constitute Tenant's “Equipment”. Tenant's Equipment shall not include ceiling height movable partitions. Title to Tenant's Equipment shall be and remain in the Tenant or the applicable subtenant and Tenant or the applicable subtenant may remove the same upon the expiration or prior termination of the Lease Term or sublease term, as applicable; provided, however, that Tenant or any subtenant, as applicable, shall have no right to remove any such item which is necessary for the operation or maintenance of the Improvements as such, without regard to the nature of the business conducted therein, including, without limitation, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning equipment; and provided further that any of Tenant's Equipment not removed by Tenant or any applicable subtenant after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease shall be considered abandoned by Tenant or the applicable subtenant and may be appropriated, sold, destroyed or otherwise disposed of by Landlord without obligation to account therefore. Tenant shall pay all costs and expenses incurred in removing or disposing of Tenant's Equipment, whether removed by Tenant or Landlord, and shall repair, at its sole cost and expense, all damage to the Demised Premises caused by the removal of Tenant's Equipment, whether effected by Tenant, a subtenant or Landlord.</p>
    <p>X. LIENS</p>
    <p>A. Tenant shall cause to be paid all charges for all work done (labor and materials) upon the Demised Premises during the Lease Term and shall not suffer or permit any mechanics' or similar liens for labor or materials furnished to the Demised Premises during the Lease Term to be filed against the Demised Premises or any part thereof; and if any such lien shall be filed, Tenant shall either pay the same or procure the discharge thereof in any manner permitted by law within thirty (30) days after such filing. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord and save Landlord harmless from and against any and all loss, damage, claims, liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses arising out of the filing of any such lien.</p>
    <p>B. If a notice of mechanic's lien shall be filed against the Demised Premises for labor or materials alleged to have been furnished, or to be furnished at the Demised Premises, to or for Tenant or to or from someone claiming under Tenant; and if Tenant shall fail to take such action as shall cause such lien to be discharged within thirty (30) days after such filing, in addition to all other rights of Landlord hereunder, Landlord may pay the amount of such lien or discharge it by deposit or by bonding proceeding, and in the event of such deposit or bonding proceeding, Landlord may require the lienor to prosecute an appropriate action to enforce the lienor's claim. In such case, Landlord may pay any judgment recovered on such claim. Any amount paid or expense incurred by Landlord, as in this Section provided, and any expense incurred or sum of money paid by Landlord by reason of the failure of Tenant to comply with any provision of this Lease, or in defending any such action, shall be deemed to be additional rent for the Demised Premises, and shall be due and payable by Tenant to Landlord on demand, together with interest at the Interest Rate on the amount so paid by Landlord, from the date paid by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant. The receipt by Landlord of any installment of the regular stipulated Rent hereunder or any of said additional rent shall not be a waiver of any other additional rent then due.</p>
    <p>C. Nothing contained herein shall constitute any consent or request by Landlord, express or implied, to or for the performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the Demised Premises, nor as giving Tenant any right, power or authority to contract for or permit the performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as would permit the making of any claim against Landlord in respect thereof; and notice is hereby given that Landlord will not, under any circumstances, be liable for any labor, services or materials furnished to Tenant or to anyone having an interest in the Demised Premises or any part thereof through or under Tenant, and no mechanic's or other lien for any such labor, services or material shall attach to or affect the reversionary or other interest of Landlord in and to the Demised Premises, or in and to any alterations, additions or improvements to me made or erected thereon.</p>
    <p>Xl. UTILITIES AND SERVICES</p>
    <p>Tenant shall arrange for the procurement of and pay, or cause to be paid, all charges for electricity, power, gas, steam, water, telephone and other utilities and services, including, without limitation, cleaning and maintenance services, used upon or in connection with the Demised Premises. Landlord shall not be required to furnish any utilities or services to Tenant.</p>
    <p>Xii. INSURANCE</p>
    <p>A. Tenant agrees to, and shall, maintain at all times and at its sole cost and expense, insurance covering the Demised Premises as follows:</p>
    <p>1. All-risk property insurance with an agreed amount endorsement for the full replacement cost of the Improvements (with a deductible of not more than $25,000), excluding the costs of excavation and foundation;</p>
    <p>2. Commercial general public liability insurance against claims for bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on, in, under, at or about the Demised Premises in a combined single limit amount of $10,000,000 with respect to bodily injury or death arising out of any one accident or occurrence;</p>
    <p>3. Boiler and Machinery Insurance in the amount of at least $1,000,000 (with a deductible of not more than $10,000);</p>
    <p>4. Workers' compensation insurance to the extent required by the law of the state in which the Demised Premises are located in respect of any work or other operations in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises;</p>
    <p>5. During any period of constriction on the Demised Premises, builder's risk insurance on a completed value basis for the total cost of such alterations, additions or improvements, and workers' compensation insurance as required by applicable law if not already covered under the insurance provided for in Paragraph 1 or Paragraph 4 hereof;</p>
    <p>6. If and to the extent such insurance is commonly obtained by prudent owners of suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area (Kansas and Missouri) of similar construction, class and age to the Demised Premises, environmental impairment insurance in such amounts as are commonly obtained by such prudent owners; provided, however, Tenant shall not be required to carry such insurance so long as its net worth (as defined in Paragraph E of Article VI) exceeds Tenant's Minimum Net Worth; and further, provided, to the extent Tenant is required to carry such insurance because its net worth is equal to or less than Tenant's Minimum Net Worth, Tenant may maintain a deductible with respect to such insurance of not more than five (5%) percent of its net worth; and</p>
    <p>7. Such other insurance in such amounts, and against such risks, as are commonly obtained at the time in question by prudent owners of suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area (Kansas and Missouri) of similar construction, class and age to the Demised Premises, including, without limitation war risk insurance, earthquake insurance and flood insurance.</p>
    <p>B. All of the insurance required by this Article shall be written by companies of nationally recognized financial standing, reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, which are authorized to issue policies in the state in which the Demised Premises are located. The insurance maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Article or otherwise in respect of the Demised Premises shall name Landlord and Landlord's mortgagee as additional insureds as their interests may appear. The proceeds of the insurance maintained by Tenant under Section A.1 shall be payable in case of loss to the holders of any fee mortgages upon the Demised Premises as their interests may appear. All insurance maintained by Tenant shall provide that (i) no cancellation or reduction thereof shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days after receipt by Landlord of written notice thereof, and (ii) all losses shall be payable as provided in Article XIV notwithstanding any act or negligence of Landlord, Tenant, or any person or entity having an interest in the Demised Premises. Tenant, on the execution and delivery hereof, shall furnish to Landlord, and any mortgagee, certificates for such insurance, and not less than ten (10) days before the expiration of any such insurance, a certificate or binder evidencing the replacement or renewal thereof. Landlord agrees to obtain from any fee mortgagee to whom insurance proceeds are payable hereunder, an agreement that such fee mortgagee shall permit such insurance to be disbursed in accordance with Article XIV hereof.</p>
    <p>C. Tenant shall not take out separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required by this Article to be furnished by Tenant unless Landlord and any mortgagee are included therein as additional insureds, as their interests may appear, with loss payable as in this Article provided. Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord whenever any such separate insurance is taken out and shall deliver to Landlord, and any mortgagee, the policy or policies or duplicates thereof, or certificates evidencing the same, as provided in this Article.</p>
    <p>D. Should Tenant fail to effect, maintain or renew any insurance required to be maintained by the provisions of this Article, or to pay the premium therefor, or to deliver to Landlord, or any mortgagee, any of such policies or certificates, then and in any of said events Landlord, at its option, but without obligation to do so, may, upon ten (10) days' notice to Tenant, procure such insurance on Tenant's behalf. Any sums expended by Landlord to procure such insurance, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date expended by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, shall be deemed to be additional rent hereunder and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand.</p>
    <p>E. There shall be no apportionment of premium in respect of insurance maintained pursuant to this Article at the expiration Tenant may cancel any or any earlier termination of this Lease. Tenant may cancel any such policies as of such expiration or termination and obtain any premium refunds incident thereto. Tenant shall be entitled to any premium refund or dividend received by Landlord or Tenant on account of any insurance maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Article.</p>
    <p>F. Tenant hereby waives any and all rights of recovery, claim, action or cause of action against Landlord and Landlord's partners, trustees, agents, officers and employees, for any loss or damage that may occur to the Demised Premises, and to all majority of the arbitrators shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. Each arbitrator shall have at least ten (10) years experience in owning, operating or managing real estate in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas). If a party who shall have the right pursuant to the foregoing to appoint an arbitrator fails or neglects to do so, then, and in such event, the other party shall appoint a second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators appointed shall fail within fifteen (15) days after the appointment of the second arbitrator to appoint a third arbitrator, then either may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint such third arbitrator. The expenses of arbitration shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant but each party shall be responsible for the costs of its own counsel. Landlord and Tenant agree to, and hereby do, waive any and all rights they or either of them may at any time have to revoke their agreement hereunder to submit to arbitration and to abide by the decision rendered thereunder. The arbitrators shall have no power to modify the provisions of this Lease and their judgment is limited accordingly.</p>
    <p>XIII. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS</p>
    <p>A. Tenant agrees not to use, manufacture, store, dispose or sell any substance or material (collectively, “Hazardous Material(s)”), identified to be toxic or hazardous according to any applicable federal, state or local statute, law, rule or regulation, now or hereafter existing, relating to regulation or control of toxic or hazardous substances or materials, including, without limitation, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungiscide and Rodenticide Act, as any of the foregoing may have been or may be from time-to-time amended, supplemented or supplanted (collectively, “Environmental Law(s)”), including, without limitation, any asbestos, PCB, radioactive substance, methane, volatile hydrocarbons, industrial solvents, gasoline or petroleum products in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises (except for the existing fuel oil storage tanks at the Demised Premises which shall be used, operated and maintained at all times in compliance with all Environmental Laws) it being understood, however, that Tenant shall have no obligation to remove any asbestos from the Demised Premises other than visible asbestos as described in Paragraph F of this Article XIII, unless such removal is mandated by Environmental Law.</p>
    <p>B. If Tenant receives any written notice of the happening of any event involving the use, spill, discharge, dumping or cleanup of any Hazardous Material in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises or into the sewer, septic system or waste treatment system servicing the Demised Premises (any such event being hereinafter referred to as “Hazardous Discharge”) or of any complaint, order, citation, or notice with regard to such Hazardous Discharge or to air emissions, water discharges, noise emissions or any other environmental, health or safety matter affecting the Demised Premises or Tenant (any of the foregoing being hereinafter referred to as an ‘Environmental Complaint’) from any person or entity, including, without limitation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), then Tenant shall give immediate oral and written notice of same to Landlord and Landlord's mortgagee, detailing all relevant facts and circumstances with respect thereto of which Tenant has knowledge.</p>
    <p>C. If any Event of Default under Paragraph D of this Article XII occurs and is continuing, without limiting the foregoing, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise any of its rights as provided in this Lease with respect to an Event of Default or to enter onto the Demised Premises or to take such actions as may be required by any Governmental Authority to clean up, remove, resolve or minimize the impact of, or otherwise deal with, any Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint upon its receipt of any notice from any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, the EPA, asserting the happening of a Hazardous Discharge or an Environmental Complaint on or pertaining to the Demised Premises and requiring clean-up or other action to be taken. All costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in the exercise of any such rights, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date incurred by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, shall be deemed to be additional rent hereunder and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand.</p>
    <p>D. The occurrence of the following event shall constitute an Event of Default under this Lease:</p>
    <p>If the EPA, or any other local, state or federal agency asserts or creates a lien upon any or all of the Demised Premises by reason of the (a) presence of Hazardous Materials in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises, (b) occurrence of a Hazardous Discharge, (c) an Environmental Complaint, (d) any violation of any Environmental Law or otherwise; or if the EPA, or any other local, state or federal agency asserts a written claim against Tenant, the Demised Premises or Landlord for damages or cleanup costs related to the presence of Hazardous Material, a Hazardous Discharge or an Environmental Complaint on or pertaining to the Demised Premises; provided, however, such claim or lien shall not constitute a default if, within ten (10) days after Tenant receives written notice of such lien or claim:</p>
    <p>(a) Tenant shall commence and shall thereafter pursue with due diligence either: (i) the cure or correction of the event which constitutes the basis for the claim or lien, and continues with due diligence to pursue such cure or correction to completion, or (ii) proceedings for an injunction, a restraining order or other appropriate proceedings are brought by Tenant with due diligence seeking relief of the matter giving rise to the claim and the relief obtained thereby is not thereafter reversed on appeal; and</p>
    <p>(b) In either of the foregoing events, Tenant shall have posted any bond, letter of credit or other security required by law satisfactory in form, substance and amount to the agency or entity asserting the claim to secure the proper and complete cure or correction of the event which constitutes the basis for the claim.</p>
    <p>E. Tenant hereby agrees to defend, pay, protect, indemnify and hold Landlord, or any partner, officer, director, trustee or shareholder of Landlord, and any mortgagee with respect to the Demised Premises, harmless from and against any and all claims (including, without limitation, wrongful death actions and third party claims, but excluding claims for consequential damages) losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, causes of actions, suits, claims, demands, judgments, cleanup costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) arising directly or indirectly from, out of or by reason of the presence of any Hazardous Material in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises or any Hazardous Discharge in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises, or any Environmental Complaint related to the Demised Premises or due to a violation of any Environmental Law with respect to Tenant or the Demised Premises or as a result of Tenant's failure to comply with the provisions of this Article XII occurring either (i) during or attributable to the period prior to the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease and any other period of possession of the Demised Premises by Tenant or any affiliate of Tenant, or (ii) by reason of or attributable to Tenant's operations in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises.</p>
    <p>F. In addition to its obligations set forth in this Article, Tenant shall, on or before the first anniversary date hereof, remove any exposed asbestos in, on, under or about the Demised Premises. Such removal shall be accomplished in accordance and compliance with all Environmental Laws. In the event of Tenant's failure to comply with the foregoing obligations in addition to all other remedies of Landlord hereunder, Landlord shall have the right to apply the proceeds of the “Deposit” (as described in Article XXXIX hereof) to pay for the cost of the removal and compliance and in the event the cost thereof shall exceed the Deposit, the balance shall be paid to Landlord as additional rent within five days after demand.</p>
    <p>G. The provisions of this Article shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease with respect to the obligations and liabilities of Tenant hereunder, actual or contingent, which have arisen on or prior to such expiration or sooner termination.</p>
    <p>XIV. FIRE AND OTHER CASUALTY</p>
    <p>A. If the improvements, or any part thereof, shall be damaged or destroyed by fire, the elements or other casualty during the term of this Lease, then Tenant shall give prompt notice thereof to Landlord, and Tenant shall promptly thereafter repair or restore the Improvements to substantially the same condition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, they were in immediately prior to the casualty, and notwithstanding any contrary law, Rent shall not be suspended, abated or reduced as a result thereof. All insurance proceeds recovered on account of any damage or destruction by fire, the elements or other casualty shall be made available for the payment of the cost of the aforesaid repair or restoration. If the amount of said insurance proceeds plus the amount of any deductible applicable to said damage or destruction shall be less than One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars, said insurance proceeds shall be paid over to Tenant. If the amount of said insurance proceeds plus the amount of any deductible applicable to said damage or destruction shall be less than One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars or more, said insurance proceeds shall be paid to any bank or trust company in Kansas City, Missouri, designated by Landlord and shall be held in trust and shall be disbursed to Tenant, upon joint signatures of Landlord and Tenant, as the work of repair or restoration progresses upon certificates of the architect or engineer supervising the repair or restoration that the disbursements then requested, plus all previous disbursements made from said insurance proceeds, plus the amount of said deductible, do not exceed the cost of the repair or restoration already completed and paid for, and that the balance being held by Landlord is sufficient to pay for the estimated cost of completing the repair and restoration. All amounts held by such bank or trust company pursuant to the preceding sentence or by Landlord's mortgagee, as provided below, shall be invested in an interest bearing account until disbursed as provided in this Paragraph A, and the interest on such funds shall be added to the proceeds of such insurance for disbursement in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph A. If the insurance proceeds shall be less than the cost of repair or restoration, Tenant shall pay the excess cost prior to the disbursement of any insurance proceeds. If the insurance proceeds shall be greater than the cost of repair or restoration, the excess shall be paid to Tenant. All repairs and restoration shall be completed in accordance with Article VIII hereof. If Landlord's first mortgagee shall be a bank, insurance company or other recognized institutional lender, such mortgagee may hold any insurance proceeds which would otherwise be paid to the aforementioned bank or trust company and such proceeds shall be disbursed by such mortgagee as the repair and restoration work progresses upon its receipt of the certificates described above.</p>
    <p>B. In the event of damage or destruction during the second to last year of the Lease Term, the repair and restoration of which (as estimated and certified to by an architect or engineer designated by Tenant and reasonably approved by Landlord) would cost in excess of 75% of the replacement value of the Building, or in the event of damage or destruction during the last year of the Lease Term hereof, the repair and restoration of which (as estimated and certified to by an architect or engineer designated by Tenant and reasonably approved by Landlord) would cost in excess of 25% of the replacement value of the Building, Landlord or Tenant, upon written notice to the other given within thirty (30) days of such damage or destruction and the determination by the architect or engineer of the replacement value, as aforesaid, may terminate this Lease by serving upon the other at any time within said thirty (30) day period a ten (10) day written notice of its election to so terminate (but a sixty (60) day written notice shall be required in case of Landlord's election to terminate pursuant to this Paragraph B), provided that any and all insurance proceeds received by Tenant in connection therewith and the right to receive all insurance proceeds not previously paid by any insurance company insuring the Demised Premises shall be paid to and assigned to Landlord; and, subject to the following sentence, if such notice is given and such payment and assignment are made, this Lease shall cease and terminate and come to an end on the date specified in said notice as if said date were the date originally mentioned in this Lease for the expiration hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not have the right to terminate this Lease if any damage or destruction is caused by an uninsured casualty, or if Tenant fails to maintain the insurance required hereunder, or if Landlord is unable (other than by reason of its own acts), for any reason whatsoever, to collect all insurance proceeds which would otherwise be payable by Tenant's insurance carriers in connection with such damage or destruction (unless Tenant makes Landlord whole by paying any such shortfall).</p>
    <p>XV. CONDEMNATION</p>
    <p>A. Tenant hereby irrevocably assigns to Landlord any award or payment to which Tenant may be or become entitled by reason of any taking of the Demised Premises, or any part thereof (“Compensation”), in or by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, by any governmental authority, civil or military (“Condemnation”), whether the same shall be paid or payable in respect of Tenant's leasehold interest hereunder or otherwise, but nothing in this Lease shall impair Tenant's right to any award or payment on account of Tenant's trade fixtures, equipment and moving expenses, if available, to the extent Tenant shall have a right to make a separate claim therefor against the appropriate governmental authority, but in no event shall any such separate claim be based upon the value of Tenant's leasehold interest and in no event shall any such claim reduce the award which would otherwise be made to Landlord. Tenant agrees to execute any and all documents that may be required in order to facilitate collection by Landlord of any and all such awards. Landlord, and only Landlord may appear in any such proceeding or action to negotiate, prosecute and adjust any claim for any Compensation, and Landlord shall collect any such Compensation. Landlord shall pay all costs and expenses in connection with each such proceeding, action, negotiations prosecution and adjustment, for which costs and expenses Landlord shall be reimbursed out of any Compensation received. All Compensation shall be applied pursuant to this subparagraph A, and all such Compensation (less the expense of collecting such Compensation) is herein called the “Net Proceeds.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that any award paid on account of Tenant's trade fixtures, equipment and moving expenses or any award for a temporary taking of the Demised Premises shall be paid exclusively to Tenant.</p>
    <p>B. If all or substantially all of the Land or Improvements shall be taken in or by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, then this Lease shall terminate on the day preceding the date of the vesting of title to the Demised Premises or portion thereof in the condemning authority and Rent and additional rent shall be paid to the date of such termination.</p>
    <p>C. If a Condemnation shall affect at least 50% of the Demised Premises and, in Tenant's reasonable judgment shall render the Demised Premises unsuitable for restoration for continued use and occupancy of Tenant, then Tenant shall, not later than thirty (30) days after such Condemnation, deliver to Landlord (i) notice of its intention to terminate this Lease on the next rental payment date (the “Condemnation Termination Date”) which occurs not less than ninety (90) days after the delivery of such notice, (ii) a certificate of an authorized officer of Tenant describing the event giving rise to such termination, and (iii) an irrevocable offer by Tenant to Landlord to purchase on the Condemnation Termination Date any remaining portion of the Premises and the Net Proceeds, if any, payable in connection with such Condemnation (or the right to receive the same when made, if payment thereof has not yet been made), at a price equal to ten times the then annual Rent payable hereunder. In the event that Tenant exercises the right to terminate the lease provided in this paragraph C, then, in such event, not-withstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph A above, Tenant shall have the right to participate in any condemnation proceeding in connection with such Condemnation. If Landlord shall reject such offer by notice given to Tenant not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Condemnation Termination Date, this Lease shall terminate on the Condemnation Termination Date, except with respect to obligations and liabilities of Tenant hereunder, actual or contingent, which have arisen on or prior to the Condemnation Termination Date, upon payment by Tenant of all Rent, additional rent and other sums then due and payable hereunder to and including the Condemnation Termination Date and the Net Proceeds shall belong to Landlord. Unless Landlord shall have rejected such offer in accordance with this subparagraph, Landlord shall be conclusively considered to have accepted such offer, and, on the Condemnation Termination Date, there shall be conveyed to Tenant or its designee the remaining portion of the Demised Premises, if any, and there shall be paid and assigned to Tenant or its designee all its interest in the Net Proceeds, pursuant to and upon compliance with subparagraph D below.</p>
    <p>D. (i) If Tenant shall purchase the Demised Premises pursuant to subparagraph C hereof, Landlord shall convey or cause to be conveyed title thereto by special warranty deed, free of any mortgage imposed by Landlord and subject only to this Lease, the lien of any taxes, exceptions set forth in the title policy delivered to Landlord on even date, exceptions created or consented to or existing by reason of actions by Tenant, and all Legal Requirements.</p>
    <p>(ii) Upon the date fixed for any purchase of the Demised Premises by Tenant to subparagraph C of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the purchase price therefore specified herein in immediately available funds, together with all Rent, additional rent and other sums then due and payable hereunder to and including such date of purchase and there shall be delivered to Tenant a deed or other conveyance of the interests in the Demised Premises then being sold to Tenant and any other instruments necessary to convey the title thereto described in subparagraph (i) and to assign any other property then required to be assigned by Landlord pursuant hereto.</p>
    <p>(iii) There shall be no adjustments at closing except that Tenant shall pay all prepayment premiums or penalties charged by any mortgagee of Landlord. Tenant shall pay all charges incident to such conveyance and assignment, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, recording fees, title insurance premiums and all applicable transfer taxes (not including any income, capital gain or franchise taxes of Landlord) which may be imposed by reason of such conveyance and other instruments. Upon the completion of any purchase of the entire Demised Premises (but not of any lesser interest than the entire Demised Premises) but not prior thereto (whether or not any delay or failure in the completion of such purchase shall be the fault of Landlord), this Lease shall terminate, except with respect to obligations and liabilities of Tenant hereunder, actual or contingent, which have arisen on or prior to such completion of purchase.</p>
    <p>E. If (i) less than 50% of the Demised Premises shall be taken in or by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, or (ii) the use or occupancy of the Demised Premises or any part thereof shall be temporarily requisitioned by any governmental authority, civil or military, then this Lease shall continue in full force and effect without abatement or reduction of Rent, additional rent or other sums payable by Tenant hereunder, notwithstanding such taking or requisition. In such event, Tenant shall promptly after any such taking or requisition and, at its sole cost and expense, repair any damage caused by any such taking or requisition in conformity with the provisions of Article VIII of this Lease so that, after the completion of such repair, the Demised Premises shall be, as nearly as possible, in a condition as good as the condition thereof immediately prior to such taking or requisition, except for ordinary wear and tear. In the event of any such lesser taking in or by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings, Landlord shall promptly make payments to Tenant out of the Net Proceeds (which shall be held in trust for such purpose), and such payments shall be made in the same manner in which fire insurance proceeds are to be disbursed to Tenant pursuant to the provisions of Article XIV hereof. If there shall be any Net Proceeds remaining after the final payment has been made for such repair work, they shall be retained by Landlord.</p>
    <p>F. For purposes of this Lease, all amounts paid pursuant to any agreement with any condemning authority which has been made in settlement of any condemnation or other eminent domain proceeding affecting the Demised Premises shall be deemed to constitute an award made in such proceeding.</p>
    <p>XVI. SUBLETTING AND ASSIGNMENT</p>
    <p>A. Subject to the provisions of Paragraph F of this Article XVI and the other terms and conditions of this Article XVI, Tenant shall have the right to assign this Lease (in whole, but not in part), or sublet the Demised Premises (in whole or in part) without the consent of Landlord, provided that in the case of a subletting, no subletting shall be for a term ending later than one day prior to the expiration date of the Lease Term, subject, however, to the provisions of Paragraph D of Article III hereof. Landlord shall have the right to collect and enjoy all rents and other sums of money payable under any sublease of the Demised Premises following the occurrence of any Event of Default, and Tenant hereby assigns such rents and money to Landlord, such assignment to be effective upon the occurrence of any Event of Default.</p>
    <p>B. If this Lease be assigned or transferred in violation of the terms of this Lease, Landlord may, after default by Tenant, collect rent from the assignee or transferee, and apply the net amount collected to the Rent, but no such assignment or collection shall be deemed a waiver of any agreement, term, covenant or condition hereof (except that to the extent Rent or additional rent has been collected under the sublease, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit against any Rent or additional rent due and payable by Tenant hereunder), or the acceptance of the assignee or transferee as tenant, or a release of Tenant from the performance or further performance by Tenant of the agreements, terms, covenants and conditions hereof, and Tenant shall continue liable hereunder in accordance with the agreements, terms, covenants and conditions hereof.</p>
    <p>C. The merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all the assets of Tenant, shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease and shall be subject to all of the provisions of this Lease with respect to assignments, including, without limitation Paragraph E hereof. There shall be no restriction under this Article XVI applicable to the sale of all or any portion of the stock of Tenant to any third party, and such sale of stock shall not constitute an assignment of this Lease for any purposes under this or any other Article of this Lease.</p>
    <p>D. No assignment made shall be effective until there shall have been delivered to Landlord an executed counterpart of such assignment containing an agreement, in recordable form, executed by the assignor and the proposed assignee, wherein and whereby such assignee assumes due performance of the obligations an the assignor's part to be performed under this Lease from and after the effective date of the assignment to the end of the Lease Term. In no event shall any such assignment relieve Tenant of its obligations hereunder.</p>
    <p>E. It shall be a condition precedent to the merger of Tenant into another corporation or to the consolidation of the Tenant with one or more other corporations that the surviving entity or transferee of assets, as the case may be, shall (i) have a minimum net worth at least equal to the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, (ii) deliver to Landlord a certified financial statement evidencing the requirements set forth in the foregoing subsection (i), and (iii) deliver to Landlord an acknowledged instrument in recordable form assuming all obligations, covenants and responsibilities of Tenant hereunder; and Tenant covenants that it will not merge or consolidate or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets unless the foregoing requirements are met and such statement and instrument shall have been so delivered.</p>
    <p>F. No sublease shall be effective unless Tenant within ten (10) days after the execution of any sublease, shall deliver one fully executed original sublease to Landlord. Each sublease shall provide that it is subject and subordinate to this Lease and to the matters to which this Lease is or shall be subordinate and that in the event of any termination, re-entry or dispossess by Landlord under this Lease, Landlord, at its option may take over all of the right, title and interest of Tenant, as sublessor, under such sublease and such subtenant, at Landlord's option, shall attorn to Landlord pursuant to the then executory provisions of such sublease, except that Landlord shall not (a) be liable for any previous act or omission of Tenant under such sublease, (b) be subject to any offset not expressly provided in such sublease or which theretofore accrued to such subtenant against Tenant, (c) be bound by any previous or prepayment of more than one month's rent, or (d) be responsible for the repayment of security deposits not delivered to Landlord.</p>
    <p>G. Each subletting shall be subject to all the covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions contained in this Lease. Notwithstanding any such subletting to any subtenant and/or acceptance of rent or additional rent by Landlord from any subtenant, Tenant shall and will remain fully liable for the payment of rent, and additional rent due and to become due hereunder and for the performance of all the covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions contained in this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed and all acts and omissions of any licensee or subtenant or anyone claiming under or through any subtenant which shall be in violation of any of the obligations of this Lease, shall be deemed to be a violation by Tenant.</p>
    <p>H. It is understood and agreed that if Tenant should sublease all of the Demised Premises to one or two subtenants, then, upon request of Tenant, and provided the conditions set forth in Paragraph I below are satisfied, Landlord, within ten (10) business days after request therefor, shall enter into an agreement with such subtenants, substantially to the effect that in the event of any default proceeding against Tenant (i) Landlord will not make such subtenant a party defendant to such action, nor disturb its possession under its sublease so long as there shall be no default continuing by said subtenant under its sublease (after the expiration of applicable grace periods, if any), and (ii) such subtenant shall be recognized by Landlord as a direct tenant pursuant to such subtenant's sublease as if Landlord had executed such sublease as sublessor thereof; provided, however, that any such subtenant shall attorn to Landlord (any such agreement, or any agreement of similar import, being referred to in this Lease as a “Recognition Agreement”). Any such Recognition Agreement shall provide that the sublease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between Landlord and the subtenant upon all of the terms, conditions, and covenants as are set forth in the sublease, except that Landlord shall not (i) be liable for any previous act or omission of tenant under the sublease; (ii) be subject to any offset not expressly provided for in the sublease, which theretofore shall have accrued to the subtenant against Tenant; (iii) be obligated to perform any work; (iv) be bound by any previous modification of the sublease or by any previous prepayment of more than one month's rent, or additional rent, unless such modification or prepayment shall have been expressly approved in writing by Landlord; or (v) be obligated to repair the sublet space or the Improvements, or any part thereof, in the event of any casualty or in the event of partial condemnation. In connection with any Recognition Agreement, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, as additional rent, such reasonable attorney fees and disbursements as are incurred by Landlord in connection with any such Recognition Agreement.</p>
    <p>1. Any such Recognition Agreement shall be executed by the Landlord only under the following circumstances:</p>
    <p>(a) the rent and additional rent per square foot provided for in such sublease is a fair market rent, but in no event less than the Rent and additional rent per square foot payable hereunder;</p>
    <p>(b) the sublease does not provide for any up front lump-sum payment of rent or prepaid rent, and the sublease does provide for regular, equal monthly installments of rent which in any lease year are not less than the rent payable in the previous lease year; and</p>
    <p>(c) the sublet space consists of one or more full floors of the improvements.</p>
    <p>XVII. INDEMNIFICATION</p>
    <p>A. Tenant shall protect, indemnify, defend and save Landlord, and any officer, director, shareholder, trustee or partner of Landlord, and any mortgagee (collectively, Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party by reason of any of the following which occurs prior to the later of the expiration or the earlier termination of the Lease or the abandonment of the Demised Premises as described in Article XVIII(A)(vi); (a) any accident, injury to or death of persons, loss of or damage to property occurring in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises or connected with the use, condition or occupancy of any part thereof; (b) any use, misuse, act or omission, alteration, maintenance or repair of the Improvements by Tenant, its agents, contractors, licensees, or sublessees; and (c) any failure on the part of Tenant to perform or comply with any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Lease, including, without limitation, the provisions relating to Legal Requirements and Environmental Laws. Each indemnified Party shall give Tenant prompt notice of any such claim; and Tenant, at its sale cost and expense, shall contest, resist and defend any such claim, action or proceedings asserted or instituted against an Indemnified Party, with counsel of its choice, and may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same as it sees fit.</p>
    <p>B. The indemnity set forth in the foregoing Section A shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, but only as to matters covered thereby which arose or accrued prior to the later of the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease or the abandonment of the Demised Premises as described in Article XVIl(A)(vi).</p>
    <p>XVIII. CONDITIONAL LIMITATIONS; DEFAULT PROVISIONS</p>
    <p>A. Each of the following occurrences or acts shall constitute an event of default (an “Event of Default”) under this Lease:</p>
    <p>(i) If Tenant shall fail to pay any Rent, additional rent or other sum required to be paid by Tenant hereunder and such failure shall continue for ten (10) days after notice to Tenant of such failure; or</p>
    <p>(ii) If an Event of Default shall occur pursuant to Paragraph D of Article XIII hereof; or</p>
    <p>(iii) If Tenant shall fail to observe or perform any other provision hereof and such failure shall continue for thirty (30) days after notice to Tenant of such failure (provided, however, that in the case of any such default which cannot be cured solely by the payment of money and cannot with diligence be cured within such thirty (30) day period, if Tenant shall commence promptly to cure the same and thereafter shall prosecute the curing thereof with due diligence, the time within which such default may be cured shall be extended for such period as is reasonably necessary to complete the curing thereof with due diligence; and provided further that any failure to cure within said thirty (30) day period will not (a) subject Landlord or any mortgagee to prosecution for a crime, or (b) subject the Demised Premises, or any part thereof, to being condemned or vacated; or</p>
    <p>(iv) If Tenant shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall file a voluntary petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or an involuntary petition alleging an act of bankruptcy or insolvency shall be filed against Tenant under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or whenever a petition shall be filed by or against Tenant under the reorganization provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or under the provisions of any law of like import, or whenever a petition shall be filed by Tenant under the arrangement provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or under the provisions of any law of like import, or whenever a permanent receiver of Tenant or of or for the property of Tenant shall be appointed, and if any of the foregoing events occur and continue without the acquiescence of Tenant for a period of ninety (90) days, or in any other case at any time after the occurrence of any such event; or</p>
    <p>(v) If any event shall occur or any contingency shall arise whereby this Lease or the estate hereby granted or the unexpired balance of the Lease Term would, by operation of law or otherwise, devolve upon or pass to any person, firm or corporation except as expressly permitted in this Lease; or</p>
    <p>(vi) If Tenant shall abandon all of the Demised Premises by vacating the Demised Premises and failing to (i) maintain the Demised Premises, (ii) make all repairs thereto, (iii) maintain security and/or (iv) comply with all of the terms, covenants and provisions hereof, for a period in excess of thirty (30) days (and the fact that any of Tenant's property remains in, on, under, at or about the Demised Premises, shall not be evidence that Tenant has not abandoned the Demised Premises).</p>
    <p>B. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Landlord shall have the right to give Tenant a five (5) day notice of Landlord's termination of this Lease; and upon the fifth (5th) day next succeeding the giving of such notice, this Lease and the estate hereby g ranted shall expire and terminate on such date as fully and completely and with the same effect as if such date were the date herein fixed for the expiration of the Lease Term, all rights of Tenant hereunder shall expire and terminate (Tenant hereby waiving all rights of redemption), but Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter provided.</p>
    <p>C. No expiration or termination of this Lease pursuant to the foregoing Section B, or by operation of law or otherwise, shall relieve Tenant of its liabilities and obligations hereunder, all of which shall survive such expiration or termination.</p>
    <p>D. If any Event of Default continues beyond the applicable grace period, if any, Landlord shall have the following rights remedies, which rights and remedies shall not limit, restrict or otherwise modify any other rights or remedies of Landlord, including, without limitation, those set forth in the foregoing Section B:</p>
    <p>(i) Landlord shall have the right, without prejudice to any other right or remedy Landlord might have hereunder or by law or in equity and notwithstanding any forbearance or waiver of any prior default of Tenant hereunder, to re-enter the Demised Premises, to dispossess Tenant and any legal representative of Tenant or other occupants of the Demised Premises whose occupancy is subject and subordinate to this Lease, by a summary proceeding or other appropriate suit, action or proceeding or otherwise, and, at Tenant's expense, to remove, keep and/or dispose of (by sale, donation, destruction or otherwise) for the sole benefit of Landlord, Tenant's effects, all of which shall be deemed abandoned to Landlord and to have, hold and enjoy the Demised Premises and the right to receive all rental and other income of and from the same and Tenant hereby waives the service of notice of intention to re-enter or to institute summary proceedings to that end. No re-entry by Landlord shall be deemed an acceptance of a surrender of this Lease unless Landlord shall otherwise so elect in writing.</p>
    <p>(ii) In case of any such re-entry, termination and/or dispossess by summary proceedings or otherwise, (a) the Rent, additional rent, and any and all other sums payable by Tenant hereunder shall become due thereupon and be paid up to the time of such re-entry, dispossess and/or termination, together with such reasonable expenses as Landlord may incur for legal expenses, attorneys' fees and disbursements, brokerage, and/or keeping or putting the Demised Premises in good order and preparing the same for re-letting; (b) Landlord may re-let the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof, either in the name of Landlord or otherwise, for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Lease Term and may grant concessions or free rent; and (c) Tenant or the legal representative of Tenant shall also pay Landlord as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, for the failure of Tenant to observe and perform said Tenant's covenants herein contained, the amount set forth in Section E hereof. The failure of Landlord to re-let the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof shall not release or affect Tenant's liability for damages.</p>
    <p>(iii) Landlord shall have the right of injunction and the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as if re-entry, summary proceedings and other remedies were not herein provided for.</p>
    <p>(iv) Landlord, if it has not exercised its rights to terminate this Lease under Paragraph B or to re-enter the Demised Premises pursuant to this Paragraph D, may cure the default specified in Section A and may enter upon the Demised Premises to do so. In such case, Landlord may pay, or incur an obligation to pay, any sum of money or perform any other act necessary to accomplish the same. All sums so paid, and obligations so incurred, by Landlord and all necessary costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection therewith, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date so incurred by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, shall be deemed to be additional rent under this Lease and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord upon demand. Such cure by Landlord shall not release Tenant from any future duty or obligation under this Lease.</p>
    <p>E. In the event of any termination of this Lease under the provisions of Section B hereof or in the event that Landlord shall re-enter the Demised Premises under the Provisions of Section D hereof, Tenant will pay to Landlord as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, at the election of Landlord, either:</p>
    <p>(i) a sum which is equal to the excess, if any, discounted at eight (8%) percent per annum, of (x) the full amount of Rent reserved under this Lease for the balance of the unexpired portion of the original Term, or a Renewal Term, as applicable and the additional rents and other charges or sums payable by Tenant hereunder which would have been payable had the Lease not so terminated, over (y) the aggregate rental value of the Premises for the same period considered on a net rental basis, such sum to be immediately due in full upon such termination or re-entry; or</p>
    <p>(ii) a sum which is equal to the aggregate of the Rent reserved under this Lease for the balance of the unexpired portion of the original Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, and the additional rent and other charges or sums payable by Tenant hereunder which would have been payable by Tenant hereunder had this Lease not so terminated, or had Landlord not so re-entered the Demised Premises, payable upon the due dates specified herein following such termination or such re-entry and until the date for the expiration of the Original Term or such Renewal Term, as applicable, as provided herein; provided, however, that if Landlord shall relet the Demised Premises or any portion thereof during said period, Landlord shall credit Tenant with any rents or other amounts received by Landlord from such reletting.</p>
    <p>If the Demised Premises or any part thereof shall be relet by Landlord for the unexpired portion of the Lease Term, or any part thereof, before presentation of proof of such damages to any court, commission or tribunal, the amount of rent reserved upon such reletting shall, prima facie, be the fair and reasonable rental value for the Demised Premises, or part thereof, so relet during the term of the reletting.</p>
    <p>In computing such liquidated damages under clause (ii), there shall be added to the said deficiencies such reasonable expenses as Landlord may incur in connection with any re-letting, including, without limitation, legal expenses, attorneys' fees and disbursements, brokerage fees and expenses and for keeping or putting the Demised Premises in good order and preparing the same for re-letting. Any suit brought to collect the amount of the Deficiency for any period shall not prejudice in any way a proceeding for any other period with respect to a deficiency. Landlord, at Landlord's option, may make such alterations, repairs, replacements and/or decorations in the Demised Premises and advertise the same, as Landlord, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, considers advisable or necessary for the purpose of re-letting the Demised Premises or any part thereof; and the making of such alterations and/or decorations, or any other action by Landlord (except a written release executed and acknowledged by Landlord) shall not operate or be construed to release Tenant from liability hereunder as aforesaid. Landlord shall not be obligated to re-let or attempt to re-let the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof and the failure of Landlord to re-let the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof or the failure of Landlord to collect any rent due upon any re-letting shall not release or affect Tenant's liability, for such liquidated damages or other damages. Suit or suits for the recovery of such liquidated damages, or any installment thereof, may be brought by Landlord from time to time at its election and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Landlord to postpone suit until the date when the Lease Term would have expired if it had not been terminated under the provisions of Section B hereof, or, had Landlord not re-entered the Demised Premises under the provisions of Section D hereof.</p>
    <p>F. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting or precluding the recovery by Landlord against Tenant of any sums or damages to which, in addition to the damages specifically set forth in the foregoing Sections, Landlord may lawfully be entitled by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder.</p>
    <p>G. Mention in this Lease of any particular remedy shall not preclude Landlord from any other remedy, in law or in equity. The specific remedies to which Landlord may resort under the terms of this Lease are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other remedies or means of redress to which it may be lawfully entitled in case of any breach or threatened breach of any provisions of this Lease; and the exercise by Landlord of any one or more of the rights or remedies provided for in this Lease or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by Landlord of any or all other rights or remedies provided for in this Lease or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.</p>
    <p>XIX. LANDLORD'S RIGHT TO CURE TENANT'S DEFAULT</p>
    <p>If Tenant shall default in the payment, performance or observance of any agreement or condition in this Lease contained on its part to be paid, performed or observed and shall not cure such default within ten (10) days after notice from Landlord specifying the default (except that no notice shall be required in an emergency, as reasonably determined by Landlord), or shall not within said period commence to cure such default and thereafter prosecute the curing of such default to completion with due diligence, Landlord may, at its option, at any time thereafter cure such default for the account of Tenant, and any amount paid or any contractual liability incurred by Landlord in so doing shall be deemed paid or incurred for the account of Tenant, and Tenant agrees to save Landlord harmless therefrom and to reimburse Landlord in the amount so incurred by Landlord, including all reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements, together with interest on all said amounts at the Interest Rate, from the date(s) incurred by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, and all such amounts shall be deemed to be additional rent hereunder, and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand.</p>
    <p>XX. WAIVERS</p>
    <p>The failure of Landlord to insist in any one or more cases upon the strict performance of any of the conditions, terms, or covenants of this Lease shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of such or any other covenants, conditions or terms. The receipt by Landlord of any Rent, additional rent or other sum payable hereunder with knowledge of the breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach, and no waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease shall be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by Landlord. Landlord shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or threatened violation, of any covenant, agreement, condition or provision of this Lease or to a decree compelling performance of any covenant, agreement, condition or provision of this Lease, or to any other remedy allowed to Landlord by law.</p>
    <p>XXI. SUBORDINATION</p>
    <p>A. This Lease, and the lien hereof, and the rights of Tenant hereunder, are and shall be subject and subordinate in all respects to the lien of all present and future (a) ground leases, master leases, underlying leases, or grants of term of the Land and the Improvements or any portion thereof (collectively, including the applicable items set forth in subsection (c) below “Superior Lease”), (b) mortgages, deeds of trust, building loan agreements, and spreader and consolidation agreements (collectively, including the applicable items set forth in subsection (c) below, “Superior Mortgage”), and (c) all renewals, modifications, replacements, supplements, substitutions and extensions thereof, irrespective of the time of execution or time of recording of any Superior Lease or Superior Mortgage, provided that the holder of any such Superior Lease or Superior Mortgage (being hereinafter respectively referred to as “Superior Lessor” and “Superior Mortgagee”) shall enter into a Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement with Tenant on terms substantially as set forth in Paragraph B below.</p>
    <p>B. Landlord and Tenant agree that the Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement referred to in Paragraph A above shall provide that upon the termination of the Superior Lease or foreclosure of the Superior Mortgage, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between such Superior Lessor or Superior Mortgagee and Tenant in accordance with all of the terms thereof, including, without limitation, then unexercised rights to Renewal Terms and Tenant shall attorn to such Superior Lessor or Superior Mortgagee and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect upon all of the terms of this Lease except that such Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor shall not be (a) liable for any previous act or omission or negligence of Landlord under this Lease; (b) subject to any counterclaim, defense or offset, which theretofore shall have accrued to Tenant against Landlord; or (c) bound by any previous modification or amendment of this Lease or by any previous prepayment of more than one month's Rent, unless such modification or prepayment shall have been approved in writing by the Superior Lessor or the Superior Mortgagee, but this clause (c) shall be operative only if Tenant shall have been furnished with the name and address of the Superior Lessor or Superior Mortgagee before such prepayment or modification is made.</p>
    <p>XXII. EXCULPATION</p>
    <p>A. Neither Landlord, nor any partner, trustee, shareholder, officer or director of Landlord shall have any personal liability under this Lease. Tenant shall look only to Landlord's estate in the Demised Premises for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies for the collection of a judgment (or other judicial process) requiring the payment of money by Landlord in the event of any default by Landlord hereunder, and no other property or assets of Landlord or its shareholders, trustees, partners or principals, disclosed or undisclosed, or its officers or directors, shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies under or with respect to this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant hereunder or Tenant's use or occupancy of the Demised Premises.</p>
    <p>B. The term “Landlord” shall mean only the owner at the time in question of the Demised Premises, or of a lease of the Demised Premises, so that in the event of any transfer or transfers of title to the Demised Premises, or of Landlord's interest in a lease of the Demised Premises, the transferor shall be and hereby is relieved and free of all obligations of Landlord under this Lease accruing from and after the date of such transfer, and it shall be deemed, without further agreement, that such transferee has assumed and agreed to perform and observe all of the obligations of Landlord set forth herein during the period it is the holder of Landlord's interest under this Lease; provided, however, that any such Landlord transferor shall continue to be responsible to Tenant for matters arising prior to the transfer of this Lease to the extent of any sole proceeds received by any such Landlord transferor either as a result of a sale of the Demised Premises or an assignment of the Lease.</p>
    <p>C. If in this Lease it is provided that Landlord's consent or approval as to any matter will not be unreasonably withheld, and it is established by a court or body having final jurisdiction thereover that Landlord has been unreasonable, the only effect of such finding shall be that Landlord shall be deemed to have given its consent or approval; but Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant in any respect for money damages by reason of withholding its consent.</p>
    <p>XXIII. DELAYS</p>
    <p>In any case where Tenant is required to do any act (other than make a payment of money), delays caused by or resulting from Acts of God, war, civil commotion, fire or other casualty, labor difficulties, general shortages of labor, materials or equipment, government regulations or other causes beyond Tenant's reasonable control shall not be counted in determining the time when the performance of such act must be commenced and/or completed, whether such time be designated by a fixed time, a fixed period of time or a “reasonable time”.</p>
    <p>XXIV. BROKERS</p>
    <p>A. Each of Landlord and Tenant represents that it has, dealt with no real estate broker in connection with this transaction other than J. Scott Harrison of J. Scott Harrison &amp; Co. and Ted Murray of PCA Realty Corporation (collectively, the “Broker”) and Tenant shall pay any commission of the Broker pursuant to a separate agreement. Tenant hereby indemnifies, defends and holds Landlord harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), causes of action, suits or judgments of any nature arising out of any claims or demands asserted by any broker, agent or finder, licensed or otherwise, including, without limitation, the Broker, claiming to have acted on behalf of Tenant in connection with this transaction. Landlord hereby indemnifies, defends and holds Tenant harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), causes of action, suits or judgments of any nature arising out of any claims or demands asserted by any broker, agent, or finder, licensed or otherwise, other than the Broker, claiming to have acted on behalf of Landlord in connection with this transaction.</p>
    <p>B. The provisions of this Article XXIV shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.</p>
    <p>XXV. LANDLORD'S RIGHT TO INSPECT</p>
    <p>Landlord or Landlord's agents shall have the right to enter the Demised Premises at all reasonable times, upon one days' prior notice, except in an emergency, to inspect or examine the same (including environmental inspections), to show them to prospective purchasers, mortgagees or, during the last twenty four months of the term hereof or after an Event of Default of Tenant hereunder, lessees of the Demised Premises, and to make such repairs, alterations, improvements or additions as Landlord may elect to perform following Tenant's failure to make repairs or perform any work which Tenant is obligated to perform under this Lease and the elapsing of any grace period after notice as provided for herein and Landlord shall be allowed to take all material into and upon the Demised Premises that may be required therefor without the same constituting an eviction or constructive eviction of Tenant in whole or in part and the Rent shall in no wise abate while said decorations, repairs, alterations, improvements, or additions are being made. Except in an emergency, Tenant and Landlord shall not enter any area which Tenant reasonably designates as a security area where Tenant stores, or which contains valuable or proprietary items, without being accompanied by a representative of Tenant, unless such representative is not made available after request by Landlord. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be deemed or construed to impose upon Landlord any obligation, responsibility or liability whatsoever, for the care, supervision or repair of the Demised Premises or any part thereof.</p>
    <p>XXVI. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES</p>
    <p>Landlord or Tenant, promptly upon request of the other (or sublessee hereunder, in the case of Landlord), shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other (or any sublessee hereunder, in the case of Landlord), a certificate of Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, certifying (a) that the copy of this Lease which is annexed to such certificate is a true and correct copy of same, is unmodified and In full force and effect (or, if there have been modifications, that this Lease is in full force and effect, as modified, and stating the date of each instrument so modifying this Lease), (b) the dates to which Rent and Taxes due hereunder have been paid, and (c) whether, to the best knowledge of each signer, any default exists hereunder (or, in the case of a request by any sublessee, under the applicable sublease) and, if any such default exists, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof and what action Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto and whether notice thereof has been given to the other party. Any certificate required under this Article may be relied upon by a prospective purchaser, mortgagee or other transferee of Landlord's or (subject to the provisions of Article XVI) Tenant's interest under this Lease.</p>
    <p>XXVII. FEES AND EXPENSES</p>
    <p>Tenant covenants and agrees that in case Landlord shall be made a party to any litigation commenced against Tenant, then Tenant shall pay all expenses, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred by or imposed on Landlord by or in connection with such litigation, and Tenant shall also pay all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements which may be incurred or paid by Landlord in any successful action (which shall include a settlement of any action in which Landlord receives a benefit) to enforce the covenants and agreements of this Lease, and all such expenses, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements when paid by Landlord shall become at once a valid lien upon the improvements at any time situated on or in the Demised Premises and upon the leasehold estate hereby created, and shall be paid as additional rent hereunder, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date of payment by Landlord until the date repaid by Tenant, and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand.</p>
    <p>XXVIII. RENT CONTROL</p>
    <p>If at any time or times during the Lease Term the Rent and/or additional rent reserved in this Lease shall not be fully collectible by reason of any legal requirement (“Rent Control Law”), then Tenant shall enter into such agreement(s) and take such other steps as Landlord may legally request to enable Landlord to collect the maximum rents which may, from time to time during the continuance of such legal rent restriction, be legally permissible (but not in excess of the amounts reserved under this Lease). Upon the termination of such legal rent restriction, (a) the rents shall become and thereafter be payable in accordance with the amounts reserved herein for the periods following such termination and (b) Tenant shall pay to Landlord, to the maximum extent legally permissible, an amount equal to (i) the rents which would have been paid pursuant to this Lease but for such legal rent restriction less (ii) the rents and payments in lieu of rents paid by Tenant during the period such legal restriction was in effect. Further, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, if any Rent Control Law is in effect either (a) at the time Tenant exercises its right to renew the Original Term or any Renewal Term of this Lease or (b) on the last day of the then Lease Term, then Tenant's exercise of its renewal right shall not be effective if Landlord is unable to collect the Rent in accordance with Article IV hereof on account of such Rent Control Law and, in such event, this Lease shall terminate at the expiration of the then current Lease Term as if the renewal right had not been exercised. The foregoing notwithstanding, Tenant shall have the right to exercise its renewal right if Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord an amount equivalent to the Rent and additional rent which would be due during such Renewal Term and Landlord agrees to cooperate with Tenant in agreeing upon such alternative method of payment.</p>
    <p>XXIX. NO MERGER OF TITLE</p>
    <p>There shall be no merger of this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease with any other estate or interest in the Demised Premises or any part thereof by reason of the fact that the same person, firm, corporation or other entity may acquire or own or hold, directly or indirectly (a) this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease or any interest in this Lease or in any such leasehold estate, and (b) any such other estate or interest in the Demised Premises or any part thereof, and no such merger shall occur unless and until all persons, firms, corporations, and other entities having an interest (including a security interest) in (i) this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease and (ii) any such other estate or interest in the Demised Premises or any part thereof, shall join in a written instrument effecting such merger and shall duly record the same.</p>
    <p>XXX. SURRENDER; HOLDING OVER</p>
    <p>A. Tenant shall surrender the Demised Premises to Landlord upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, vacant and broom clean and in at least the condition as same had been upon the execution and delivery hereof, reasonable wear and tear excepted and subject to any damage by fire or other casualty or condemnation which Tenant is not required to repair under Articles XIV and XV of this Lease or which repair is not completed prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease. Tenant acknowledges that possession of the Demised Premises must be surrendered to Landlord at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. Tenant agrees to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from and against all cost, claim, loss or liability resulting from delay by Tenant in so surrendering the Demised Premises, including, without limitation, any claims made by any succeeding Tenant founded on such delay. The parties recognize and agree that the damage to Landlord resulting from any failure by Tenant to timely surrender possession of the Demised Premises as aforesaid may be extremely substantial, may exceed the amount of Rent and additional rent theretofore payable hereunder, and will be impossible to accurately measure. Tenant therefore agrees that if possession of the Demised Premises is not surrendered to Landlord within 24 hours after the date of the expiration or sooner termination of the this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord for each month and for each portion of any month during which Tenant holds over in the Premises after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, a sum equal to three (3) times the aggregate of that portion of the annual Rent which was payable under this Lease during the last month of the Lease Term. In the event of any holding over, Tenant shall also pay any additional rent which would have been payable under the terms of the Lease attributable to any such period of holding over, including Taxes. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to permit Tenant to retain possession of the Demised Premises after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. The aforesaid provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.</p>
    <p>B. If Tenant or anyone claiming under Tenant shall remain in possession of the Demised Premises or any part thereof after the expiration of the Lease Term without any agreement in writing between Landlord and Tenant with respect thereto, prior to acceptance of rent by Landlord, the person remaining in possession shall be deemed a Tenant at sufferance; and after acceptance of rent by Landlord, the person remaining in possession shall be deemed a Tenant from month to month subject to the provisions of this Lease insofar as the same may be made applicable to a tenancy from month to month. The aforesaid provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.</p>
    <p>XXXI. NOTICES</p>
    <p>Any notice and other communication given pursuant to the provisions of this Lease shall be in writing and shall be given by delivery by a nationally recognized courier service such as Federal Express, and except as may be expressly otherwise provided in this Lease, any such notice or other communication, shall be deemed given when so delivered to the addressee thereof or rejected by the addressee. If sent to Landlord, the same shall be delivered to Landlord, do Realty Holdings of America, 1370 Avenue of the Americas, 33rd Floor, New York, N.Y. 10019, Attn: Mr. Sanford Herrick; with a copy to Proskauer, Rose, Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn, 300 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022, Attn: Herbert T.

Leinbardt, Esq. Either party may change its address for notices by giving notice of such change to the other party by notice given in the manner herein provided.</p>
    <p>XXXII. QUIET ENJOYMENT</p>
    <p>Upon Tenant's paying the Rent, additional rent and all other sums payable by Tenant hereunder and performing and observing all of the other agreements and conditions on its part to be performed and observed hereunder, Tenant shall and may peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Demised Premises and all rights of Tenant hereunder during the Lease Term without any manner of hindrance or molestation by Landlord, or anyone claiming by, through or under Landlord.</p>
    <p>XXXIII. AFFIRMATIVE WAIVERS</p>
    <p>A. Tenant an behalf of itself and any and all persons claiming through or under Tenant, does hereby waive and surrender all right and privilege which it, they or any of them might have under or by reason of any present or future law, to redeem the Demised Premises or to have a continuance of this Lease after being dispossessed or ejected therefrom by process of law or under the terms of this Lease or after the termination of this Lease as provided in this Lease.</p>
    <p>B. If Tenant is in arrears in payment of Rent or additional rent, Tenant waives Tenant's right, if any, to designate the items to which any payments made by Tenant are to be credited, and Tenant agrees that Landlord may apply any payments made by Tenant to such items as Landlord sees fit, irrespective of and notwithstanding any designation or request by Tenant as to items to which any such payment shall be credited.</p>
    <p>C. Landlord and Tenant each hereby waives trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either against the other on any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, Tenant's use or occupancy of the Demised Premises, including, without limitation, any claim of injury or damage, and any emergency and other statutory remedy with respect thereto.</p>
    <p>D. Tenant shall not interpose any counterclaim of any kind in any action or proceeding commenced by Landlord to recover possession of the Demised Premises or for non-payment other than counterclaims which, if not asserted, would be waived.</p>
    <p>XXXIV. INTERPRETATION</p>
    <p>It is agreed that if any provision of this Lease or the application of any provision to any person or any circumstance shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then such determination shall not affect any other provisions of this Lease or the application of said provision to any other person or circumstance, all of which other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. This Lease shall be construed without regard to any presumption or other rule requiring construction against the party who caused this Lease to be drafted.</p>
    <p>XXXV. NO REPRESENTATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS</p>
    <p>Landlord and Tenant expressly acknowledge and agree that neither has made and is not making, and neither, in executing and delivering this Lease, is relying upon, any warranties, representations, promises or statements of the other, except to the extent that the same are expressly set forth in this Lease. All understandings and agreements heretofore had between the parties are merged in this Lease, which alone fully and completely expresses the agreement of the parties and which is entered into after full investigation, neither party relying upon any statement or representation not embodied in this Lease. This Lease shall not be modified in any way except by a writing subscribed by both parties.</p>
    <p>XXXVI. RECORDING</p>
    <p>Landlord and Tenant agree that a memorandum or notice of this Lease in the form annexed hereto and made a part hereof as Schedule B shall be executed at the time of the execution of this Lease and may be recorded by either party at Tenant's expense.</p>
    <p>XXXVII. HEADINGS</p>
    <p>The headings of the various-Articles and Schedules of this Lease are used only as a matter of convenience, and for reference, and are not to be considered a part of this Lease or to be used in determining or construing the intent of the parties to this Lease.</p>
    <p>XXXVIII. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS</p>
    <p>The agreements and conditions in this Lease contained on the part of Landlord to be performed and observed shall be binding upon Landlord and its heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and shall enure to the benefit of Tenant and its heirs, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns; and the agreements and conditions on the part of Tenant to be performed and observed shall be binding upon Tenant and its heirs, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns and shall enure to the benefit of Landlord and its heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.</p>

Simultaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, Tenant shall deposit the sum of Ninety-four Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($94,600) (the “Deposit”) in escrow with the Escrow Agent, which deposit shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Lease and the following additional provisions:</p>
    <p>(a) The Deposit shall be held in an interest bearing account, interest to follow the principal.</p>
    <p>(b) The Deposit shall be disbursed to Landlord upon notice to the Escrow Agent from Landlord that Tenant has not complied with its obligations under Article XIII(F) hereof, and that Landlord has incurred expenses as provided in said Article XlII(F) without the necessity for any further authorization or documentation.</p>

    <p>(d) If the Escrow Agent shall receive a written notice signed by both Landlord and Tenant authorizing and directing delivery of the Deposit, then the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit to the authorized recipient.</p>
    <p>(e) If the Escrow Agent shall receive a written notice from Landlord or Tenant as set forth in subparagraphs (b) and (c) above, claiming that the party delivering such notice is entitled to the Deposit, the Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver written notice (“Escrow Agent's Notice”) thereof to the other party, and unless such other party shall have delivered a written notice of objection to the Escrow Agent within ten (10) days after receipt by such other party of the Escrow Agent's Notice, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit to the party initially requesting it.</p>
    <p>(f) If (i) the Escrow Agent shall have received a notice of objection as provided for in subparagraph (e) above within the time therein prescribed, or (ii) any disagreement or dispute shall arise between Landlord and Tenant resulting in adverse claims and demands being made for the Deposit, whether or not litigation has been instituted, then, in any such event, at the Escrow Agent's option (x) the Escrow Agent may refuse to comply with any claims or demands on it and continue to hold the Deposit until the Escrow Agent receives written notice signed by Landlord and Tenant directing the disbursement of the Deposit in accordance with said direction, and the Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable in any way or to any persons for its refusal to comply with any claims or demands; or (y) if the Escrow Agent shall receive a written notice advising that a litigation over entitlement to the Deposit has been commenced, the Escrow Agent may deposit the Deposit with the clerk of the court in which said litigation is pending; or (z) the Escrow Agent, upon notice to the parties, may (but shall not be required to) take such affirmative steps as it may, at its option, elect in order to substitute another impartial party to hold the Deposit and to terminate its duties as Escrow Agent, including, but not limited to, the deposit of the Deposit in a court of competent jurisdiction and the commencement of an action of interpleader, the costs and expenses thereof, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements to be borne by whichever of Landlord or Tenant is the losing party and thereupon the Escrow Agent shall be released of and from all liability.</p>

    <p>H. The Escrow Agent shall perform only the duties expressly set forth herein. No other duties shall be inferred from this Lease, and the Escrow Agent shall not be required to refer to, or examine, any other instrument or document except as specifically provided for in this Article.</p>
    <p>I. The Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have no notice of, or duties with respect to, any agreement or agreements (whether or not a copy thereof is delivered to the Escrow Agent), other than as expressly set forth in this Article. The Escrow Agent may disregard any notice to it unless expressly provided for in this Article.</p>
    <p>J. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel (including members and employees of the Escrow Agent) and shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith on advice of such counsel. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be promptly paid by the parties pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 0 below. In no event shall the Escrow Agent have any liability under this Lease except for its own willful misconduct or gross negligence.</p>
    <p>K. The Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any modification of this Lease, including, without limitation, any modification of this Article; unless such modification is in writing and signed by both Landlord and Tenant, and the Escrow Agent shall have given its prior written consent thereto.</p>
    <p>L. The Escrow Agent shall not take any action by reason of any notice given by Landlord or Tenant or by any other person, firm or corporation, except only (i) such notices as are herein specifically provided for in this Article, and (ii) such instructions as are pursuant to orders or process of any court entered or issued with competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>M. In the event that any of the terms and provisions of any other Article of this Lease or any other agreement between Landlord and Tenant conflict or are in consistent with any of the terms and provisions of this Article, the terms and provisions of this Article shall govern and control in all respects as to the duties and liabilities of the Escrow Agent.</p>
    <p>N. Nothing herein shall preclude the Escrow Agent, in its capacity as a law firm, from representing Landlord or its partners or any affiliates thereof.</p>
    <p>O. Landlord and Tenant hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from and against any and all losses, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, including fees and disbursements of the Escrow Agent in its capacity as a law firm), assessments, liabilities, claims, damages, actions, suits or other charges incurred by or assessed against it for anything done or omitted by it in the performance of its duties hereunder, except as a result of its own willful misconduct or gross negligence. The agreements contained in this subparagraph survive any termination of this Lease or the Escrow Agent's duties hereunder.</p>
    <p>XL. DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS</p>
    <p>Tenant hereby waives any and all rights it may possess in and to any zoning, development or air rights affecting the Demised Premises. Landlord may (i) sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any and all zoning, development or air rights it may have in respect to (or which may be appurtenant or attributable to) the Demised Premises; (ii) merge the Land with any other zoning lot; and (iii) grant easements for light and air with respect to or affecting the Demised Premises, all of the foregoing without Tenant's consent, approval or waiver. Further, it is agreed that Tenant shall not have any interest in or right to dispose of such zoning, development or air rights. Tenant agrees to execute and deliver to Landlord within five (5) days of Landlord's request, a statement confirming the aforesaid. Tenant hereby appoints Landlord as Tenant's attorney-in-fact for the purpose of executing any instrument confirming that Tenant has no interest in or right to the zoning, development or air rights relating to the Improvements or the Land. The provisions of this Article shall not be construed as depriving Tenant of any rights necessary to allow Tenant to rebuild the Demised Premises as required or permitted pursuant to Articles XIV and XV of this Lease.</p>

    <p>This Lease shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri.</p>

    <p>PRELIMINARY STATEMENT</p>
    <p>A. Owner Trustee has acquired an estate for years in the Real Property subject to the terms of the Term Trust Agreement and the Lease and wishes to retain Servicer to provide certain services with respect to the Real Property and the Lease as more fully described herein, and Servicer desires to perform such services. The Certificateholders consent to such appointment by their acceptance of the Certificates.</p>
    <p>B. In consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained, the Owner Trustee and the Servicer hereby covenant and agree as set forth below.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE I</heading> <heading>DEFINITIONS</heading> <p>Section 1.01. Whenever used in this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, initially capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Appendix A hereto.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE II</heading> <heading>REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS</heading> <p>Section 2.01. Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

    <p>(g) No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance by Servicer of, or compliance by Servicer with, this Agreement, or the consummation by Servicer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;</p>
    <p>(h) To the best of Servicer's actual knowledge, neither this Agreement nor any statement, report or other document furnished or to be furnished by Servicer pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading;</p>
    <p>(i) Servicer has received and reviewed complete copies of the Term Trust Agreement and the Lease, and agrees that it shall (i) perform its obligations under this Agreement in full compliance with such documents and (ii) refrain from taking any actions which are prohibited by such documents, unless in each case of (i) and (ii) above it shall obtain the prior written direction of Owner Trustee to the contrary; and</p>

    <p>(a) any failure by Servicer to remit or deposit any payment required to be made under the terms of this Agreement, which failure continues beyond the second day following the date upon which such payment was due; or</p>
    <p>(b) any failure on the part of Servicer duly and timely to observe or perform in any material respect any other of the covenants or agreements on the part of Servicer set forth in this Agreement or in any agreement executed and delivered by Servicer in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, which continues unremedied for a period of 10 days (or such longer period of time (not to exceed 90 days) as may be required to cure such failure if the same is not susceptible of being cured within 10 days so long as Servicer has commenced such cure and diligently prosecutes such cure to completion) after the date upon which written notice of such failure requiring the same to be remedied shall have been given to Servicer by Owner Trustee; or</p>
    <p>(c) any representation or warranty made by Servicer in this Agreement shall be untrue in any material respect as of the date when made or at any other relevant time; or</p>
    <p>(d) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to Servicer.</p>
    <p>Section 8.02. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, and for so long as the same shall be continuing, Owner Trustee may, by notice in writing to Servicer and in addition to whatever rights Owner Trustee may have hereunder, at law or in equity, terminate (subject to the provisions of Section 9.03), all the rights and obligations of Servicer under this Agreement and in and to the Real Property and the proceeds thereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive any further Servicing Fees (excluding any earned but unpaid Servicing Fees, which shall be payable to Servicer after first deducting Owner Trustee's damages therefrom). On or after the receipt by Servicer of such written notice, all authority and power of Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Real Property or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in Owner Trustee or any successor appointed pursuant to Section 8.03. Servicer shall comply with the provisions of Section 8.03 with respect to the transfer of servicing and asset management obligations to such successor.</p>
    <p>Section 8.03. Successor to Servicer. (a) Prior to termination of Servicer's responsibilities and duties under this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02, or resignation permitted by Section 7.07, Owner Trustee may select a successor which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the responsibilities and duties (but not liabilities) of Servicer under this Agreement prior to the termination of Servicer's responsibilities and duties (but not liabilities) under this Agreement. If Servicer's duties and responsibilities (but not liabilities) under this Agreement are terminated, Servicer shall discharge such duties and responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires knowledge of such termination until the effective date thereof in accordance with the Servicing Standard, and with the same degree of diligence and prudence, which it is obligated to exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice the rights or financial condition of its successor. The removal of Servicer to this Agreement shall in no event relieve Servicer of its obligations and liabilities hereunder, or extinguish the remedies available to Owner Trustee to the extent provided herein.</p>
    <p>(b) Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Owner Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, whereupon such successor shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and obligations (but not accrued liabilities) of Servicer, with like effect as if originally named as a party to this Agreement. Any termination of this Agreement or any termination of Servicer shall not affect any claim that Owner Trustee may have against Servicer arising prior to any such termination or any claim under Section 8.08.</p>
    <p>(c) Servicer agrees to cooperate with Owner Trustee and such successor in effecting the termination of Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder, including, without limitation, the transfer to such successor for administration by it of all funds, if any, which at the time are being administered by Servicer pursuant hereto, or thereafter received with respect to the Real Property. Servicer shall timely deliver to the successor any Collections received by it, and all servicing files, books and records relating to the Real Property, and all other related documents, statements and funds relating to the Assets held by it hereunder. Servicer shall account for all funds and shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required to more fully and definitely vest and confirm in the successor all such rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and obligations of Servicer. All actions to be taken by Servicer pursuant to this Section 8.03 shall be taken at Servicer's sole expense without reimbursement therefor.</p>
    <p>Section 8.04 Waiver of Defaults. The Owner Trustee may, but only in accordance with Section 6.15 of the Term Trust Agreement, in writing, waive any default by Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent expressly so waived.</p>
    <p>Section 8.05. Remedies Cumulative. Owner Trustee shall be entitled to exercise any right or remedy that it may have pursuant to this Agreement, at law or in equity, and such exercise shall not preclude the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other such right or remedy, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies are cumulative and not exclusive.</p>
    <p>Section 8.06. Owner Trustee's Right to Cure. Owner Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, cure any Event of Default by Servicer under this Agreement at any time after notice and the lapse of any cure period to which such Event of Default relates, but without further notice. Whenever Owner Trustee so elects, all costs and expenses incurred by Owner Trustee in curing any such default, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, together with interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the amount of costs and expenses so incurred commencing on the day such costs are paid by Owner Trustee, shall be paid by Servicer to Owner Trustee within 20 days of demand.</p>
    <p>Section 8.07 Payment of Owner Trustee's Expenses. In the event Servicer fails to perform its obligations or is otherwise in default under this Agreement, all costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees (whether or not legal proceedings are instituted), involved in enforcing the obligations of Servicer under this Agreement, including the cost and expense of appointing a successor to Servicer pursuant to Section 8.03 after any termination of Servicer pursuant to Section 8.02, shall be due and payable by Servicer within 20 days of demand.</p>
    <p>Section 8.08. Indemnification. Servicer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties against any and all claims, losses (including market losses), penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees, and expenses that Owner Trustee may sustain in any way, related to (a) the failure (grossly negligent or willful) of Servicer to perform its Obligations in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, those terms relating to timeliness) and (b) any material breach of a representation, warranty or covenant made by Servicer in this Agreement, or in any schedule, statement, certificate or document furnished by Servicer pursuant to or with this Agreement. The obligations of Servicer under this Section 8.08 shall survive the termination of this Agreement or of Servicer and shall not be affected by any knowledge obtained by Owner Trustee in the course of its due diligence activities or otherwise.</p>
    <p>Section 8.09. Defaults by Owner Trustee. Subject to Section 5.03, if Owner Trustee shall fail to pay any amount required to be paid hereunder to Servicer within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor by Servicer following the date on which such payment was due, Servicer may terminate this Agreement upon fifteen (15) days written notice of such termination to Owner Trustee following the expiration of said thirty (30) day period, and Servicer shall be entitled in such event, to exercise any right or remedy that Servicer may have pursuant to this Agreement, at law or in equity.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE IX</heading> <heading>TERMINATION</heading> <p>Section 9.01. Termination. In addition to a termination pursuant to Section 8.02, the respective obligations and responsibilities of Servicer hereunder shall terminate upon the later of (a) the Final Distribution Date, and (b) mutual consent of Servicer and Owner Trustee in writing.</p>
    <p>Section 9.02. Termination without Cause. Owner Trustee may, at its sole option, terminate any rights Servicer may have hereunder, without cause, by giving 30 days written notice of termination to Servicer in the manner provided in Section 10.04. If Owner Trustee so terminates Servicer, Owner Trustee shall pay Servicer all accrued but unpaid Servicing Fees, including the amount of any Reimbursable Costs Servicer is entitled to receive pursuant hereto. On or after the receipt by Servicer of such written notices all authority and power of Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Real Property or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in any successor appointed pursuant to Section 8.03. Servicer shall comply with the provisions of Section 8.03 with respect to the transfer of servicing obligations to such successor; provided, however, in the event of a termination under this Section 9.02, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.03(c), Owner Trustee shall reimburse Servicer for its reasonable expenses of transferring to the successor the files and documents relating to the Real Property.</p>
    <p>Section 9.03. Rating Agency Confirmation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Article IX or in Section 8.02, no termination of this Agreement or of Servicer shall be effective unless and until (a) the Rating Agency shall have confirmed in writing that such termination shall not result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of its then assigned rating with respect to the Certificates at the time of any such termination.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE X</heading> <heading>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</heading> <p>Section 10.01. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Illinois without regard to principles of conflict of laws.</p>
    <p>(b) Servicer hereby irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any State or Federal court sitting in Chicago, Ill., in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such State or Federal court, Servicer agrees that any process or notice of motion or other application to any such court or a judge thereof may be served on Servicer within or outside such court's territorial jurisdiction by registered or certified mail or by personal service at Servicer's address set forth in Section 10.04, provided that a reasonable time for appearance is allowed.</p>
    <p>(c) Servicer irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any State or Federal court sitting in Chicago, Ill. and hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>
    <p>(d) Nothing herein contained shall affect the right of Owner Trustee or Servicer to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or to bring any action or proceeding against Servicer or Owner Trustee or its property in the courts of other jurisdictions.</p>

    <heading>SCHEDULE B</heading> <heading>SAMPLE OFFERING DOCUMENT LANGUAGE</heading> <heading>DESCRIBING BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY ISSUANCE</heading> <p>(Prepared by DTC-bracketed material may be applicable only to certain issues)</p>
    <p>1. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, N.Y. will act as securities depository for the securities (the “Securities”). The Securities will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co. (DTC's partnership nominee). One fully-registered Security certificate will be issued for [each issue of] the Securities, [each] in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC. [If, however, the aggregate principal amount of [any] issue exceeds $150 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $150 million of principal amount and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.]</p>
    <p>2. DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds securities that its participants (“Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among Participants of securities transactions, such as transfers and pledges, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in Participants' accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its Direct Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc., and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as securities brokers and dealers, banks, and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). The Rules applicable to DTC and its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
    <p>3. Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase, but Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued.</p>
    <p>4. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede &amp; Co. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede &amp; Co. effect no change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Securities; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.</p>
    <p>5. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.</p>
    <p>6. Redemption notices shall be sent to Cede &amp; Co. If less than all of the Securities within an issue are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.]</p>
    <p>7. Neither DTC nor Cede &amp; Co. will consent or vote with respect to Securities. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede &amp; Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Securities are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).</p>
    <p>8. Principal and interest payments on the Securities will be made to DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Direct Participants' accounts on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on payable date. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, the Agent, or the Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal and interest to DTC is the responsibility of the Issuer or the Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants shall be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.</p>
    <p>9. A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to have its Securities purchased or tendered, through its Participant, to the [Tender/Remarketing] Agent, and shall effect delivery of such Securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant's interest in the Securities, on DTC's records, to the [Tender/Remarketing] Agent. The requirement for physical delivery of Securities in connection with a demand for purchase or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Securities are transferred by Direct Participants on DTC's records.]</p>
    <p>10. DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Issuer or the Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor securities depository is not obtained, Security certificates are required to be printed and delivered.</p>
    <p>11. The Issuer may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depositor). In that event, Security certificates will be printed and delivered.</p>
    <p>12. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book-entry system has been obtained from sources that the Issuer believes to be reliable, but the Issuer takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.</p>
    <p>1. Issuer represents that at the time of initial registration in the name of DTC's nominee, Cede &amp; Co., the Securities were Legally or Contractually Restricted Securities,<sup>1 </sup>eligible for transfer under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the “Securities Act”), and identified by a CUSIP or CINS identification number that was different from any CUSIP or CINS number assigned to any securities of the same class that were not Legally or Contractually Restricted Securities. Issuer shall ensure that a CUSIP or CINS identification number is obtained for all unrestricted securities of the same class that is different from any CUSIP or CINS identification number assigned to a Legally or Contractually Restricted Security of such class, and shall notify DTC promptly in the event that it is unable to do so. Issuer represents that it has agreed to comply with all applicable information requirements of Rule 144A.</p>
    <p>2. Issuer represents that the Securities are [Note: Issuer must represent one of the following, and may cross out the other]</p>
    <p>[an issue of nonconvertible debt securities or nonconvertible preferred stock which is rated in one of the top four categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (“Investment-Grade Securities”)]</p>
    <p>3. If the Securities are not Investment-Grade Securities, Issuer and Agent acknowledge that if such Securities cease to be included in an SRO Rule 144A System during any period in which such Securities are Legally or Contractually Restricted Securities, such Securities shall no longer be eligible for DTC's services. Furthermore, DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Agent. Under any of the aforementioned circumstances, at DTC's request, Issuer and Agent shall cooperate fully with DTC by taking appropriate action to make available one or more separate certificates evidencing Securities to any Participant having Securities credited to its DTC accounts.</p>
    <p>4. Issuer and Agent acknowledge that so long as Cede &amp; Co. is a record owner of the Securities, Cede &amp; Co. shall be entitled to all applicable voting rights and to receive the full amount of all distributions payable with respect thereto. Issuer and Agent acknowledge that DTC shall treat any DTC Participant (“Participant”) having Securities credited to its DTC accounts as entitled to the full benefits of ownership of such Securities. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Issuer and Agent acknowledge that DTC shall treat any Participant having Securities credited to its DTC accounts as entitled to receive distributions (and voting rights, if any) in respect of Securities, and to receive from DTC certificates evidencing Securities. Issuer and Agent recognize that DTC does not in any way undertake to, and shall not have any responsibility to, monitor or ascertain the compliance of any transactions in the Securities with any of the provisions: (a) of Rule 144A; (b) of other exemptions from registration under the Securities Act or of any other state or federal securities laws; or (c) of the offering documents.</p>
    <p> <sup>1 </sup>A “Legally Restricted Security” is a security that is a restricted security, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3). A “Contractually Restricted Security” is a security that upon issuance and continually thereafter can only be sold pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act, Rule 144A, Rule 144, or in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4 of the Securities Act and not involving any public offering; provided, however, that once the security is sold pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144, including Rule 144(k), it will thereby cease to be a “Contractually Restricted Security”. For purposes of this definition, in order for a depositary receipt to be considered a “Legally or Contractually Restricted Security,” the underlying security must also be a “Legally or Contractually Restricted Security.”</p>

    <p>[Issue Description]</p>
    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
    <p>This letter sets forth our understanding with respect to certain matters relating to the above-referenced issue (the “Securities”). Trustee will act as trustee with respect to the Securities pursuant to a trust indenture dated Apr. 27, 1995 (the “Document”). William Blair &amp; Company is “Placement Agent” distributing the Securities through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). To induce DTC to accept the Securities as eligible for deposit at DTC and to act in accordance with its Rules with respect to the Securities, Issuer and Trustee make the following representations to DTC:</p>
    <p>1. Prior to closing on the Securities on July, 1995 there shall be deposited with DTC one Security certificate registered in the name of DTC's nominee Cede &amp; Co. for each stated maturity of the Securities in the face amounts set forth on Schedule A hereto, the total of which represents 100% of the principal amount of such Securities. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any maturity exceeds $150 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $150 million of principal amount and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount. Each $150 million certificate shall bear the following legend:</p>
    <p>Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (“DTC”), to Issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede &amp; Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede &amp; Co., has an interest herein.</p>
    <p>2. In the event of any solicitation of consents from or voting by holders of the Securities, Issuer or Trustee shall establish a record date for such purposes (with no provision for revocation of consents or votes by subsequent holders) and shall, to the extent possible, send notice of such record date to DTC not less than 15 calendar days in advance of such record date. Notices to DTC pursuant to this Paragraph by telecopy shall be sent to DTC's Reorganization Department at (212) 709-6896 or (212) 709-6897, and receipt of such notices shall be confirmed by telephoning (212) 709-6870. Notices to DTC pursuant to this Paragraph by mail or by any other means shall be sent to DTC's Reorganization Department as indicated in Paragraph 4.</p>
    <p>3. In the event of a full or partial redemption, Issuer or Trustee shall send a notice to DTC specifying: (a) the amount of the redemption or refunding; (b) in the case of a refunding, the maturity date(s) established under the refunding; and (c) the date such notice is to be mailed to security holders or published (the “Publication Date”). Such notice shall be sent to DTC by a secure means (e.g., legible telecopy, registered or certified mail, overnight delivery) in a timely manner designed to assure that such notice is in DTC's possession no later than the close of business on the business day before or, if possible, two business days before the Publication Date. Issuer or Trustee shall forward such notice either in a separate secure transmission for each CUSIP number or in a secure transmission for multiple CUSIP numbers (if applicable) which includes a manifest or list of each CUSIP number submitted in that transmission. (The party sending such notice shall have a method to verify subsequently the use of such means and the timeliness of such notice.) The Publication Date shall be not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date or, in the case of an advance refunding, the date that the proceeds are deposited in escrow. Notices to DTC pursuant to this Paragraph by telecopy shall be sent to DTC's Call Notification Department at (516) 227-4039 or (516) 227-4190. If the party sending the notice does not receive a telecopy receipt from DTC confirming that the notice has been received, such party shall telephone (516) 227-4070, Notices to DTC pursuant to this Paragraph by mail or by any other means shall be sent to:</p>
    <p>Manager; Call Notification Department</p>
    <p>The Depository Trust Company</p>
    <p>711 Stewart Avenue</p>
    <p>Garden City, N.Y. 11530-4719</p>
    <p>4. In the event of an invitation to tender the Securities, notice by Issuer or Trustee to Security holders specifying the terms of the tender and the Publication Date of such notice shall be sent to DTC by a secure means in the manner set forth in the preceding Paragraph. Notices to DTC pursuant to this Paragraph and notices of other corporate actions (including mandatory tenders, exchanges, and capital changes) by telecopy shall be sent to DTC's Reorganization Department at (212) 709-1093 or (212) 709-1094, and receipt of such notices shall be confirmed by telephoning (212) 709-6884. Notices to DTC pursuant to the above by mail or by any other means shall be sent to:</p>
    <p>Manager; Reorganization Department</p>
    <p>Reorganization Window</p>
    <p>The Depository Trust Company</p>
    <p>7 Hanover Square; 23<sup>nd </sup>Floor</p>
    <p>New York, N.Y. 10004-2695</p>
    <p>5. All notices and payment advices sent to DTC shall contain the CUSIP number of the Securities.</p>
    <p>6. Trustee shall send DTC written notice with respect to the dollar amount per $1,000 original face value (or other minimum authorized denomination if less than $1,000 face value) payable on each payment date allocated as to the interest and principal portions thereof preferably 5, but not less than 2, business days prior to such payment date. Such notices, which shall also contain the current pool factor and Trustee contact's name and telephone number, shall be sent by telecopy to DTC's Dividend Department at (212) 709-1723, or if by mail or by any other means to:</p>
    <p>Manager; Announcements</p>
    <p>Dividend Department</p>
    <p>The Depository Trust Company</p>
    <p>7 Hanover Square; 22<sup>rd </sup>Floor</p>
    <p>New York, N.Y. 10004-2695</p>
    <p>8. Interest payments and principal payments that are part of periodic principal-and-interest payments shall be received by Cede &amp; Co., as nominee of DTC, or its registered assigns in same-day funds on each payment date (or the equivalent in accordance with existing arrangements between Issuer or Trustee and DTC). Such payments shall be made payable to the order of Cede &amp; Co. Absent any other existing arrangements, such payments shall be addressed as follows:</p>
    <p>Manager; Cash Receipts</p>
    <p>Dividend Department</p>
    <p>The Depository Trust Company</p>
    <p>7 Hanover Square; 24th Floor</p>
    <p>New York, N.Y. 10004-2695</p>
    <p>9. [Note: Issuer must represent one of the following, and cross out the other:]</p>
    <p>Securities Eligible for DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement (“SDFS”) System.</p>
    <p>Other principal payments (redemption payments) shall be made in same-day funds by Trustee in the manner set forth in the SDFS Paying Agent Operating Procedures, a copy of which previously has been furnished to Trustee.</p>
    <p>Note 1</p>
    <p>The Certificates evidence undivided fractional interests in K.C. ABBE® Trust 1995-1, a special purpose grantor trust (the “Trust”). The Trust has been created and will be governed by the terms of an Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of Apr. 27, 1995, between Scribcor, Inc. (the “Grantor”) and the First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (the “Trustee”). The Property of the Trust will consist of: (i) a term-of-years real property interest expiring on Dec. 31, 2009 (the “Term Interest”) in and to the Old American Life Insurance Building, a three-story commercial office building located at 4900 Oak Street in Kansas City, Mo., (ii) the right, as Landlord, to receive all payments to be made on and after Aug. 1, 1995, by the Tenant of the Property under the terms of a Lease, dated as of Dec. 29, 1989, as amended, and (iii) the right to all monies and securities deposited or required to be deposited with the Trustee pursuant to any term of the Trust Agreement. Monthly payments with respect to the Certificates will represent a pass-through of monthly rental payments to be made by the Tenant pursuant to the Lease, and, as such, such payments will not be comprised of principal and/or interest components. For Federal income tax purposes, payments with respect to Certificates will constitute ordinary income in the hands of Certificateholders, subject to cost recovery depreciation deductions with respect to the Term Interest taken ratably over the 14-year term of the Term Interest.</p>
    <p>10. DTC may direct Issuer or Trustee to use any other number or address as the number or address to which notices or payments of interest or principal may be sent.</p>
    <p>11. In the event of a redemption, acceleration, or any other similar transaction (e.g., tender made and accepted in response to Issuer's or Trustee's invitation) necessitating a reduction in the aggregate principal amount of Securities outstanding or an advance refunding of part of the Securities outstanding, DTC, in its discretion: (a) may request Issuer or Trustee to issue and authenticate a new Security certificate; or (b) may make an appropriate notation on the Security certificate indicating the date and amount of such reduction in principal except in the case of final maturity, in which case the certificate will be presented to Issuer or Trustee prior to payment, if required.</p>
    <p>12. In the event that Issuer determines that beneficial owners of Securities shall be able to obtain certificated Securities, Issuer or Trustee shall notify DTC of the availability of certificates. In such event, Issuer or Trustee shall issue, transfer, and exchange certificates in appropriate amounts, as required by DTC and others.</p>
    <p>13. DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Trustee (at which time DTC will confirm with Issuer or Trustee the aggregate principal amount of Securities outstanding). Under such circumstances, at DTC's request Issuer and Trustee shall cooperate fully with DTC by taking appropriate action to make available one or more separate certificates evidencing Securities to any DTC Participant having Securities credited to its DTC accounts.</p>
    <p>14. Issuer: (a) understands that DTC has no obligation to, and will not, communicate to its Participants or to any person having an interest in the Securities any information contained in the Security certificate(s); and (b) acknowledges that neither DTC's Participants nor any person having an interest in the Securities shall be deemed to have notice of the provisions of the Security certificates by virtue of submission of such certificate(s) to DTC.</p>
    <p>15. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require Trustee to advance funds on behalf of Issuer.</p>

LURE® Trust 1995-1, a special purpose grantor trust (the “Remainder Trust”). The Remainder Trust will be created and governed by the terms of a Trust Agreement, dated as of Apr. 27, 1995, between Scribcor, Inc.

(the “Property”). Following expiration in 2009 of an underlying term-of-years to be purchased by an institutional investor, the Remainder Trust will hold fee simple title to the Property.</p>
    <p>The Property has been leased to Old American Life Insurance Company for an initial term expiring in 2009, and the obligations of Old American Life Insurance Company under the Lease have been guaranteed by Kansas City Life Insurance Company, a Missouri company (the “Lease Guarantor”).</p>
    <p>THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY ARE HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK (SEE “RISK FACTORS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS”). INVESTORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPRESENT THAT THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND UNDERSTAND THE TERMS OF THIS OFFERING.</p>
    <p>This Confidential Private Placement Memorandum is submitted in connection with the private placement of Certificates and may not be reproduced or used for any other purpose. The Seller reserves the right to accept or reject any subscriptions.</p>
    <p>THE CERTIFICATES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”), THE ILLINOIS SECURITIES LAW OF 1953, AS AMENDED, OR ANY OTHER STATE SECURITIES LAW. THIS PRIVATE OFFERING MEMORANDUM HAS NOT BEEN REVIEWED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, THE ILLINOIS SECURITIES DEPARTMENT OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY PRIOR TO ITS ISSUANCE AND USE.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE OFFERING</heading> <p>The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Private Offering Memorandum. Certain capitalized terms used in this summary are defined elsewhere in this Private Offering Memorandum.</p>
    <p>The Certificates</p>
    <p>The Certificates offered hereby evidence undivided fractional interests in K.C. LURE® Trust 1995-1, a special purpose grantor trust (the “Remainder Trust”). The Remainder Trust will be created and governed by the terms of a Trust Agreement, dated as of Apr. 27, 1995, between Scribcor, Inc. (the “Seller”) and The First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (the “Trustee”). The property of the Remainder Trust will consist of a current, fully vested unencumbered remainder interest in fee simple in real property (the “LURE® Interest”) comprised of the Old American Life Insurance Building, a three story commercial office building located at 4900 Oak Street in the Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City, Mo. (the “Property”). Following expiration in 2009 of an underlying term-of-years to be purchased by an institutional investor, the Remainder Trust will hold fee simple title to the Property.</p>
    <p>The Remainder Trust</p>
    <p>The Remainder Trust is a special purpose grantor trust created and governed by the terms of a Trust Agreement, dated as of Apr. 27, 1995 (the “Trust Agreement”), between the Seller and the Trustee. The Seller has established the Remainder Trust by selling and assigning the LURE® Interest to the Remainder Trust in exchange for $2,150,000. Prior to such sale and assignment, the Remainder Trust had no assets or obligations or any operating history. The Remainder Trust will not engage in any activity other than acquiring and holding the LURE Interest and issuing the Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>The LURE® Interest</p>
    <p>The LURE® Interest is a real property interest and constitutes a current, fully vested unencumbered remainder interest in fee simple in and to the Property. Following termination in 2009 of an underlying term-of-years held by an institutional investor, the Remainder Trust will hold fee simple absolute title to the Property, free and clear of any underlying indebtedness.</p>
    <p>Property Acquisition and Bridge Financing</p>
    <p>On May 4, 1995, the Seller completed the acquisition of fee simple title to the Property for a purchase price of $10,445,000. The Property consists of a 94,149 square foot office building (the “Building”) situated on a 2.091 acre parcel in the Country Club Plaza District of Kansas City, Mo. The Country Club Plaza District is located approximately 4.5 miles south of Downtown Kansas City. The Building was constructed in 1960 and substantial renovations were completed on the Building in 1992.</p>
    <p>In completing the acquisition of the Property, Seller caused the previous owner of the Property to “split” the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying to a single purpose grantor trust (the “Term Trust”) a term-of-years real property interest in the Property (the “Term Interest”), which Term Interest will terminate on Dec. 31, 2009, and (b) conveying to the Remainder Trust the LURE®) Interest, which will entitle the Remainder Trust, upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.</p>
    <p>The Seller established the Term Trust by assigning and selling the Term Interest to the Term Trust in exchange for $8,295,000, which amount was contributed to the Term Trust by K.C. ABBE Holdings, L.L.C. (“Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company, the sole members (equity holders) of which are principals or affiliates of the Seller or spouses thereof. Holdings was formed to facilitate the purchase of the Property pending completion of a private placement to institutional investors of certificates representing beneficial interests in the Term Trust (the “Term Trust Certificates”). Holdings financed its purchase of the beneficial interest in the Term Trust representing the Term Interest by incurring bank indebtedness in the amount of $8,295,000, which indebtedness and accrued interest thereon will be discharged with the proceeds of the offering of the Term Trust Certificates. See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS” and “THE TRUST AGREEMENT.”</p>
    <p>Investment Characteristics of the LURE® Interest</p>
    <p>The LURE® Interest to be acquired by the Remainder Trust is similar in many respects to a zero-coupon security, with payment “at maturity” occurring in 2009 at the expiration of the underlying term-of-years in the form of unencumbered fee simple absolute title to the Property. However, unlike the holder of a zero-coupon debt security, the Remainder Trust will not be subject to taxation of imputed interest on, or appreciation of, the LURE® Interest during the underlying term-of years.</p>
    <p>During the Term Interest expiring in 2009, the Term Trust will receive all net rental cash flow from the Property and will be responsible for all expenditures associated with conservation of the investment value of the Property, including maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc. The Remainder Trust will receive no financial benefits during the term-of-years and, correspondingly, will not be subject to any property-related expenditures during this period. The beneficiaries of the Term Trust will not have any financial claims against the Remainder Trust, as holder of the corresponding LURE® Interest, or any claims to any of the economic benefits to be derived from the Property following expiration of the term-of-years in 2009. Accordingly, upon the expiration of the term-of-years in 2009, the Remainder Trust, as holder of the LURE® Interest, will hold fee simple absolute title to the Property, free and clear of any underlying indebtedness. See “THE LURE® INTEREST.”</p>
    <p>The Lease</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the terms of a Lease, dated as of Dec. 29, 1989, as amended (the “Lease”), the Property has been leased to Old American Life Insurance Company (the “Tenant”) for an initial term expiring in 2009. The Lease is a so-called “triple net” lease, with Tenant assuming responsibility for taxes, insurance and operating expenses, obligations for repair and maintenance, and certain condemnation and casualty risks associated with the Building. See “THE LEASE.”</p>
    <p>The Lease Guarantor</p>
    <p>The obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been guaranteed by Kansas City Life Insurance Company (“Kansas City Life” or the “Lease Guarantor”). Kansas City Life and its wholly owned subsidiaries issue and market a full line of universal life, term and traditional whole life insurance and accident and health insurance products. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, Kansas City Life had consolidated revenues in the amount of $393.5 million, pre-tax income of $56.9 million and net income of $37.4 million. At Dec. 31, 1994, the Lease Guarantor had total assets of $2.7 billion and total stockholders' equity of $343.7 million. See “THE LEASE GUARANTOR.”</p>
    <p>Certain Tax Matters</p>
    <p>In the opinion of Kirkland &amp; Ellis, special tax counsel to the Seller, the Remainder Trust will be classified for Federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Accordingly, each holder of a Certificate will be subject to Federal income taxation as if it owned directly its proportionate interest in each asset owned by the Trust. See “FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS.”</p>
    <p>The Seller and Affiliates</p>
    <p>Scribcor, Inc. (the “Seller”) is the grantor of the Remainder Trust and an affiliate of Electrum Partners L.L.C (“Electrum”), a newly-formed Illinois limited liability company. Principals of Electrum have been engaged for over the past three years in developing the proprietary software and technology associated with originating and pricing the term and residual components of commercial real estate.</p>
    <p>The principal officers and majority owners of Electrum are Richard M. Ross, Jr. and Richard A. Graff.</p>
    <p>Mr. Ross is President of Scribcor, Inc., and has been associated with Scribcor in various administrative capacities since 1971. Scribcor, founded in 1891, is a privately-held firm focusing on management, leasing and consulting in the Chicago commercial and industrial real estate market.

He has provided confidential consulting services to numerous major corporations. Mr. Ross is a graduate of Denison University and holds an MBA in Finance from the University of Chicago. He is a member of the American Society of Real Estate Counselors (ASREC) and the Urban Land Institute.</p>

    <p>INVESTOR SUITABILITY</p>
    <p>An investment in the Certificates involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for persons who understand the merits and risks involved and who have financial resources sufficient to bear the economic risks of investing in the Seller. The Certificates are being offered without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), pursuant to the exemptions provided by Regulation D thereunder.</p>
    <p>An investment in Certificates is available only to prospective investors who meet the requirements described below or who the Sellers otherwise determine to be suitable investors.</p>
    <p>Each subscriber for Certificates must represent that he:</p>
    <p>(a) has an individual net worth, or joint net worth with his spouse, in excess of $1,000,000; or has had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with his spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year; or otherwise qualifies as an “Accredited Investor” as that term is defined in Rule 501 (a) of Regulation D to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended;</p>
    <p>(b) has an overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable that is reasonable in relation and not disproportionate to his net worth and his investment in the Certificates will not cause such overall commitment to become excessive, and the investment in the Certificates will not exceed 20% of the subscriber's net worth (exclusive of principal residence, furnishings and automobiles);</p>
    <p>(c) is willing and able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Certificates, has no need for liquidity with respect to this investment and is able to sustain a complete loss of his investment in the Certificates;</p>
    <p>(d) has read this Confidential Private Placement Memorandum for purposes of evaluating the risks of investing in the Certificates;</p>
    <p>(e) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, in general, and in health care investments, in particular, to believe that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Certificates;</p>

    <p>(g) is a United States citizen or is treated as a United States citizen for federal income tax purposes.</p>
    <p>The foregoing is a summary of certain of the investor suitability and other requirements set forth in the Subscription Agreement and Suitability Statement included as Exhibit A hereto. The investor suitability requirements set forth above represent minimum suitability requirements for prospective purchasers and the satisfaction of such standards by a prospective purchaser does not necessarily mean that the Certificates are a suitable investment for such purchaser. The Seller, in circumstances it considers appropriate, may modify such requirements (including the “Accredited Investor” requirement), without notice, for any reason.</p>
    <p>The foregoing representations will be reviewed to determine the suitability of prospective purchasers, and the Seller will have the right to refuse a subscription for a Certificate or Certificates if in its sole discretion it believes that the prospective purchaser does not meet the suitability requirements or that the Certificates are otherwise an unsuitable investment for the prospective purchaser. The Seller will have sole discretion regarding the acceptance or rejection of any subscription to purchase Certificates.</p>
    <p>It is anticipated that comparable suitability standards will be imposed by the Seller in connection with any resales of the Certificates; any such resale is subject to various restrictions and consequences. See “Transfers”.</p>
    <p>In the event that the Seller or one or more affiliates of the Seller purchase unsold Certificates, certain of the provisions set forth above may be waived provided that such purchase will not result in the loss of an applicable securities law exemption. Any resale of such unsold Certificates, however, will be made only to persons meeting the foregoing criteria.</p>
    <p>OFFERING TERMS</p>
    <p>The Seller is offering hereby a total of approximately 43 Certificates. The Certificates are being offered at a purchase price of $50,000 per Certificate. The purchase price will be payable in full upon subscription. The minimum subscription is one Certificate, although the Seller reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to accept subscriptions for fractional Certificates.</p>
    <p>Except as provided below, the Certificates will be sold only to such persons who meet the suitability standards set forth under “Investor Suitability.” The Certificates will be sold by the Seller on a best efforts basis and no commissions will be payable in connection therewith.</p>
    <p>The offering period will terminate on or before Jun. 1, 1995, unless extended to a date not later than Dec. 31, 1995 (the “Offering Period”). The Seller may terminate the offering at any time.</p>

The Subscription Agreement contains a power of attorney authorizing the Seller to sign certain documents on behalf of the subscriber. A subscriber will have no right to withdraw his subscription after the acceptance thereof by the Seller. Except as described under the caption “Additional Inquiries,” no party has been authorized to give any information or to make any representations other than those contained in this Offering Memorandum, and any such representations may not be relied upon.</p>
    <p>ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND BRIDGE FINANCING</p>
    <p>On May 4, 1995, the Seller completed the acquisition of fee simple title to the Property for a purchase price of $10,445,000. In completing the acquisition of the Property, the Seller caused the previous owner of the Property to “split” the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Term Trust the Term Interest expiring on Dec. 31, 2009 and (b) conveying or causing to be conveyed to the Remainder Trust, in exchange for $2,150,000, a remainder interest in the Property, which remainder interest will entitle the beneficiaries of the Remainder Trust, upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.</p>
    <p>The Seller established the Term Trust by assigning and selling the Term Interest to the Term Trust in exchange for $8,295,000, which amount was contributed to the Term Trust by K.C. ABBE Holdings, L.L.C. (“Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company of which the sole members (equity holders) are principals or affiliates of the Seller or spouses thereof. Holdings was formed to facilitate the purchase of the Property pending completion of a private placement of certificates evidencing beneficial interests in the Term Trust (the “Term Trust Certificates”). Holdings financed its purchase of the beneficial interest in the Term Trust representing the Term Interest by incurring bank indebtedness (the “Bridge Financing”) in the amount of $8,295,000, which indebtedness and accrued interest thereon will be discharged with the anticipated proceeds of the offering of Term Trust Certificates. See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS.”</p>
    <p>See Exhibit B hereto for a copy of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of Jan. 13, 1995 (the “Acquisition Agreement”), contemplating the purchase of the Property. The $10.445 million purchase price represents a capitalization of the Building's operating income for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994 at a rate of 8.93%, a capitalization of projected operating income for the year ending Dec. 31, 2000 at a rate of 10.27%, and a capitalization of projected operating income for the year ending Dec. 31, 2005 at a rate of 11.81%</p>
    <p>ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS</p>
    <p>Set forth below is a summary of the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the (a) purchase of the Property on May 4, 1995 by the Seller for $10,455,000, utilizing the proceeds of the Bridge Financing and the sale by the Seller of the LURE® Interest to the Remainder Trust for $2,150,000, and the issuance of the Certificates for $2,150,000 and organization of the Remainder Trust and (b) the organization of the Term Trust and the proposed issuance of the Term Trust Certificates on or about Jul. 15, 1995. The information set forth below represents the best estimate of the Seller and is subject to change.</p>

    <p>(1) Estimated solely for purposes of this presentation. The actual proceeds to be realized upon issuance of the Term Trust Certificates will depend upon prevailing interest rates at the time of issuance of the Term Trust Certificates.</p>
    <p>(2) The Seller will be reimbursed for all legal, accounting and filing fees related to the organization of the Remainder Trust, the Term Trust, the preparation of the Trust Agreement and this Offering Memorandum and related organizational expenses.</p>
    <p>RISK FACTORS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</p>
    <p>The purchase of Certificates involves substantial risks for investors. In addition to general investment risks and the factors described elsewhere herein, a prospective purchaser of Certificates should consider the following factors.</p>
    <p>Real Estate Investment Risks</p>
    <p>An investment in Certificates will be subject to many of the risks generally associated with the ownership of unleveraged real property, including the possibility of adverse changes in national and local economic conditions; changes in rates of inflation; changes in the real estate investment climate; adverse changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics; adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; natural disasters, including earthquakes and other factors which are beyond the control of the Seller. The success of an investment in the Certificates will depend in large part upon the ability of the Trustee to re-lease the Property upon the completion of the Term Interest in 2009.</p>
    <p>Condemnation Risk</p>
    <p>As described below, under certain circumstances during the early years of the underlying Term Interest, a “taking” of the Property by means of eminent domain or other governmental proceedings (a “condemnation”) resulting in a termination of the Lease could result in loss of all, or a significant portion, of a Certificateholder's investment.</p>
    <p>If a condemnation affects more than 50% of the Building and, in Tenant's reasonable judgment, renders the Building unsuitable for restoration for continued use and occupancy (a “Total Condemnation”), then Tenant is required to terminate the Lease and submit an irrevocable offer to purchase from the Term Trust (a) any remaining portion of the Building and (b) the right to receive the net proceeds, if any, payable in connection with such condemnation. The purchase price shall be equal to ten times the then-annual Base Rent payable under the Lease, which amount will not be less than $9,326,500. In accordance with the terms of the Term Trust, the Term Trustee is required to accept such offer to purchase, and proceeds received by the Term Trust from the Tenant upon the occurrence of a Total Condemnation are to be distributed, first, to holders of Term Trust Certificates solely to the extent of the applicable Prepayment Amount, and second, if and only to the extent of any remaining proceeds, to the Remainder Trustee for distribution to holders of Certificates. The applicable “Prepayment Amount” at any date with respect to holders of Term Trust Certificates will be an amount generally equal to the present value of the then-remaining monthly lease payments otherwise to be made under the Lease, discounted to the date of prepayment at the Imputed Interest Rate. The “Imputed Interest Rate” with respect to the Term Trust Certificates is the annual pre-tax interest rate which the holders of Term Trust Certificates applied, at the time of initial issuance of the Term Trust Certificates, as the discount rate to the stream of cash flows represented by payments to be made during the Term Interest under the Lease.</p>
    <p>Assuming an Imputed Interest Rate of 7.24%, the amount of the proceeds to be received upon a Total Condemnation will be generally equal to or nominally in excess of the then-applicable Prepayment Amount through the period ending Dec. 31, 1999. As a result, in the event of a Total Condemnation during such period, holders of Certificates will not receive a return of their initial investment and could incur a significant loss. While the Seller believes that the probability of a Total Condemnation under the Lease is remote, the occurrence of such an event during the early years of the underlying Term Interest could have a material adverse effect upon the holders of Certificates.</p>
    <p>No Operating History</p>
    <p>The Remainder Trust is newly formed and has no operating history.</p>
    <p>Achievement of Objectives</p>
    <p>There can be no assurance that any or all of the principal objectives of the Remainder Trust as set forth under “Business” can be achieved. Any reference to the objectives of the Seller should not be interpreted as a guarantee, representation or warranty.</p>
    <p>Arbitrary Offering Price</p>
    <p>The offering price of the Certificates offered hereby has been arbitrarily determined by the Seller based primarily upon the estimated cost of acquiring the LURE® Interest, the expenses to be paid as a result of this offering, the cost of organizing the Remainder Trust and other matters. The offering price of the Certificates is no indication of their value or the value of the assets which the Remainder Trust will acquire. No assurance is or can be given that any Certificates, if transferable, could be sold for the offering price or for any amount.</p>
    <p>Lack of Liquidity</p>
    <p>There is no established market for the Certificates and the Seller does not anticipate that any market will develop. Consequently, holders may not be able to liquidate their investment in the event of an emergency or for other reasons. Purchase of a Certificate is therefore suitable only for persons who have no need for liquidity with respect to their investment and who are able to bear the economic risks of their investments for an unlimited period of time.</p>
    <p>Securities Law Aspects</p>
    <p>The Certificates have not been registered under the Act or the Illinois Securities Act in reliance upon certain exemptions from registration thereunder. The Seller believes that the offering presently qualifies and, where appropriate, will continue to qualify under the exemptions. However, since the availability of certain of these exemptions is based upon subjective factors, and in some instances the criteria for exemption are subject to reinterpretation by state or federal regulatory agencies and courts, there can be no assurance that such exemptions will be determined to be available.</p>
    <p>THE LURE® INTEREST</p>
    <p>Background</p>
    <p>Academics and real estate finance specialists have generally accepted the notion that commercial real estate leased on a so-called “bondable” basis (i.e., obligating the tenant to pay, among other things, all maintenance, insurance and tax expenses and to assume certain condemnation, environmental and structural repair risks) to credit-worthy tenants can be divided conceptually into two components: a bond-equivalent component and a “residual”, or equity, component. The bond-equivalent component represents the value on a net present value basis of the expected payments under the bondable lease, discounted at a rate appropriate to the duration of the lease and the credit-worthiness of the tenant. The bond-equivalent component is comparable in many respects to an intermediate-term, non-callable fixed-income security. In contrast, the “residual”, or equity, component represents the value of commercial real estate after the cash flows generated by the bond-equivalent component have been eliminated—i.e., the net present value of the future right to occupy the real estate upon expiration of the term of the lease. Legally, the bond-equivalent component can be simulated by creating a term-of-years of a duration co-terminous with the term of the triple-net lease, while the equity component in a particular property represents a current, fully vested unencumbered remainder interest in fee simple title to such property. This unencumbered remainder interest will entitle the holder to future possession and control of the property on a debt-free basis following the termination of the underlying term-of-years.</p>
    <p>Over the last four years, principals of Electrum have developed proprietary financial software to implement this debt/equity conceptual model of commercial real estate value. Electrum utilizes a proprietary pricing model comparable to that used to price and value fixed income securities to appropriately price and value both the bond-equivalent component of a commercial real estate asset and the residual equity component of that asset.</p>
    <p>Investment Characteristics of LURE® Interest</p>
    <p>The LURE® Interest to be acquired by the Remainder Trust is similar in many respects to a zero-coupon security, with payment “at maturity” occurring in 2009 at the expiration of the underlying term-of-years in the form of unencumbered fee simple absolute title to the Property. However, unlike the holder of a zero-coupon debt security, holders of Certificates, as beneficiaries of the Remainder Trust, will not be subject to taxation of imputed interest on, or appreciation of, the LURE® Interest during the underlying term-of-years.</p>
    <p>In effecting the acquisition of the entire fee simple interest in the Property pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Seller caused the previous owner of the Property to “split” the fee simple ownership of the Property by simultaneously (a) conveying to the Term Trust a term-of-years real property interest in the Property, which term-of-years interest will terminate on Dec. 31, 2009 and (b) conveying to the Remainder Trust the LURE® Interest, which will entitle the holders of Certificates, as beneficiaries of the Remainder Trust, upon termination of the Term Interest on Dec. 31, 2009, to a fee simple interest in the Property.</p>
    <p>The Seller has established the Remainder Trust by selling and assigning the LURE® Interest to the Remainder Trust in exchange for $2.15 million. Prior to such sale and assignment, the Remainder Trust had no assets or obligations or any operating history. The Remainder Trust will not engage in any activity other than acquiring and holding the LURE Interest and issuing the Certificates.</p>
    <p>During the term-of-years expiring in 2009, the Term Trust will receive all net rental cash flow from the Property and will be responsible for all expenditures associated with conservation of the investment value of the Property, including maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc. The Remainder Trust as holder of the LURE® Interest will receive no financial benefits during the term-of-years and, correspondingly, will not be subject to any property-related expenditures during this period. The Term Trust will not have any financial claims against the Remainder Trust, as holder of the corresponding LURE® Interest, or any claims to any of the economic benefits to be derived from the Property following expiration of the term-of-years in 2009. Accordingly, upon the expiration of the term-of-years in 2009, the Remainder Trust, as holder of the LURE® Interest, will be entitled, free of any underlying indebtedness, to exclusive possession and control of the Property.</p>
    <p>To illustrate the investment characteristics of the LURE® Interest, set forth below is an example of hypothetical investment returns to the Remainder Trust, assuming the LURE® Interest is held by the Remainder Trust until expiration of the underlying term-of-years in 2009:</p>
    <p>Property Purchase Price: $10,455,000.</p>
    <p>Valuation of Term-of Years and LURE® Interest: Assume that the bond-equivalent component entitled to receive the net cash flows from the Lease is sold to an institutional investor or investors. The price of the LURE® Interest to the Remainder Trust equals the difference between the market value of the Property (plus fees and expenses associated with the separation), less the cost of the bond-equivalent component, or $2.15 million.</p>
    <p>Investment Return: If the LURE® Interest is held to maturity (i.e., until Dec. 31, 2009), the investment return on the LURE® Interest is determined by the value of the Property at the end of the term-of-years:</p>
    <p>Assuming a 25% decline in the Property's market value over the investment period (to $7,841,250), then the LURE® Interest will yield a compound annual return of 9.22% and a total return of 264.71%.</p>
    <p>Assuming no change in the Property's value over the investment period, then the LURE® Interest will yield a compound annual return of 11.38% and a total return of 386.28%.</p>
    <p>Assuming a 25% increase in the Property's market value over the investment period (to $13,068,750), the LURE® Interest will yield a compound annual return of 13.08% per annum and a total return of 507.85%.</p>
    <p>An investment in Certificates will be subject to many of the risks generally associated with the ownership of unleveraged real property, including the possibility of adverse changes in national and local economic conditions; changes in rates of inflation; changes in the real estate investment climate; adverse changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics; adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; natural disasters, including earthquakes and other factors which are beyond the control of the Seller.</p>
    <p>THE REMAINDER TRUST</p>
    <p>Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement governing the terms of the Remainder Trust. The description and summaries of the Trust Agreement hereinafter set forth do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and reference is made to the Trust Agreement for the complete details of all terms and conditions. All statements herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Trust Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit C to this Confidential Private Placement Memorandum.</p>
    <p>The Certificates</p>
    <p>The Certificates will be issued only in fully registered form. The Certificates will be issued in denominations of $50,000 and integral multiples thereof.</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions on which the Trustee shall hold the LURE® Interest, both during the term-of-years held by the Term Trust, and following the termination of the Term Trust upon the expiration of the term-of-years expiring in 2009. The Trust Agreement establishes the duties and obligations of the Trustee regarding the collection and distribution of funds and other administrative responsibilities relating to the LURE® Interest. The Trust Agreement assigns the Trustee the general responsibilities accorded financial fiduciaries, reserving other specified services to the beneficiaries as appropriate.</p>
    <p>Flow Of Funds</p>
    <p>The terms of the Trust Agreement require the Trustee to establish the Administration Account into which the Trustee is required to deposit all monies received for the benefit of the Certificateholders on account of any rent or other payments received in respect of the Property. The Administration Account must be established at a bank or other financial institution: (i) authorized pursuant to applicable laws to exercise corporate trust powers with respect to the LURE® Interest; (ii) having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities; and (iii) having (or having a parent which has) a long term unsecured debt rating of at least BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation and at least Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. On the 15th day of each month following the establishment of the Administration Account, the Trustee is directed to distribute to the Certificateholders as of the immediately preceding Record Date the amount of Distributable Funds then on deposit in the Administration Account. Distributable Funds includes the total balance of funds then in the Administration Account less the sum of: (i) $25,000; plus (ii) the amount of all Reimbursable Costs incurred by the Trustee for which the Trustee has not previously been reimbursed; plus (iii) the amount of all Reimbursable Costs reasonably anticipated by the Trustee to be incurred prior to the next succeeding Distribution Date. The Trustee has a priority right to reimbursement of Reimbursable Costs incurred pursuant to the Trust Agreement from Collections received by the Trustee and, if necessary, from the Trust Estate. On the Final Distribution Date, the Distributable Funds shall be calculated without regard to clauses (i) and (iii) above.</p>
    <p>For purposes of calculating Distributable Funds, “Reimbursable Costs” include all fees, expenses, costs or other charges incurred in good faith by the Trustee in the performance of its duties and obligations under the Agreement. By way of example, Reimbursable Costs would include all fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with the engagement by the Trustee of Qualified Real Estate Consultants and counsel to advise the Trustee regarding the discharge by the Trustee of its obligations under Section 6.2 of the Trust Agreement upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Casualty Loss Termination or Total Condemnation.</p>
    <p>General Duties Of Trustee</p>
    <p>The Trustee shall generally have only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement relating to the administration of the Remainder Trust in the interest of the Certificateholders and is required to discharge such duties in accordance with its general obligations of loyalty and prudence as Trustee. The Trustee shall receive on behalf of the Certificateholders all Collections with respect to the Property and shall deposit the same into the Administration Account for monthly distribution in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement. Each monthly distribution shall be accompanied by a statement itemizing Collections received, Reimbursable Costs incurred and the calculation of the amount of such distribution. In addition, the Trustee shall be required to give and receive all notices in respect of the Trust Estate as more specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>Specific Duties Of Trustee</p>
    <p>Actions to Be Taken By Trustee Upon Event of Default Under Lease. The Trustee is required generally to monitor the performance of the Tenant under the Lease and to give and receive all notices required or permitted to be given or received by the Trustee under the Administration Agreement. If an Event of Default shall occur under the Lease, the Trustee must give notice thereof to the holders of Certificates and proceed upon the further written instruction of the holders of Certificates with respect to such Event of Default. Because of the nature of the LURE® Interest, during the term-of-years owned by the Term Trust, the Trustee has limited rights with respect to actions involving the Property. Such rights will generally be limited to the Trustee's ability to commence an action against the Term Trustee seeking to prevent waste regarding the Property through the failure of the Term Trustee to enforce the terms of the Lease or to otherwise take such actions as are reasonably necessary with respect to the preservation of the Property.</p>
    <p>If so directed in writing by the holders of Certificates, the Trustee shall initiate such actions, including the commencement of legal proceedings, as shall in the reasonable judgment of counsel retained by the Trustee for such purpose be necessary or appropriate to preserve the Trust Property. All costs and expenses incurred by the Remainder Trustee in so acting shall constitute Reimbursable Costs. The Trustee shall not be required to take any action, incur any expense or advance any funds unless: (i) there shall then be on deposit in the Administration Account funds sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, to provide for reimbursement of all Reimbursable Costs incurred or to be incurred by the Trustee in acting at the direction of the holders of Certificates; or (ii) the Trustee shall have received assurances from the holders of Certificates as to the source and manner for the reimbursement of such Reimbursable Costs reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (clauses (i) and (ii) above being hereinafter referred to as the “Reimbursement Conditions”). If the Trustee shall seek such assurances and the holders of Certificates shall fail or refuse to provide the same within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor by the Trustee, such failure or refusal shall constitute a Termination Event and require the Trustee to cause the Trust Property to be sold at auction to the highest bidder. The holders of Certificates will not be permitted to bid at such auction.</p>
    <p>Casualty Loss; Casualty Loss Termination. In the event of a Casualty Loss affecting the Property involving a loss in excess of $100,000, the Trustee is required to give written notice to the holders of Certificates. If such Casualty Loss results in a Casualty Loss Termination of the Lease, the Trustee shall so notify the holders of Certificates and await the further written instructions of the holders of Certificates. If the holders of Certificates shall direct the Trustee with respect to the taking of any actions in response to such Casualty Loss Termination, all fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Trustee in connection therewith shall be Reimbursable Costs. The Trustee shall have no obligation to take any such actions unless the Reimbursement Conditions are then met. For purposes of the Trust Agreement, a “Casualty Loss” is any loss or damage suffered or incurred with respect to the Property arising out of any fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake, act of God, war, strike or other casualty. A “Casualty Loss Termination” means any termination of the Lease resulting from the occurrence of a Casualty Loss. See “Exhibit D—SUMMARY OF LEASE PROVISIONS—Fire and Other Casualty.”</p>
    <p>Condemnation. In the event of a Partial Condemnation affecting the Property, the Trustee shall give written notice thereof to the holders of Certificate and await the instructions of the holders of Certificate. If, after restoration of the Property pursuant to the terms of the Lease, there remains any unapplied balance of the Condemnation Award received in respect of such Partial Condemnation, such unapplied balance is required by the terms of the Term Trust to be paid to the Trustee, who in turn shall deposit the same in the Administration Account for distribution in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>If there shall occur a Total Condemnation, the Trustee shall give notice thereof to the holders of Certificates and proceed in accordance with the written instructions thereof; provided that if the holders of Certificates fail to direct the Trustee as to the taking or failing to take of any action in connection with such Total Condemnation, the Trustee shall retain a Qualified Real Estate Consultant with respect to the Total Condemnation and shall proceed in the manner determined by the Qualified Real Estate Consultant to be in the best interests of the holders of Certificates. All legal fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee in so acting shall be Reimbursable Costs.</p>
    <p>For purposes of the Trust Agreement, a “Partial Condemnation” means (i) any taking by condemnation or other eminent domain proceeding pursuant to any law or (ii) temporary requisition of the Property or any part thereof by any governmental authority after the occurrence of which the Lease shall remain in full force and effect. A “Total Condemnation” means any condemnation after the occurrence of which the Lease shall not remain in full force and effect. A “Qualified Real Estate Consultant” means the commercial loan servicing, property or asset management group which is an affiliate of the Trustee, if such group is affiliated with the Trustee, or any Person who: (i) has not less than 10 years of experience as a professional asset or property manager and is licensed (if required) to perform such services in the locale of the property; (ii) then has under management a portfolio of commercial and office properties containing in the aggregate not less than 2 million square feet or with an aggregate fair market value of not less than $20 million; and (iii) then has not fewer than 20 employees directly engaged in the provision of asset or property management services.</p>
    <p>Termination Of Trust Agreement</p>
    <p>The Trust shall terminate upon the final distribution of all monies or other property or proceeds of the Trust Estate following the occurrence of a Termination Event or a sale of the Trust Estate pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Trust Agreement. A “Termination Event” shall have occurred upon the happening of any of the following: (i) a Total Condemnation; (ii) the failure of the holders of Certificates to give the financial assurances or indemnity required pursuant to Sections 6.2(d) or (g) of the Trust Agreement with respect to actions to be taken by the Trustee following an Event of Default or Casualty Loss Termination; (iii) the expiration of ten (10) years from the date on which the Term Trust shall have terminated; or (iv) following the date on which the Term Trust shall have terminated, the receipt by the Trustee of a written direction from all holders of Certificates directing the Trustee to terminate the Trust and containing a release of all claims of any nature whatsoever of such holders of Certificates against the Term Trustee and the beneficial owners of any interest in the Term Trust arising from or in connection with the Term Trustee's ownership of the Term Interest in the Property, or the use, operation or maintenance of the Property during the term of the Term Trust.</p>
    <p>Section 7.2 of the Trust Agreement requires the Trustee to sell the Trust Estate at auction in the event of the occurrence of a Termination Event pursuant to Sections 6.2(d) or (g) of the Trust Agreement. Such sale shall take place pursuant to an auction to be held in a manner and at the direction of an auctioneer as recommended by a Qualified Real Estate Consultant retained by the Trustee with respect to conduct of such auction. The holders of Certificates will not be permitted to bid at such auction. All reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee, including, without limitation, fees and expenses incurred by counsel retained by the Trustee in connection with such auction shall be Reimbursable Costs. The proceeds of such auction shall be deposited into the Administration Account, and applied in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>Amendments</p>
    <p>For so long as Elizabeth McKeever Ross is the sole Certificateholder, she may cause the Trust Agreement to be amended at any time by a written instrument effecting such amendment, provided that any amendment which materially modifies the scope or nature of the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall not be effective unless consented to by the Trustee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. It is contemplated that upon the sale by K. C. ABBE® Holdings, L.L.C. of the beneficial interest in the Term Trust, the Trust Agreement shall be amended to eliminate such right of amendment by Elizabeth McKeever Ross and to reflect the designation of a successor trustee to The First National Bank of Chicago. The Trust Agreement may be amended by the Trustee with the consent of the holders of 51% or more of the Voting Interests only for the limited purposes of (i) curing any ambiguity; (ii) correcting or supplementing any provision in the Trust Agreement that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision; (iii) as shall be required in connection with the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee; or (iv) and as may be required to facilitate the administration of the Remainder Trust under the Trust Agreement by more than one Trustee pursuant to Article 6 of the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement may not otherwise be amended.</p>
    <p>The Trustee</p>
    <p>The First National Bank of Chicago will serve as Trustee. The Trustee, in its individual capacity or otherwise, and any of its affiliates, may hold Certificates in their own name or as pledgee. In addition, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of certain jurisdictions, the Trustee will have the power to appoint co-trustees or separate trustees of all or any part of the Remainder Trust.

    <p>The Trustee may resign at any time, in which event the Certificateholders may appoint a successor trustee. The Certificateholders may also remove the Trustee if the Trustee ceases to be eligible to serve, becomes legally unable to act, is adjudged insolvent or is placed in receivership or similar proceedings.</p>
    <p>The Trust Agreement provides that the fees and expenses of the Trustee constitute Reimbursable Costs, reimbursable from funds on deposit in the Administration Account created pursuant to the Trust Agreement.</p>

    <p>THE BUILDING AND THE PROPERTY</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <p>The Seller has purchased for $10,445,000 the entire fee simple interest in the Kansas City Life Insurance Office Building, a 94,149 square foot office building (the “Building”) located at 4900 Oak Street in the Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City, Mo. The Building was constructed in 1960 and substantial renovations were completed on the Building in 1992. Pursuant to the terms of a so-called “bondable” lease, the term of which expires in 2009, the Building is 100% leased to Old American Life Insurance Company (the “Tenant”). The obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Kansas City Life Insurance Company (the “Lease Guarantor”), and the Tenant has subleased a portion of the Building to The Ewing Kauffman Foundation (the “Subtenant”). The sublease expires in 1997, but the Subtenant has options to extend.</p>
    <p>The Building</p>
    <p>The Building is a three-story office building containing 94,149 square feet of rentable area, of which approximately 27,780 square feet comprise a basement containing a mailroom, print shop, cafeteria, boiler room and restrooms. A sprinklered garage containing 76,341 square feet adjoins and is connected to the structure and provides sheltered parking for 250 vehicles. The Building was constructed in 1960, and substantial renovations were completed in 1992. The Building is of steel beam and column construction, with exterior walls of concrete panels, brick, decorative marble and glass. The Building's heating/ventilating/air conditioning system consists of hot and cold deck systems which utilize two gas hot water heaters, each with 37,000,000 BTUs of heating capacity, together with two 200 ton Carrier centrifugal chillers. The Seller believes that the Building is in very good physical condition.</p>
    <p>The Property</p>
    <p>The Building and its adjoining garage are located approximately 4.5 miles south of downtown Kansas City on a 2.091 acre parcel in an area commonly referred to as the Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City, Mo. The Property, situated at the intersection of Volker Boulevard and Oak Street, is located directly across from the campus of the University of Missouri at Kansas City and is surrounded by several other office buildings, medical research facilities and high-quality residential developments. Access to the Property site is along both Volker Boulevard and Oak Street, with a circular drive running to the Building's front entrance off of Oak Street.</p>
    <p>The Country Club Plaza district of Kansas City is anchored by the Country Club Plaza retail development, which was established in the 1920's as the country's first “shopping center.” Country Club Plaza remains one of the most prestigious retail locations in Kansas City, attracting quality tenants including Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany, Brooks Brothers, Dillard's and Ralph Lauren/Polo, among others. Country Club Plaza is located less than one mile from the Property. The area surrounding the Property is fully developed, made up of approximately 45% single family residential, 15% institutional, 15% commercial retail, 15% multi-family residential and 10% commercial office buildings.</p>
    <p>The Kansas City, Missouri/Kansas metropolitan area is the 28th largest in the United States, with a population in excess of 1.5 million. The economy of the region is diversified, with the manufacturing, wholesale/retail services and government sectors each contributing in excess of 15% of the non-agricultural jobs in the region. Transportation, finance, insurance and real estate are also substantial contributors to the region's economy.</p>
    <p>THE LEASE</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the terms of a Lease, dated Dec. 29, 1989 and as subsequently amended (the “Lease”), Old American Life Insurance Company (the “Tenant”) has leased the Building for an initial term expiring on Dec. 31, 2009. The Lease is a so-called “triple net” lease, with the Tenant assuming substantially all obligations for maintenance, insurance and utilities and certain other environmental, structural repair and condemnation risks. Attached hereto as Exhibit D is a summary of the terms of the Lease.</p>
    <p>THE LEASE GUARANTOR</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the terms of a Guaranty, dated as of Nov. 13, 1991 (the “Guaranty”), from Kansas City Life Insurance Company (the “Lease Guarantor”), the obligations of the Tenant under the Lease have been unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Lease Guarantor. The Tenant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Lease Guarantor.</p>
    <p>Kansas City Life Insurance Company (the “Lease Guarantor”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries issue and market a full line of universal life, term and traditional whole life insurance and accident and health insurance products. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, the Lease Guarantor had consolidated revenues in the amount of $393.5 million, pre-tax income of $56.9 million and net income of $37.4 million. At Dec. 31, 1994, the Lease Guarantor had total assets of $2.7 billion and total stockholders' equity of $343.7 million.</p>

    <p>FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS</p>
    <p>PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR PERSONAL TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING CERTIFICATES.</p>
    <p>The following is a summary of the material federal income tax consequences to holders of Certificates. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and upon rules and regulations promulgated under the Code and existing interpretations thereof, any of which could be changed at any time, by legislation or otherwise. Any of such changes may or may not be retroactive with respect to transactions consummated prior to the date such changes are announced. The discussion below does not purport to address federal income tax consequences applicable to particular categories of investors, some of which (e.g., banks, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies or foreign investors) may be subject to special rules.</p>
    <p>In the opinion of Kirkland &amp; Ellis, special tax counsel to the Seller, the Remainder Trust will be classified for Federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Accordingly, each holder of a Certificate will be subject to Federal income taxation as if it owned directly its proportionate interest in each asset owned by the Trust. Each holder of Certificates will be required to report on its federal income tax return its pro rata share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit from the property held in the Remainder Trust, in accordance with such holder's method of accounting. In general, until the expiration in 2009 of the underlying Term Interest in the Property, the Remainder Trust is not expected to recognize any income or incur any expenses with respect to the LURE® Interest. Any increase or decrease in the fair market value of a Certificate will not give rise to recognizable gain or loss, respectively, to a holder for Federal income tax purposes, until the earlier of such holder's sale of his Certificate or the Remainder Trust's sale of the LURE® Interest.</p>
    <p>A holder that sells or exchanges a Certificate should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between its adjusted tax basis in the Certificate and the amount realized upon such sale or exchange. If the holder held such Certificate as a capital asset, any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Certificate was held for more than one year. Any long-term capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of a Certificate will be taxable under current law to corporate taxpayers at the rates applicable to ordinary income, and to individual taxpayers at a maximum marginal rate of 28%. Any capital losses realized generally will be deductible by a corporate taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains and by an individual taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains plus $3,000 of other income.</p>
    <p>REPORTS OF CERTIFICATEHOLDERS</p>
    <p>The Trustee will furnish to each holder of Certificates certain reports, statements and tax information, as set forth in the Trust Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit C, including such information necessary in the preparation of the Certificateholders' federal income tax returns.</p>
    <p>ADDITIONAL INQUIRIES</p>
    <p>The Seller will make every effort to furnish to any qualified prospective investor or his purchaser representative any additional information, or opportunity for inquiry, concerning the terms and conditions of this offering, including information requested to verify the accuracy of the information contained in this Confidential Private Placement Memorandum or otherwise furnished the prospective investor or his purchaser representative.</p>
    <p>LEGAL MATTERS</p>
    <p>The legality of the Certificates offered hereby will be passed upon for the Seller by Gardner, Carton &amp; Douglas, Chicago, Ill. Gardner, Carton &amp; Douglas has served as special securities counsel to the Seller and certain affiliates of the Seller. Certain tax matters relating to the Remainder Trust, the Certificates and the LURE® Interest will be passed upon for the Seller by Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Chicago, Ill.</p>

    <p>K.C. LURE® TRUST 1995-1</p>
    <p>$2,150,000 Certificates</p>
    <p>Scribcor, Inc.</p>
    <p>400 North Michigan Avenue</p>
    <p>Chicago, Ill. 60611</p>
    <p>Re: K. C. LURE® Trust 1995-1</p>
    <p>Gentlemen:</p>
    <p>In connection with the subscription of the undersigned to purchase all or a portion of $2,150,000 aggregate of leveraged unencumbered real estate (LURE(®) certificates (the “Certificates”) evidencing undivided fractional interests in K.C. LURE® Trust 1995-1, a special purpose grantor trust (the “Remainder Trust”), the undersigned is hereby furnishing Scribcor, Inc., the grantor of the Remainder Trust (the “Seller”), the information set forth herein and makes the representations and warranties set forth herein, to indicate whether the undersigned is a suitable purchaser of Certificates. As a condition precedent to investing in the Certificates, the undersigned hereby represents, warrants, covenants and agrees as follows:</p>
    <p>1. If the undersigned has retained a purchaser representative, the undersigned acknowledges receipt of a statement from such purchaser representative relating to any past or future relationships between such purchaser representative and the Seller or their respective affiliates. (Note: The purchaser representative, if any, must sign the Purchaser Representative Acknowledgment attached hereto.)</p>
    <p>2. The undersigned acknowledges that he and his purchaser representative, if any, have received and carefully reviewed a copy of the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, including any supplements thereto (the “Offering Memorandum”), dated May 4, 1995, relating to the Certificates, and all exhibits thereto, and understands the Certificates will be offered to others on the terms and in the manner described in the Offering Memorandum. The undersigned hereby subscribes to purchase the aggregate amount of Certificates set forth below pursuant to the terms of the Offering Memorandum and hereby tenders his initial subscription. The undersigned acknowledges that he shall have no right to withdraw this subscription after the acceptance thereof by the Seller and that the Seller may reject any subscription for any reason without liability therefor.</p>
    <p>2. The undersigned recognizes that he will be personally liable for the full amount of this subscription.</p>
    <p>3. The undersigned is aware that no federal or state regulatory agency has made any findings or determination as to the fairness for public or private investment, nor any recommendation or endorsement, of an investment in Certificates.</p>
    <p>4. The undersigned believes that, by reason of his knowledge and experience in financial and business matters in general, and in real estate investments in particular (and/or such knowledge and experience of the undersigned's purchaser representative, if any), he is capable of evaluating the risks and merits of an investment in Certificates. The undersigned recognizes the speculative nature and the risk of loss associated with an investment in Certificates and that he may suffer a complete loss of his investment. The undersigned has an overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable and not disproportionate to his net worth, and his investment in Certificates will not cause such overall commitment to become excessive. The amount and nature of the undersigned's investment in Certificates is suitable and consistent with his investment program and his financial situation enables him to bear the risks of this investment. The undersigned represents that he has adequate means of providing for his current needs and possible personal contingencies and that his investment in Certificates will not excess 20% of his net worth (exclusive of principal residence, furnishings and automobiles).</p>
    <p>5. The undersigned confirms that he understands, and has fully considered for purposes of this investment, the matters discussed under the caption “Risk Factors and Other Considerations” in the Offering Memorandum and that (i) the Remainder Trust has been recently formed and has no financial or operating history; (ii) an investment in Certificates involves a significant degree of risk by the undersigned; and (iii) it may be difficult or impossible for him to liquidate his investment in Certificates in case of an emergency or for any other reason.</p>
    <p>6. The undersigned confirms that in making his decision to invest in Certificates he has relied upon independent investigations made by him or his purchaser representative or other advisors, including his own professional tax, financial and other advisors, and that he and such representatives have been given the opportunity to examine all documents and to ask questions of, and to receive answers from the Seller concerning the terms and conditions of the offering or any other matter set forth in the Offering Memorandum, and to obtain any additional information, to the extent the Seller possesses such information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense, necessary to verify the accuracy of the information set forth in the Offering Memorandum, and that no representations have been made to him and no offering materials have been furnished to him concerning Certificates, its business or prospects or other matters, except as set forth in the Offering Memorandum.</p>
    <p>7. The undersigned understands that Certificates are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), and, in particular, Regulation D thereunder, and warrants and represents his investment is being made solely for his own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a view to or for the resale, distribution, subdivision or fractionalization thereof; the undersigned understands and acknowledges that the Certificates are being offered and will be sold solely to “accredited investors,” as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D; the undersigned has no agreement or other arrangement, formal or informal, with any person to sell, transfer or pledge all or any part of his investment in Certificates or which would guarantee the undersigned any profit or protect the undersigned against any loss with respect to such investment; the undersigned has no plans to enter into any such agreement or arrangement, and, consequently, he must bear the economic risk of the investment for an indefinite period of time because the investment cannot be resold or otherwise transferred unless subsequently registered under the Act (which the Seller is not obligated to do), or an exemption from such registration is available.</p>
    <p>8. The undersigned confirms that he and his purchaser representative, if any, understand the nature of the investment that the Remainder Trust intends to make, and that he and his purchaser representative, if any, are thoroughly familiar with typical organizational, operational, financial and other relevant characteristics of such investments and the economic benefits and operational, regulatory and other risks associated with such investments.</p>
    <p>9. The undersigned is aware that the Seller has been and is relying upon the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement in part in determining whether the offering meets the conditions specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the exemption from registration provided by the Act.</p>
    <p>10. All of the information which the undersigned has furnished the Seller herein or previously with respect to the undersigned's financial position and business experience is correct and complete as of the date of this Agreement, and, if there should be any material change in such information prior to the termination of the offering period, the undersigned immediately will furnish such revised or corrected information to the Seller. The undersigned agrees that the foregoing representations and warranties shall survive his purchase of Certificates as well as any acceptance or rejection of a subscription for an investment in Certificates.</p>
    <p>11. The undersigned acknowledges that he understands the meaning and legal consequences of the representations and warranties set forth herein, and he agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against any and all claims, actions, demands, losses, costs, expenses (including attorney's fees), and damages that might result from any claim or legal proceeding relating to or arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty of the undersigned contained in this Agreement.</p>
    <p>INVESTORS MUST PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION</p>
    <p>12. The name and address of the undersigned's purchaser representative, if any, are as follows:</p>

    <heading>PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT</heading> <p>THIS PURCHASE AND SALES AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is made as of the day of Jan. 13, 1995 (the “Effective Date”) by and between R&amp;S KANSAS CITY ASSOCIATES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Connecticut limited partnership (“Seller”), and SCRIBCOR, INC., an Illinois corporation (“Buyer”).</p>
    <heading>RECITALS</heading> <p>A. Seller owns a parcel of land located at and known as 4900 Oak Street, Kansas City, Mo., which land is more particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the “Land”), and the building (the “Building”), parking area, and other real property improvements located thereon (collectively, the “Real Property”).</p>
    <p>B. The Real Property is subject to that certain Lease Agreement, dated as of Dec. 29, 1989 between Seller, as landlord, and Old American Insurance Company, as tenant (“Tenant”), as amended by a First Amendment to Lease, dated as of Nov. 12, 1991, between Seller and Tenant (as so amended, the “Lease”), which Lease is guaranteed by guaranty, dated as of Nov. 13, 1991, by Kansas City Life Insurance Company (the “Guaranty”).</p>
    <p>C. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Seller desires to sell and Buyer desires to purchase the Real Property.</p>
    <heading>AGREEMENT</heading> <p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, Seller and Buyer agrees as follows:</p>
    <p>1. PURCHASE AND SALE.</p>
    <p>1.1 Property. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Seller hereby agrees to sell, convey and assign to Buyer, and Buyer hereby agrees to purchase and accept from Seller on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 5.1 below) the following (collectively, the “Property”):</p>
    <p>(a) the Real Property, including any and all rights, privileges and easements appurtenant thereto which are owned by Seller;</p>
    <p>(b) all right, title and interest of Seller (if any) in and to the following (the “Personal Property”): (i) all fixtures, equipment and other items of tangible personal property owned by Seller and attached to or located on the Real Property; and (ii) all assignable or transferable intangible property used in connection with the Real Property, including (A) any and all guaranties and warranties pertaining to the Real Property, (B) all rights to obtain utility service in connection with the Real Property, and (C) assignable licenses and other governmental permits and permissions relating to the Real Property; and</p>
    <p>(c) the Lease and the Guaranty, together with all security or other deposits, if any, and other amounts collectible or due after Closing, and all rights and claims of Seller relating thereto from and after the Closing.</p>
    <p>2. PURCHASE PRICE. Buyer shall pay as the total purchase price for the Property (the “Purchase Price”) the sum of Ten Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100ths U.S. Dollars ($10,250,000.00).</p>
    <p>2.1 Letter of Credit. On the Effective Date Buyer shall provide a letter of credit in the form attached as Exhibit G in the amount of Two Hundred Five Thousand and No/100ths U.S. Dollars ($205,000.00), naming Seller as the beneficiary, with an expiration date not earlier than Sep. 1, 1995, which letter of credit shall be issued by a lending institution reasonably satisfactory to Seller (the “Letter of Credit”).</p>
    <p>2.2 Payment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price, plus or minus net prorations, shall be due and payable on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts specified by Seller. Seller shall on the Closing Date return the Letter of Credit to Buyer upon payment of the Purchase price.</p>
    <p>3. TITLE AND SURVEY</p>
    <p>3.1 Survey. Seller has provided Buyer with a Survey dated Dec. 15, 1993, by Shafer, Kline &amp; Warren, P. A., Order Number 226734 (the “Survey”). Seller shall request that the Survey be recertified to Buyer, the Title Insurer (as hereinafter defined), and the Term Trust and Reversion Trust (as those terms are hereinafter defined) as of a date after the date of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>3.2 Title Insurance. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall promptly hereafter apply to the Title Insurer for, and promptly after receipt thereof deliver to Buyer a commitment for an ALTA Owner's Policy (Oct. 17, 1992) of title insurance (the “Commitment”) issued by Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation or another title insurance company reasonably approved by Buyer (the “Title Insurer”) in the amount of the Purchase Price covering title to the Real Property. Buyer agrees to accept title to the Real Property at Closing subject only to the exceptions set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part hereof (the “Permitted Exceptions”). Seller shall request that the Title Company deliver copies of all documents disclosed by Schedule B of the Commitment to Buyer with the Commitment. The Commitment may also include the general exceptions customarily set forth therein; provided, however, that Seller shall execute such affidavits and other documents as are reasonably and customarily required by the Title Insurer in connection with the issuance of an “extended coverage” endorsement over the general exceptions. At Closing, Seller shall pay to the Title Insurer the cost of an owner's title insurance policy (the “Title Policy”) with the following affirmative endorsements (to the extent the Title Insurer is authorized to issue such endorsements): extended coverage, an access endorsement, a survey endorsement, an encroachment endorsement (where encroachments exist), a contiguity endorsement, a separate tax parcel endorsement and a zoning endorsement (form 3.1 including parking), provided that Buyer shall pay the cost of obtaining such zoning endorsement up to the amount of $5,000.00, with the additional cost, if any, of such endorsement to be paid by Seller.</p>
    <p>3.3 Title Clearance.</p>
    <p>(a) If, at or prior to the Closing, it shall appear that the Real Property is affected by any outstanding liens, encumbrances, interests or other questions subject to which Buyer is not obligated to take title under the terms of this Agreement, and if such liens, encumbrances, interests or other questions of title may, in the reasonable opinion of Seller, be removed as objections to title within sixty (60) days from the date set forth herein for the Closing, Seller may, but shall not be obligated to (except to the extent required in the immediately succeeding sentence), adjourn the Closing for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days for the purpose of removing such liens, encumbrances, interests or other questions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to require Seller to incur any expense, take any action or commence any proceeding to remove any such liens, encumbrances, interests or other questions or to otherwise render Seller's title marketable or insurable, provided that Seller shall remove at its sole cost and expense any liens which may be removed by the payment of money and arising out of the acts of omissions of Seller. In the event that Seller fails to remove any such liens, encumbrances, interests or other questions or otherwise fails to convey title to the Real Property in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, Buyer may either (1) accept such title as Seller may be able to convey, without any reduction of the Purchase Price or other liability on the part of Seller, provided that Buyer shall be entitled to deduct from the Purchase Price the amount of any lien of an ascertainable amount which Seller was required to have removed pursuant to the foregoing sentence of this Section 3.3(a), or (2) terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller so electing, in which case the sole obligation of Seller shall be to return the Letter of Credit to Buyer, and upon such return this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect, neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder, and the lien, if any, on the Premises which may have been created by the delivery of the Letter of Credit and any other sums or things of value which may be paid on account of this Agreement shall wholly cease.</p>

    <p>14, NON-FOREIGN AFFIDAVIT.</p>
    <p>Seller shall provide Buyer, on or before the Closing Date, with a non-foreign affidavit sufficient in form and substance to relieve Buyer of any and all withholding obligations under federal law, which affidavit shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H. If Seller does not furnish Buyer with said affidavit, or if Buyer has reason to believe that said affidavit would be wholly or partially false if given and so notifies Seller, in writing, on or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall be entitled to withhold up to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price in an escrow account until such time as Seller furnishes Buyer with a qualifying statement from the Internal Revenue Service sufficient to relieve Buyer of any and all withholding obligations under federal law, or until Buyer is required to deliver said funds to the Internal Revenue Service, whichever first occurs.</p>
    <p>15, MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
    <p>15.1 No Waiver. No waiver by any party of the performance or satisfaction of any covenant or condition shall be valid unless in writing and shall not be considered to be a waiver by such party of any other covenant or condition hereunder.</p>
    <p>15.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties regarding the Property and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the same subject. This Agreement may only be modified in writing.</p>
    <p>15.3. Survival. Except for as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, none of the agreements, warranties and representations contained herein shall survive the Closing.</p>
    <p>15.4 Successors. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and to their respective legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.</p>
    <p>15.5 Assignment. Buyer shall have the right to assign its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to two trusts to be established by Buyer one of which trusts shall acquire an estate for years in the Property (the “Term Trust”) and one of which shall acquire the remaining interest of Seller in the Property (the “Reversion Trust”). Seller shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with Buyer in effecting such conveyances, provide that Seller shall not be required to incur any incrementally additional expense in so cooperating. Except as provided above, Buyer shall not have any right to assign, transfer or encumber its rights under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in Seller's sole, absolute and unfettered discretion. Any assignment, transfer or encumbrance by Buyer requiring, but made without, Seller's prior written consent, shall be void ab initio and shall constitute a breach by Buyer of this Agreement entitling Seller to terminate this Agreement and exercise its remedies to immediately draw down the Letter of Credit and retain the proceeds thereof as liquidated damages under Section 12.1 hereof. No assignment, transfer or encumbrance solely in favor of person(s) or entity(ies) in a control relationship with Buyer shall be deemed to violate this Section 14.5. “Control relationship” shall be deemed to mean either (a) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of all of the voting stock of a corporation or fifty percent (50%) or more of all of the legal and equitable interest in a partnership or other business entity or (b) the possession of the power directly or indirectly to direct or cause the direction of management and policy of a corporation, partnership or other business entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, common directors or officers, the contractual right to manage the business affairs of any such corporation, partnership or business entity, or otherwise. Buyer represents, warrants and certifies to Seller that Buyer has not assigned, transferred or encumbered or agreed to assign, transfer or encumber, directly or indirectly, all or any portion of its rights or obligations under this Agreement in violation of this Section.</p>
    <p>15.6 Relationship of the Parties. The parties acknowledge that neither party is an agent for the other party, and that neither party shall or can bind or enter into agreements for the other party.</p>
    <p>15.7 Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations between the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri.</p>
    <p>15.8 Possession: Risk of Loss. Seller shall deliver to Buyer possession of the Property on the Closing Date, subject to Permitted Exceptions and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. All risk of loss or damage with respect to the Property shall pass from Seller to Buyer on the Closing Date.</p>
    <p>15.9 Review by Counsel. The parties acknowledge that each party and its counsel have reviewed and approved this Agreement, and the parties hereby agree that the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any amendments or exhibits hereto.</p>
    <p>15.10 Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason by either party, Buyer shall have the obligation to return to Seller all documents and copies thereof (including the survey, if any) and any other information or documentation prepared by any third party in conjunction with Buyer's inspections of the Property. Seller shall not have any obligation to return the Letter of Credit to Buyer, upon any termination of this Agreement by Buyer, until the documents and copies thereof (including the survey, if any) and other information have been return to Seller.</p>
    <p>15.11 Exhibits. The Exhibits attached hereto form a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
    <p>16. CONDITION PRECEDENT.</p>
    <p>Buyer's obligations under this Agreement shall be conditioned upon Buyer's completion on or before 5:00 p.m. EST on Thursday, Jan. 19, 1995 of an inspection of the Real Property. If Buyer shall effectively notify Seller in writing within said period that the Real Property is not in a condition reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, then Buyer may elect by such notice to terminate this Agreement, in which event neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder and the Letter of Credit shall be returned to Buyer. In the absence of such effective notice, this condition shall be deemed waived by Buyer.</p>
    <p>17. COUNTERPARTS.</p>
    <p>This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which, when taken together, shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall only be effective if a counterpart is signed by both Seller and Buyer.</p>
    <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first set forth above.</p>

    <p>(e) If, at the time of the Closing, the Real Property, or any part thereof, shall be or shall have been affected by an assessment or assessments which are or may become payable in annual installments then for the purpose or this Agreement, no unpaid installments of any such assessment due on or after the date of the Closing shall be deemed to be due and payable or to be liens upon the Premises.</p>

If Buyer does not so terminate this Agreement, or if the taking is as to a non-Material Part of the Real Property, Buyer shall accept all of the Property subject to the taking without a reduction in the Purchase Price and shall receive at Closing an assignment of all of Seller's rights to any condemnation award, subject to Tenant's rights under the Lease. “Material Part” shall mean (i) 10% or more of the area of the Land or the full area of the building and other improvements on the Land or (ii) a part such as gives rise to a right to Tenant to terminate the Lease.</p>
    <p>11.0 COMMISSIONS, EXPENSES AND CREDITS.</p>
    <p>11.1 Payment of the Sale Commission. Buyer and Seller represent and warrant to each other that the party making such warranty dealt with no real estate broker or agent in connection with this transaction except for FDC Management Group, Inc. (the “Broke”) and Buyer shall be solely responsible for the payment of a brokerage fee to the Broker based on a separate agreement between Broker and Buyer. Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and holds Buyer harmless from any and all demands or claims which now or hereafter may be asserted against Buyer for any brokerage fees, commissions or similar types of compensation which may be claimed by any broker which claims to have dealt with Seller or which claims to have been engaged by Seller and all expenses and costs in handling or defending any such demand or claim (including reasonable attorneys fees). Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and holds Seller harmless from any and all demands or claims which now or hereafter may be asserted against Seller for any brokerage fees, commissions or similar types of compensation which may be claimed by any broker which claims to have dealt with Buyer or which claims to have been engaged by Buyer and all expenses and costs in handling or defending any such demand or claim in connection with this transaction (including reasonable attorneys fees).</p>
    <p>12. REMEDIES.</p>
    <p>12.1 Seller's Remedies. If Buyer defaults in its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall entitled to terminate this Agreement and immediately draw down the Letter of Credit and retain the proceeds thereof as liquidated damages. SELLER AND BUYER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SELLER'S DAMAGES WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, AND THAT THE SPECIFIED SUM IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLER'S DAMAGES. SELLER AND BUYER FURTHER AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 12.1 IS INTENDED TO AND DOES LIQUIDATE THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES DUE SELLER, AND SHALL BE SELLER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST BUYER, BOTH AT LAW AND IN EQUITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO A BREACH BY BUYER OF ITS OBLIGATION TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
    <p>12.2 Buyer's Remedies. If Seller defaults in its obligations to sell the Property under this Agreement, (i) buyer may elect to treat this Agreement as terminated, in which case all payments and things of value provided by Buyer hereunder (including the Letter of Credit) shall be returned to Buyer and Buyer may recover as its sole recoverable damages its actual out-of-pocket expenses and costs in connection with this transaction, which damages shall not exceed $75,000.00 in any event, or (ii) Buyer may elect to treat this Agreement as being in full force and effect, and Buyer shall have the right to an action for specific performance, which action shall seek enforcement of this Agreement strictly in accordance with its terms. SELLER AND BUYER FURTHER AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 12.2 IS INTENDED TO AND DOES LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES DUE BUYER AND THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO BUYER, AND SHALL BE BUYER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST SELLER, BOTH AT LAW AND IN EQUITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO A BREACH BY SELLER OF ITS OBLIGATION TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
    <p>13. NOTICES.</p>
    <p>All notices, requests or demands to a party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be effective (i) when delivered personally, (ii) when received by overnight courier service or facsimile telecommunication (provided that a copy of such notice, request or demand is deposited into the United States mail within one (1) business day of the facsimile transmission), or (iii) three (3) days after being deposited into the United States mail (sent certified or registered, return receipt requested), in each case addressed as follows (or to such other address as Buyer or Seller may designate in writing in accordance with this Section 13):</p>

    <p>14, NON-FOREIGN AFFIDAVIT.</p>
    <p>Seller shall provide Buyer, on or before the Closing Date, with a non-foreign affidavit sufficient in form and substance to relieve Buyer of any and all withholding obligations under federal law, which affidavit shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H. If Seller does not furnish Buyer with said affidavit, or if Buyer has reason to believe that said affidavit would be wholly or partially false if given and so notifies Seller, in writing, on or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall be entitled to withhold up to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price in an escrow account until such time as Seller furnishes Buyer with a qualifying statement from the Internal Revenue Service sufficient to relieve Buyer of any and all withholding obligations under federal law, or until Buyer is required to deliver said funds to the Internal Revenue Service, whichever first occurs.</p>
    <p>15, MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
    <p>15.1 No Waiver. No waiver by any party of the performance or satisfaction of any covenant or condition shall be valid unless in writing and shall not be considered to be a waiver by such party of any other covenant or condition hereunder.</p>
    <p>15.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties regarding the Property and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the same subject. This Agreement may only be modified in writing.</p>
    <p>15.3. Survival. Except for as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, none of the agreements, warranties and representations contained herein shall survive the Closing.</p>
    <p>15.4 Successors. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and to their respective legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.</p>
    <p>15.5 Assignment. Buyer shall have the right to assign its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to two trusts to be established by Buyer one of which trusts shall acquire an estate for years in the Property (the “Term Trust”) and one of which shall acquire the remaining interest of Seller in the Property (the “Reversion Trust”). Seller shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with Buyer in effecting such conveyances, provide that Seller shall not be required to incur any incrementally additional expense in so cooperating. Except as provided above, Buyer shall not have any right to assign, transfer or encumber its rights under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in Seller's sole, absolute and unfettered discretion. Any assignment, transfer or encumbrance by Buyer requiring, but made without, Seller's prior written consent, shall be void ab initio and shall constitute a breach by Buyer of this Agreement entitling Seller to terminate this Agreement and exercise its remedies to immediately draw down the Letter of Credit and retain the proceeds thereof as liquidated damages under Section 12.1 hereof. No assignment, transfer or encumbrance solely in favor of person(s) or entity(ies) in a control relationship with Buyer shall be deemed to violate this Section 14.5. “Control relationship” shall be deemed to mean either (a) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of all of the voting stock of a corporation or fifty percent (50%) or more of all of the legal and equitable interest in a partnership or other business entity or (b) the possession of the power directly or indirectly to direct or cause the direction of management and policy of a corporation, partnership or other business entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, common directors or officers, the contractual right to manage the business affairs of any such corporation, partnership or business entity, or otherwise. Buyer represents, warrants and certifies to Seller that Buyer has not assigned, transferred or encumbered or agreed to assign, transfer or encumber, directly or indirectly, all or any portion of its rights or obligations under this Agreement in violation of this Section.</p>
    <p>15.6 Relationship of the Parties. The parties acknowledge that neither party is an agent for the other party, and the neither party shall or can bind or enter into agreements for the other party.</p>
    <p>15.7 Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations between the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri.</p>
    <p>15.8 Possession; Risk of Loss. Seller shall deliver to Buyer possession of the Property on the Closing Date, subject to Permitted Exceptions and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. All risk of loss or damage with respect to the Property shall pass from Seller to Buyer on the Closing Date.</p>
    <p>15.9 Review by Counsel. The parties acknowledge that each party and its counsel have reviewed and approved this Agreement, and the parties hereby agree that the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any amendments or exhibits hereto.</p>
    <p>15.10 Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason by either party, Buyer shall have the obligation to return to Seller all documents and copies thereof (including the survey, if any) any other information or documentation prepared by any third party in conjunction with Buyer's inspections of the Property. Seller shall not have any obligation to return the Letter of Credit to Buyer, upon any termination of this Agreement by Buyer, until the documents and copies thereof (including the survey, if any) and other information have been return to Seller.</p>
    <p>15.11 Exhibits. The Exhibits attached hereto form a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
    <p>16. CONDITION PRECEDENT.</p>
    <p>Buyer's obligations under this Agreement shall be conditioned upon Buyer's completion on or before 5:00 p.m. EST on Thursday, Jan. 19, 1995 of an inspection of the Real Property. If Buyer shall effectively notify Seller in writing within said period that the Real Property is not in a condition reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, then Buyer may elect by such notice to terminate this Agreement, in which event neither part shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder and the Letter of Credit shall be returned to Buyer. In the absence of such effective notice, this condition shall be deemed waived by Buyer.</p>
    <p>17. COUNTERPARTS.</p>
    <p>This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which, when taken together, shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall only be effective if a counterpart is signed by both Seller and Buyer.</p>
    <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first set forth above.</p>

    <p>(a) The Certificates shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A and shall be issued in minimum denominations of $20,000.00 and in integral multiples of $1,000.00 in excess thereof; provided, however, that one Certificate may be issued in a denomination that includes any residual amount. The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or facsimile signature of a Responsible Officer of the Remainder Trustee. Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be duly issued, fully paid and non-assessable beneficial interests in the Trust, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of authentication and delivery of such Certificates.</p>

No Certificate shall entitle its holder to any benefit under this Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose, unless there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A, executed by the Remainder Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Remainder Trustee, by manual signature. Such authentication shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Certificate shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.</p>
    <p>SECTION 3.4 Registration: Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates</p>
    <p>(a) The Trustee shall keep or cause to be kept, at the Corporate Trust Office, a Certificate Register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Remainder Trustee shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and exchanges of Certificates as provided herein; provided, however, that no Certificate may be subdivided upon transfer or exchange such that the denomination of any resulting Certificate is less than $20,000.00.</p>
    <p>(b) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office, the Remainder Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust, authenticate and deliver (or shall cause its authenticating agent to authenticate and deliver), in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates in authorized denominations of a like aggregate amount dated the date of authentication by the Remainder Trustee or any such authenticating agent.</p>
    <p>(c) At the option of a Certificateholder, Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates of authorized denominations of a like aggregate principal amount upon surrender of the Certificates to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Remainder Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust, authenticate and deliver (or shall cause its authenticating agent to authenticate and deliver) one or more Certificates dated the date of authentication by the Remainder Trustee or any such authenticating agent. Such Certificates shall be delivered to the Certificateholder making the exchange.</p>

    <p>(e) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Remainder Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.</p>
    <p>SECTION 3.5 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.</p>
    <p>(a) If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Remainder Trustee, or the Remainder Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) there is delivered to the Remainder Trustee and the Trust such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Remainder Trustee that such Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Remainder Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust and the Remainder Trustee shall authenticate and deliver (or shall cause its authenticating agent to authenticate and deliver), in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a replacement Certificate of a like aggregate principal amount; provided, however, that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, but not a mutilated Certificate, shall have become or within seven days shall be due and payable, then instead of issuing a replacement Certificate the Remainder Trustee may pay such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate when so due or payable.</p>
    <p>(b) If, after the delivery of a replacement Certificate or payment in respect of a destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate pursuant to subsection 3.5(a), a bona fide purchaser of the original Certificate in lieu of which such replacement Certificate was issued presents for payment such original Certificate, the Remainder Trustee shall be entitled to recover such replacement Certificate (or such payment) from the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking such replacement Certificate from such Person to whom such replacement Certificate was delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a bona fide purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Remainder Trustee in connection therewith.</p>
    <p>(c) In connection with the issuance of any replacement Certificate under this Section 3.5, the Remainder Trustee may require the payment by the Certificateholder of such Certificate of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Remainder Trustee and the Certificate Registrar) connected therewith.</p>
    <p>(d) Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.5 in replacement of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional beneficial interest in the Trust, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall be found at any time or be enforced by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Certificates duly issued hereunder.</p>
    <p>(e) The provisions of this Section 3.5 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates.</p>
    <p>SECTION 3.6 Persons Deemed Certificateholders. Prior to due presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Remainder Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall be registered in the Certificate Register as the Certificateholder of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to Article V and for all other purposes whatsoever, and the Remainder Trustee shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.</p>
    <p>SECTION 3.7 Access to List of Certificateholders' Names and Addresses. The Remainder Trustee shall furnish within 15 days after receipt by the Remainder Trustee of a written request therefor from the Seller or any Certificateholder, a list, in such form as the party requesting such list may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Certificateholders as of the most recent Record Date. Each Holder, by receiving and holding a Certificate, shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold the Remainder Trustee accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived.</p>
    <p>SECTION 3.8 Maintenance of Corporate Trust Office. The Remainder Trustee shall maintain at the Corporate Trust Office, an office or offices or agency or agencies where Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Remainder Trustee in respect of the Certificates and the Trust Agreement, Lease and Administration Agreement may be served. The Remainder Trustee initially designates the Corporate Trust Office as its principal office for such purposes. The Remainder Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Seller and to the Certificateholders of any change in the location of the Certificate Register or any such office or agency.</p>

    <p>SECTION 3.10 Restrictions on Transfer.</p>
    <p>(a) The Certificates have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Consequently, the Certificates are not transferable other than pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and satisfaction of certain other provisions specified herein. The Certificates are being offered in a private placement to Elizabeth McKeever Ross. No sale, pledge or other transfer of the Certificates may be made by any Person unless either (i) such sale, pledge or other transfer is made to a “qualified institutional buyer” that executes a certificate, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B or as otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee and the Seller, to the effect that (A) it is “qualified institutional buyer” as defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act, acting for its own account or the accounts of other “qualified institutional buyers” as defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) it is aware that the transferor of such Certificate intends to rely on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act, or (ii) such sale, pledge or other transfer is otherwise made in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in which case (A) the Trustee shall require that both the prospective transferor and the prospective transferee certify to the Trustee and the Seller in writing the facts surrounding such transfer, which certification shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee and the Seller, and (B) the Trustee shall require a written opinion of counsel (which will not be at the expense of the Seller or the Trustee) satisfactory to the Seller and the Trustee to the effect that such transfer will not violate the Securities Act.</p>
    <p>(b) The Certificates may not be acquired by or for the account of (i) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) that is subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA (ii) a plan described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (iii) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of a plan's investment in the entity (each, a “Benefit Plan”). By accepting and holding a Certificate, the Certificateholder shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not a Benefit Plan and, if requested to do so by the Seller or the Trustee, the Certificateholder shall execute and deliver to the Trustee an Undertaking Letter in the form set forth in Exhibit C.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE IV</heading> <heading>ACTIONS BY REMAINDER TRUSTEE</heading> <p>SECTION 4.1 Prior Notice to Certificateholders with Respect to Certain Matters. The Remainder Trustee shall not take any action with respect to the initiation of any claim or lawsuit by the Trust and the compromise of any action, claim or lawsuit brought by or against the Trust until: (i) the Remainder Trustee shall have notified the Certificateholders in writing of the proposed action, such notice to be given at least five (5) business days before the taking of the action described in such notice; and (ii) the Certificateholders shall have failed to notify the Remainder Trustee in writing prior to the 5th business day after such notice is given that such Certificateholders have withheld consent or provided alternative direction.</p>

The Remainder Trustee shall not have the right, power or authority, except upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, to sell, assign, transfer or convey the Trust Estate or any interest therein, and then, only in accordance with and to the extent of the provisions of Section 7.2 hereof. In no event shall the Remainder Trustee have the right, power or authority to: (i) pledge, mortgage, hypothecate, sell, assign, transfer or convey the Trust Estate or any interest therein; or (ii) amend, cause to be amended, or consent to the amendment of the Lease; nor shall the Certificateholders have the right, power or authority to direct the Remainder Trustee to so act, except as explicitly provided in this Agreement.</p>
    <p>SECTION 4.3 Bankruptcy. In no event shall the Remainder Trustee have the right, power or authority to commence a voluntary proceeding in bankruptcy relating to the Trust.</p>
    <p>SECTION 4.4 Restrictions on Certificateholders' Power. The Certificateholders shall not direct the Remainder Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action if such action or inaction would be contrary to any obligation of the Trust or the Remainder Trustee under this Agreement or the Administration Agreement or would be contrary to Section 2.3, nor shall the Remainder Trustee follow any such direction, if given. In no event shall the Certificateholders have the right to direct the Remainder Trustee to: (i) amend the Lease prior to, or with respect to periods of time prior to, the expiration or earlier termination of the Term Trust; or (ii) enter into any Replacement Lease, or, following, or solely with respect to periods of time following, the expiration or earlier termination of the Term Trust, any amendment of the Lease, unless such Replacement Lease or amendment shall provide indemnification to the Remainder Trustee as landlord under such Replacement Lease or amendment on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Remainder Trustee.</p>
    <p>SECTION 4.5 Majority Control. Except as expressly provided herein, any action that may be taken or consent that may be given or withheld by the Certificateholders under this Agreement may be taken, given or withheld by Certificateholders having not less than a majority of the Voting Interests thereof. Except as expressly provided herein, any written notice of the Certificateholders delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be effective if signed by Certificateholders having not less than a majority of the Voting Interests at the time of the delivery of such notice.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE V</heading> <heading>APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS; CERTAIN DUTIES</heading> <p>SECTION 5.1 Establishment of Administration Account.</p>
    <p>(a) If the Remainder Trustee shall receive any payment of money for the benefit of the Certificateholders on account of any Rent or other payments due under the Lease, or the Administration Agreement or otherwise, or if the Remainder Trustee shall be so directed by the Certificateholders pursuant hereto, the Remainder Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, shall establish and maintain in the name of the Remainder Trustee a segregated trust account known as the K.C. LURE Trust 1995-1 Administration Account at a bank or other financial institution: (i) authorized pursuant to applicable laws to exercise corporate trust powers with respect to the Trust Estate; (ii) having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities; and (iii) having (or having a parent which has) a long-term unsecured debt rating of at least BBB by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation (“Administration Account”), bearing an additional designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Certificateholders. If such bank or other financial institution shall publish reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purpose of this Section 5.1, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.</p>
    <p>(b) The Remainder Trustee shall possess all right, title and interest in and to all funds on deposit from time to time in the Administration Account and in all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Administration Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the Remainder Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders.</p>
    <p>SECTION 5.2 Application of Trust Funds.</p>
    <p>(a) On each Distribution Date (including the Final Distribution Date), the Remainder Trustee shall distribute to the Certificateholders, on a pro rata basis, from and only to the extent of amounts then on deposit in the Administration Account, the Distributable Funds calculated as of the Record Date with respect to such Distribution Date.</p>
    <p>(b) On each Distribution Date (including the Final Distribution Date), the Remainder Trustee shall send to each Certificateholder a written statement as of such Distribution Date in substantially the same form as Exhibit D attached hereto setting forth, in reasonable detail, the amount and nature of all Collections received by the Remainder Trustee since the immediately preceding Distribution Date, the amount and calculation of the Distributable Funds as of such Distribution Date, the balance of the Administration Account after distribution of the Distributable Funds on such Distribution Date (and amounts, if any, distributed from the Administration Account to the Remainder Trustee as reimbursement for Reimbursable Costs) as of such Distribution Date, together with any other information reasonable requested in writing by the Certificateholders. The Remainder Trustee is hereby specifically authorized to cause the amount, if any, of such Reimbursable Costs to be distributed from the Administration Account to the Remainder Trustee on each Distribution Date.</p>
    <p>(c) If any withholding tax is imposed on the Trust's payment (or allocations of income) to a Certificateholder, such tax shall reduce the amount otherwise distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance with this Section 5.2. The Remainder Trustee is hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the payment of any tax that is legally owed by the Trust (it being understood that the Remainder Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to contest any such tax in appropriate proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to a distribution (such as a distribution to a non-U.S. Certificateholder), the Remainder Trustee may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with this subsection 5.2(c). If a Certificateholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such withholding tax, the Remainder Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with such Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Remainder Trustee for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred.</p>
    <p>SECTION 5.3 Method of Payment. Subject to subsection 7.1(c), distributions required to be made to Certificateholders on any Distribution Date shall be made to each Certificateholder of record on the immediately preceding Record Date either by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to the account of such Certificateholder at a bank or other entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall have provided to the Remainder Trustee appropriate written instructions at least five (5) business days prior to such Record Date and such Certificateholder's Certificates in the aggregate evidence a denomination of not less than $1,000,000, or, if not, by check mailed to such Certificateholder at the address of such holder appearing in the Certificate Register.</p>
    <p>SECTION 5.4 Accounting and Reports to the Certificateholders, the Internal Revenue Service and Others. The Remainder Trustee shall (a) maintain (or cause to be maintained) the books of the Trust on a calendar year basis on the cash method of accounting, (b) deliver to each Certificateholder, as may be required by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations or otherwise, such information as may be required to enable each Certificateholder to prepare its federal income tax return, (c) file such tax returns relating to the Trust and make such elections as may from time to time be required or appropriate under any applicable state or federal statute or rule or regulation thereunder so as to maintain the Trust's characterization as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes, (d) cause such tax returns to be signed in the manner required by law and (e) collect or cause to be collected any withholding tax as described in and in accordance with subsection 5.2(c) with respect to income or distributions to Certificateholders.</p>
    <p>SECTION 5.5 Signature on Returns. The Remainder Trustee shall sign on behalf of the Trust any and all tax returns of the Trust, unless applicable law requires the Certificateholders to sign such documents, in which case such documents shall be signed by the Certificateholders.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE VI</heading> <heading>THE REMAINDER TRUSTEE</heading> <p>SECTION 6.1 Duties of Remainder Trustee, General.</p>
    <p>(a) The Remainder Trustee undertakes to perform such duties, and only such duties, as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and the Administration Agreement, including the administration of the Trust in the interest of the Certificateholders, subject to the Administration Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Lease. No implied covenants, obligations or duties shall be read into this Agreement.</p>
    <p>(b) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Remainder Trustee may conclusively rely upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Remainder Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement in determining the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions contained therein; provided, however, that the Remainder Trustee shall have examined such certificates or opinions so as to determine compliance of the same with the requirements of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>(c) The Remainder Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:</p>
    <p>this subsection 6.1 (c) shall not limit the effect of subsection 6.1 (a);</p>
    <p>(i) the Remainder Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer unless it is proved that the Remainder Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and</p>
    <p>(ii) the Remainder Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction of the Seller or the Certificateholders received by it pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>(d) Subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.2, monies received by the Remainder Trustee hereunder need not be segregated in any manner except (i) to the extent required by law and (ii) as specifically provided herein, and may be deposited under such general conditions as may be prescribed by law for trust funds, and the Remainder Trustee shall not be obligated to invest such funds or be liable for any interest thereon.</p>
    <p>(e) The Remainder Trustee shall not take any action that (i) is inconsistent with the purposes of the Trust set forth in Section 2.3 or (ii) would, to the Actual Knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Remainder Trustee, result in the Trust's becoming taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. The Certificateholders shall not direct the Remainder Trustee to take action that would violate the provisions of this Section 6.1.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.2 Duties of Remainder Trustee, Specific. In addition to, and not in derogation of, the general duty of the Remainder Trustee to administer the Trust in the interest of the Certificateholders, and to conserve the Trust Estate, the Remainder Trustee shall have the specific duties and obligations set forth below.</p>
    <p>(a) The Remainder Trustee shall at all times prior to the termination of the Trust pursuant to Article VII hereof, take all actions necessary to preserve the existence of the Trust, including, without limitation, the preparation and filing of all instruments or documentation required in connection therewith. In no event shall the Remainder Trustee take any action, or consent to the taking of any action, pursuant to which the Remainder Trustee, the Certificateholders or any other person or party seeks to combine, partition, join or merge the Trust Estate with or into any other interest in the Real Property, it being acknowledged by the Certificateholders, through their acquisition of the Certificates, that no Certificateholder shall have any right, claim or cause of action, whether at law or in equity, against the Remainder Trustee or any other Person, pursuant to which such Certificateholder may seek to have the Trust Estate combined with any other interest in the Real Property, any such right having been hereby fully and irrevocably waived.</p>
    <p>(b) Upon creation of the Trust pursuant hereto, the Remainder Trustee shall receive on behalf of the Certificateholders all Collections. All Collections received by the Trustee shall be deposited into the Administration Account and applied in accordance with the terms hereof.</p>
    <p>(c) The Remainder Trustee shall monitor performance by the Tenant under the Lease only to the extent notified by the Term Trustee pursuant to the Administration Agreement and shall give and receive all notices required or appropriate to be given or received by the Remainder Trustee under the Administration Agreement. If an Event of Default shall occur under the Lease, the Remainder Trustee shall give a Default Notice with respect thereto to the Certificateholders not later than three (3) business days after the date on which the Remainder Trustee first obtains Actual Knowledge of the occurrence of such Event of Default or otherwise receives written notice thereof from the Term Trustee pursuant to the Administration Agreement or otherwise. Each Default Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of the default by the Tenant giving rise to the occurrence of such Event of Default. In furtherance of its duties hereunder, the Remainder Trustee shall obtain from the Term Trustee pursuant to the Administration Agreement copies of the Property Report prepared pursuant to the Servicing Agreement, or, if such Property Reports are no longer being prepared, cause the Real Property to be inspected by a Qualified Real Estate Consultant, not less frequently than two (2) times in each twelve (12) calendar month period during the term of this Trust, for the purpose of determining the Tenant's compliance with the terms of the Lease with respect to the maintenance and preservation of the Real Property. All costs and expenses incurred by the Remainder Trustee in connection with such inspections shall be Reimbursable Costs. If the Remainder Trustee shall determine on the basis of any such Property Report or advice from such Qualified Real Estate Consultant that the Tenant has failed to maintain the Real Property in the manner required by the Lease, the Remainder Trustee shall give written notice thereof to the Term Trustee pursuant to the Administration Agreement and to the Certificateholders, and shall await further instruction from the Certificateholders with respect thereto.</p>
    <p>(d) If so directed in writing by the Certificateholders after the giving of a Default Notice, the Remainder Trustee shall initiate such actions, including, without limitation, the commencement of legal proceedings, as shall, in the reasonable judgment of counsel retained for such purpose by the Remainder Trustee, be necessary or appropriate to preserve the Trust Estate and enforce the rights and remedies of the Remainder Trustee relating to the Trust Estate; and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Remainder Trustee in so doing shall be Reimbursable Costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Remainder Trustee shall not be required to take any action, incur any expenses or advance any funds of the Remainder Trustee under this Section 6.2(d) unless: (i) there shall then be on deposit in the Administration Account funds sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Remainder Trustee, to provide for reimbursement of all Reimbursable Costs incurred or to be incurred by the Remainder Trustee in acting pursuant to this Section 6.2(d); or (ii) the Remainder Trustee shall have received assurances from the Certificateholders (or otherwise) as to the source and manner for the reimbursement of such Reimbursable Costs reasonably satisfactory to the Remainder Trustee. If the Remainder Trustee shall seek such assurances from the Certificateholders and the Certificateholders shall fail or refuse to provide such assurances within fifteen (15) days after receipt of demand therefor, such failure or refusal shall (i) constitute a Termination Event and (ii) excuse further performance by the Remainder Trustee pursuant to this Section.</p>
    <p>(e) In the event of a Casualty Loss affecting the Real Property in connection with which the amount of Casualty Proceeds payable with respect to such Casualty Loss shall be $100,000.00 or more, the Remainder Trustee shall give written notice thereof to the Certificateholders not later than five (5) business days after the Remainder Trustee shall have either received written notice thereof from the Term Trustee pursuant to the Administration Agreement or otherwise obtained Actual Knowledge of such Casualty Loss. Thereafter, the Remainder Trustee shall await the further written instructions of the Certificateholders.</p>
    <p>(f) In the event of a Total Condemnation, the Remainder Trustee shall give written notice thereof to the Certificateholders not later than five (5) business days after the Remainder Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Term Trustee pursuant to the Administration Agreement or shall otherwise have obtained Actual Knowledge of such Total Condemnation. Thereafter the Remainder Trustee shall await the further written instructions of the Certificateholders, and receive the payment of the Remainder Proceeds for the benefit of the Certificateholders. In any circumstances in which the Certificateholders fail to direct the Term Trustee as to the taking (or failing to take) of any action in connection with this Section 6.2(f), the Remainder Trustee shall obtain the written recommendation of counsel and, if determined by the Remainder Trustee to be appropriate, a Qualified Real Estate Consultant with respect to the matter in question and shall proceed in the manner so determined to be in the best interests of the Certificateholders. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Remainder Trustee in so acting, including without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and any Qualified Real Estate Consultant retained by the Remainder Trustee on behalf of the Trust in connection with such Total Condemnation shall be Reimbursable Costs.</p>
    <p>(g) If there shall occur a Casualty Loss Termination, or if the Lease or the Tenant's right to possession thereunder shall be terminated in connection with an Event of Default, the Remainder Trustee shall so notify the Certificateholders in writing not later than five (5) business days after receipt by the Remainder Trustee of written notice thereof from the Term Trustee pursuant to the Administration Agreement or shall otherwise have obtained Actual Knowledge of such Casualty Loss Termination, and shall await the further written instructions of the Certificateholders. Following any such termination of the Lease or the Tenant's right to possession thereunder, the Remainder Trustee shall, subject to Section 4.4, enter into such Replacement Lease or amendment to the Lease as shall be directed in writing by the Certificateholders. All fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Remainder Trustee in acting pursuant to this Section 6.2(g) shall be Reimbursable Costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Remainder Trustee shall not be required to take any action, incur any expenses or advance any funds of the Remainder Trustee under this Section 6.2(g) unless: (1) there shall then be on deposit in the Administration Account funds sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Remainder Trustee, to provide for reimbursement of all Reimbursable Costs incurred or to be incurred by the Remainder Trustee in acting pursuant to this Section 6.2(g); or (2) the Remainder Trustee shall have received assurances from the Certificateholders (or otherwise) as to the source and manner for the reimbursement of such Reimbursable Costs reasonably satisfactory to the Remainder Trustee. If the Remainder Trustee shall seek such assurances from the Certificateholders and the Certificateholders shall fail or refuse to provide such assurances within fifteen (15) days after receipt of demand therefor, such failure or refusal shall (i) constitute a Termination Event and (ii) excuse further performance by the Remainder Trustee pursuant to this Section.</p>
    <p>(h) If there shall occur a Partial Condemnation, the Remainder Trustee shall so notify in writing the Certificateholders not later than five (5) business days after receipt by the Remainder Trustee of written notice thereof from the Term Trustee pursuant to the Administration Agreement or shall otherwise obtain Actual Knowledge of such Partial Condemnation and shall await the further written instructions of the Certificateholders.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.3 Rights of Remainder Trustee. The Remainder Trustee is authorized and directed to execute and deliver the Administration Agreement and each certificate or other document attached as an exhibit to or contemplated by this Agreement or the Administration Agreement to which the Trust is to be a party, in such form as the Certificateholders shall approve as evidenced conclusively by the Remainder Trustee's execution thereof. In addition to the foregoing, the Remainder Trustee is authorized, but shall not be obligated, to take all actions required of the Trust pursuant to the Lease and Administration Agreement. To the extent not prohibited by this Agreement or the Administration Agreement, the Remainder Trustee is further authorized from time to time to take such action as the Certificateholders recommend with respect to the Trust Estate.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.4 Acceptance of Trusts and Duties. Except as otherwise provided in this Article VI, in accepting the trusts hereby created, American National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago acts solely as Remainder Trustee hereunder and not in its individual capacity and all Persons having any claim against the Remainder Trustee by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall look only to the Trust Estate for payment or satisfaction thereof.

In particular, but not by way of limitation (and subject to the exceptions set forth in the preceding sentence):</p>
    <p>(a) except as specifically provided in Section 6.2 hereof, the Remainder Trustee shall at no time have any responsibility or liability for or with respect to sufficiency of the Trust Estate or its ability to generate the payments to be distributed to Certificateholders under this Agreement including, without limitation: the existence, condition and ownership of the Real Property; the existence and enforceability of any insurance thereon; or the performance or enforcement of the Lease.</p>
    <p>(b) the Renainder Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the instructions of the Certificateholders;</p>
    <p>(c) no provision of this Agreement or the Administration Agreement shall require the Remainder Trustee to expend or risk funds, incur any Reimbursable Cost, or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its rights or powers hereunder, if the Remainder Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured or provided to it;</p>
    <p>(d) under no circumstances shall the Remainder Trustee be liable for the payment of amounts due under the Certificates except for the distribution of amounts in the Administration Account in accordance with Section 5.3 hereof;</p>
    <p>(e) the Remainder Trustee shall not be responsible for or in respect of and makes no representation as to the validity or sufficiency of any provision of this Agreement or for the due execution hereof by the Seller or for the form, character, genuineness, sufficiency, value or validity of any of the Trust Estate or for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates (other than the certificate of authentication on the Certificates) and the Remainder Trustee shall in no event assume or incur any liability, duty or obligation to any Certificateholder, and shall not have any duties or responsibilities for supervision or oversight of contract performance, other than as expressly provided for herein and in the Administration Agreement;</p>

    <p>(ii) The Remainder Trustee shall not have any authority to control or operate the Real Property; and</p>
    <p>(iii) All contracts shall provide that any party to the contract will claim only against the Trust and Trust Estate for payment or to satisfy any claims or liabilities.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.5 Action upon Instruction by Certificateholders.</p>
    <p>(a) Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations hereof and the terms and conditions of the Administration Agreement, the Certificateholders may by written instruction direct the Remainder Trustee in the management of the Trust. Such direction may be exercised at any time by written instruction of the Certificateholders pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof.</p>
    <p>(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Remainder Trustee shall not be required to take any action hereunder or under the Administration Agreement if the Remainder Trustee shall have reasonably determined, or shall have been advised by counsel, that such action is likely to result in liability on the part of the Remainder Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of the Lease or Administration Agreement or is otherwise contrary to law or unduly prejudicial to the interests of the Certificateholders not joining in any such direction.</p>
    <p>(c) Whenever the Remainder Trustee is unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or required by the terms of this Agreement or Administration Agreement, or is unsure as to the application, intent, interpretation or meaning of any provision of this Agreement or Administration Agreement, the Remainder Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the Certificateholders requesting instruction as to the course of action to be adopted, and, to the extent the Remainder Trustee acts in good faith in accordance with any such instruction received, the Remainder Trustee shall not be liable on account of such action to any Person. If the Remainder Trustee shall not have received appropriate instructions within ten days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action which is consistent, in its view, with this Agreement and the Administration Agreement, and as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Certificateholders, and the Remainder Trustee shall have no liability to any Person for any such action or inaction.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.6 Furnishing of Documents. The Remainder Trustee shall furnish to the Certificateholders, promptly upon receipt of a written request therefor, duplicates or copies of all reports, notices, requests, demands, certificates, financial statements and any other instruments furnished to the Remainder Trustee under the Lease or hereunder.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.7 Representations and Warranties of Remainder Trustee. The Remainder Trustee hereby represents and warrants to the Seller, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, that:</p>
    <p>(a) It is a national banking association duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States.</p>
    <p>(b) It has full power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement, and has taken all necessary action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>(c) The execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement (i) shall not violate any provision of any law or regulation governing the banking and trust powers of the Remainder Trustee or any order, writ, judgment or decree of any court, arbitrator or governmental authority applicable to the Remainder Trustee or any of its assets, (ii) shall not violate any provision of the articles of association or by-laws of the Remainder Trustee, or (iii) shall not violate any provision of, or constitute, with or without notice or lapse of time, a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien on any properties included in the Trust Estate pursuant to the provisions of any mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement or other undertaking to which it is a party.</p>
    <p>(d) The execution, delivery and performance by the Remainder Trustee of this Agreement shall not require the authorization, consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the filing or registration with, or the taking of any other action in respect of, any governmental authority or agency regulating the banking and corporate trust activities of banks or trust companies in the jurisdiction in which the Trust was formed.</p>
    <p>(e) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Remainder Trustee and constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Remainder Trustee, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in general and by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.8 Reliance; Advice of Counsel.</p>
    <p>(a) The Remainder Trustee shall incur no liability to anyone in acting upon any signature, instrument, notice, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other document or paper believed by it to be genuine and believed by it to be signed by the proper party or parties and need not investigate any fact or matter in any such document. The Remainder Trustee may accept a certified copy of a resolution of the board of directors or other governing body of any corporate party as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted by such body and that the same is in full force and effect. As to any fact or matter the method of the determination of which is not specifically prescribed herein, the Remainder Trustee may for all purposes hereof rely on a certificate, signed by the president or any vice president or by the treasurer or other authorized officers of the relevant party, as to such fact or matter, and such certificate shall constitute full protection to the Remainder Trustee for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon.</p>
    <p>(b) In the exercise or administration of the trusts hereunder and in the performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement or the Administration Agreement, the Remainder Trustee: (i) may act directly or through its agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees (including the granting of a power of attorney to officers of American National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago to execute and deliver any documents related thereto on behalf of the Remainder Trustee) pursuant to agreements entered into with any of them, and the Remainder Trustee shall not be liable for the conduct or misconduct of such agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees if such agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees shall have been selected by the Remainder Trustee with reasonable care; and (ii) may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled professionals to be selected with reasonable care and employed by it. The Remainder Trustee shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the opinion or advice of any such counsel, accountants or other such Persons and not contrary to this Agreement or the Administration Agreement.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.9 Remainder Trustee Shall Not Own Certificates and Notes. The Remainder Trustee shall not, in its individual or any other capacity, become the owner or pledgee of Certificates, but may otherwise deal with other parties to this Agreement, the Lease, the Administration Agreement, and the Certificateholders with the same rights it would have were it not Term Trustee hereunder.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.10 Compensation; Reimbursable Costs. The Remainder Trustee shall receive as compensation for its services hereunder a one-time fee in the amount of $20,000.00 payable upon execution of this Agreement by the Remainder Trustee, and the Remainder Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed from time to time by the Certificateholders or the Trust Estate, as the circumstances may require, for all Reimbursable Costs as the Remainder Trustee may incur in connection with the exercise and performance of its rights and its duties hereunder. Any amounts paid to the Remainder Trustee pursuant to this Article VI shall be deemed not to be a part of the Trust Estate immediately after such payment. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Remainder Trustee from and against any loss suffered or cost incurred by the Remainder Trustee for any Reimbursable Cost for which the Remainder Trustee does not receive reimbursement from the Certificateholders, or the Trust Estate, as the circumstances may require, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (“Unrecovered Costs”), provided the Remainder Trustee shall have first used all commercially reasonable efforts to recover such Unrecovered Costs from the Certificateholders, or the Trust Estate, as the circumstances may require. Seller shall make payment to the Remainder Trustee of any Unrecovered Costs in respect of which the Remainder Trustee is entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of written demand therefor setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and amount of such Unrecovered Costs and the actions taken by the Remainder Trustee to collect the same from the Certificateholders and the Trust Estate, as the case may be. Upon the making of any payment hereunder by the Seller, the Seller shall be subrogated to all rights and claims of the Remainder Trustee against the Certificateholders and the Trust Estate in respect of the Unrecovered Costs so paid by the Seller arising under this Agreement or otherwise.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.11 Replacement of Remainder Trustee.</p>
    <p>(a) The Remainder Trustee may resign at any time and be discharged from the trusts hereby created by giving thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof to the Certificateholders or such lesser period as the Certificateholders shall agree. The Certificateholders shall appoint a successor Remainder Trustee meeting the requirements of Section 6.14 by delivering a written instrument, in duplicate, to the resigning Remainder Trustee and the successor Remainder Trustee. If no successor Remainder Trustee shall have been appointed and have accepted appointment within thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Seller, upon written notice thereof from the resigning Remainder Trustee, may appoint such successor Remainder Trustee meeting the requirements of Section 6.14 by delivering a written instruction to such effect to the resigning Remainder Trustee and the successor Remainder Trustee within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice from the resigning Remainder Trustee. If no successor Remainder Trustee shall have been appointed and have accepted appointment prior to the expiration of such second thirty (30) day period, the resigning Remainder Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Remainder Trustee. The Certificateholders shall remove the Remainder Trustee if:</p>
    <p>(i) the Remainder Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.12 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Certificateholders;</p>
    <p>(ii) the Remainder Trustee shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;</p>
    <p>(iii) a receiver or other public officer shall be appointed or take charge or control of the Remainder Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation; or</p>
    <p>(iv) the Remainder Trustee shall otherwise be incapable of acting.</p>
    <p>(b) If the Remainder Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Remainder Trustee for any reason the Certificateholders shall promptly appoint a successor Remainder Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate (one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the outgoing Remainder Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor Remainder Trustee) and shall pay all fees owed to the outgoing Remainder Trustee.</p>
    <p>(c) Any resignation or removal of the Remainder Trustee and appointment of a successor Remainder Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall not become effective until a written acceptance of appointment is delivered by the successor Remainder Trustee to the outgoing Remainder Trustee and the Certificateholders and all fees and expenses due to the outgoing Remainder Trustee are paid. Any successor Remainder Trustee appointed pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall be eligible to act in such capacity in accordance with Section 6.14 and, following compliance with the preceding sentence, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor under this Agreement, with like effect as if originally named as Remainder Trustee.</p>
    <p>(d) The predecessor Remainder Trustee shall upon payment of its fees and expenses deliver to the successor Remainder Trustee all documents and statements and monies held by it under this Agreement. The Certificateholders and the predecessor Remainder Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor Remainder Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.12 Merger or Consolidation of Remainder Trustee. Any corporation into which the Remainder Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Remainder Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Remainder Trustee, shall be the successor of the Remainder Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be eligible pursuant to Section 6.14, and without the execution or filing of any instrument or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.13 Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.</p>
    <p>(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in which the Trust Estate is located, the Certificateholders and the Remainder Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the Remainder Trustee to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Remainder Trustee, or as separate trustee or trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Estate, and to vest in such Person, in such capacity, such title to the Trust Estate, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.13, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Certificateholders and the Remainder Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. If the Certificateholders shall not have joined in such appointment within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a request so to do, the Remainder Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee pursuant to Section 6.14 and no notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required pursuant to Section 6.11.</p>
    <p>(b) Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:</p>
    <p>(i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Remainder Trustee shall be conferred upon and exercised or performed by the Remainder Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Remainder Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed, the Remainder Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust Estate or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the Remainder Trustee;</p>
    <p>(ii) no trustee under this Agreement shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee under this Agreement; and</p>
    <p>(iii) the Certificateholders and the Remainder Trustee acting jointly may at any time accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.</p>
    <p>(c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Remainder Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Remainder Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Remainder Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the Remainder Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Certificateholders.</p>
    <p>(d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the Remainder Trustee as its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Remainder Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor trustee.</p>
    <p>SECTION 6.14 Eligibility Requirements for Remainder Trustee. The Remainder Trustee shall at all times be a corporation or other person or entity authorized pursuant to applicable laws to exercise corporate trust powers with respect to the Trust Estate. If at any time the Remainder Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.14, the Remainder Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 6.11.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE VII</heading> <heading>TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT</heading> <p>SECTION 7.1 Termination of Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>(a) This Agreement (other than Section 6.10) and the Trust shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the final distribution by the Remainder Trustee of all monies or other property or proceeds of the Trust Estate in accordance with the terms hereof following the occurrence of a Termination Event or at the time provided in Section 7.2. The bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, death or incapacity of any Certificateholder, shall not (x) operate to terminate this Agreement or the Trust, nor (y) entitle such Certificateholder's legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of all or any part of the Trust or the Trust Estate nor (z) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto.</p>
    <p>(b) Except as provided in Section 7.1 (a), neither the Seller nor any Certificateholder shall be entitled to revoke or terminate the Trust.</p>
    <p>(c) Notice of any termination of the Trust, specifying the date upon which the Certificateholders shall surrender their Certificates to the Remainder Trustee for final distribution and cancellation (the “Final Distribution Date”), shall be given by the Remainder Trustee by letter to Certificateholders mailed within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of a Termination Event (a “Termination Notice”), stating: (i) the Final Distribution Date at which time final distribution of the Trust Estate and payment (if any) of the Certificates shall be made upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office of the Remainder Trustee therein designated; (ii) the amount (if then known) of any such final payment; and (iii) that distribution of the Trust Estate and any other payments will be made only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office of the Remainder Trustee therein specified. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Distribution Date, the Certificateholders shall, by unanimous written direction, advise the Remainder Trustee as to the full legal name, business address and any other information reasonably requested by the Remainder Trustee of the Person to whom the Remainder Trustee shall convey all of its right, title and interest in the Trust Estate on the Distribution Date (the “Successor Owner”). Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Remainder Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Certificateholders amounts distributable on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 5.2, and, in addition, shall cause all of the right, title and interest of the Remainder Trustee in and to the Trust Estate and all accounts established by the Remainder Trustee in connection therewith to be transferred to the Successor Owner by such bills of sale, assignments, deeds or other instruments of conveyance as shall be reasonably necessary therefor, all without warranties or covenants of any nature whatsoever. The Final Distribution Date shall be not later than: (i) in the event of a Total Condemnation, thirty (30) days following receipt by the Remainder Trustee of the Remainder Proceeds payable with respect thereto; (ii) in the event of a sale of the Trust Estate pursuant to Section 7.2, thirty (30) days following receipt by the Remainder Trustee of the proceeds from such sale; and (iii) in any other case, forty-five (45) days after the occurrence of the Termination Event giving rise to the termination of the Trust.</p>
    <p>(d) If all of the Certificateholders shall not surrender their Certificates for cancellation within thirty (30) days after the date specified in the Termination Notice referred to in subsection 7.1 (c) or if the Certificateholders shall fail to designate by unanimous written direction the Successor Owner within the time required hereby, the Remainder Trustee shall give a second written notice so stating. If within thirty (30) days after the second notice all the Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, or a Successor Owner has not been designated in accordance herewith, the Remainder Trustee may take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact the remaining Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates or designation of a Successor Owner, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds and other assets that shall remain subject to this Agreement.</p>
    <p>SECTION 7.2 Termination Pursuant to Section 6.2. If a Termination Event shall occur pursuant to Section 6.2, or if the Certificateholders shall fail to designate a Successor Owner pursuant to Section 7.1(c) within sixty (60) days after notice thereof given pursuant to Section 7.1 (d), the Remainder Trustee shall give a Termination Notice thereof to the Certificateholders and to the parties to whom such notice is required pursuant to the Administration Agreement and the Remainder Trustee shall thereafter sell the assets of the Trust Estate at an open outcry auction held in a commercially reasonable manner and on commercially reasonable terms on a date not earlier than thirty (30) days and not later than ninety (90) days after such Termination Notice has been given by the Remainder Trustee all as more particularly set forth herein. Such Termination Notice shall specify the time, place and terms of such auction. The Remainder Trustee shall engage a Qualified Real Estate Consultant for the purpose of consulting with the Remainder Trustee regarding the Auctioneer to be engaged by the Remainder Trustee and the terms and conditions of the auction to be conducted thereby. Such Qualified Real Estate Consultant shall make a written recommendation to the Remainder Trustee regarding the identity of the Auctioneer to be selected and the terms on which the auction shall be conducted; provided, however, that in all events, the Auctioneer shall conduct any auction held pursuant hereto: (i) at the Corporate Trust Offices; (ii) on an open outcry basis with no reserve price or minimum bid; (iii) only after publication of the time and place for such auction in a manner and with such publications as shall then be required to satisfy the requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code, or any successor legislation, as then in effect in the jurisdiction in which such auction shall be held, with respect to sales of collateral thereunder; (iv) pursuant to bidding rules that shall specify the form of purchase and sale agreement to be entered into between the Remainder Trustee and the successful bidder at the auction, which agreement shall be in the form recommended by the Qualified Real Estate Consultant and counsel engaged by the Remainder Trustee in connection with such auction; and (v) substantially in accordance with the rules and procedures recommended by the Qualified Real Estate Consultant and counsel engaged by the Trustee in connection with such auction. The Remainder Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such recommendations for all purposes of this Agreement. Certificateholders, and any Person controlling or controlled by, owning, owned by or under common ownership with any Certificateholder, shall not be entitled to participate in such auction. The proceeds of any such sale, disposition or liquidation of the assets of the Trust shall be applied first to any outstanding Reimbursable Costs, second to any outstanding fees due to the Remainder Trustee in connection with this Agreement and the balance shall constitute Collections and shall be deposited into the Administration Account for distribution in accordance with the terms hereof.</p>
    <p>SECTION 7.3 Distribution of Remainder Proceeds. If there shall occur a Total Condemnation, the Remainder Trustee shall, in connection with the winding-up of the Trust, distribute the Remainder Proceeds to the Certificateholders on the final Distribution Date.</p>
    <p>SECTION 7.4 Default by Purchaser. If the purchaser of the Trust Estate at any auction held pursuant to Section 7.2 shall default in the performance of its obligations under the purchase and sale agreement entered into in connection therewith in the manner and time required thereby, and such default shall give rise to a right to terminate such purchase and sale agreement on the part of the Remainder Trustee, the Remainder Trustee is hereby irrevocably authorized and directed to terminate such agreement in accordance with its terms and to conduct another auction of the Trust Estate in the manner set forth in Section 7.2. If the Purchaser at any such subsequent auction shall likewise fail to perform its obligations to purchase the Trust Estate and such failure shall give rise to a right to terminate the purchase and sale agreement entered into in connection therewith, then the Remainder Trustee shall terminate such agreement in accordance with its terms and proceed in the manner set forth herein.</p>
    <heading>ARTICLE VIII</heading> <heading>AMENDMENTS</heading> <p>SECTION 8.1 Amendments.</p>

In addition, this Certificate is not guaranteed by any governmental agency or instrumentality and is limited in right of payment to certain collections and recoveries with respect to the Trust Estate (and certain other amounts), all as more specifically set forth herein and in the Trust Agreement.

    <p>The Trust Agreement does not permit, with certain exceptions therein provided, the amendment thereof or the modification of the rights and obligations of the Seller and the rights of the Certificateholders under the Trust Agreement. To the extent such amendments and modifications are permitted, the same may be made only with the consent of Certificateholders whose Certificates evidence not less than a majority of the Voting Interests as of the close of business on the immediately preceding Record Date.

    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
    <p>In connection with our proposed purchase of a certificate of beneficial interest (the “Certificate”), representing a fractional undivided interest in the K.C. LURE® Trust 1995-1, issued under a trust agreement, dated as of Apr. 27, 1995 (the “Trust Agreement”), between Scribcor, Inc., an Illinois corporation (the “Seller”) and American National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, as owner trustee, acting thereunder not in its individual capacity but solely as remainder trustee of the Trust (the “Remainder Trustee”) we certify that:</p>
    <p>1. We understand that the Certificate has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be sold except as permitted in the following sentence. We agree, on our own behalf and on behalf of any accounts for which we are acting as hereinafter stated, that such Certificate may be resold, pledged or transferred only to: (i) the Seller; (ii) an institutional investor that is an “Accredited Investor” as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) (an “Institutional Accredited Investor”) under the Securities Act (as indicated by the box checked by the transferor on the Certificate of Transfer on the reverse of the Certificate) acting for its own account and not for the account of others or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are Institutional Accredited Investors unless the holder is a bank acting in its fiduciary capacity) that executes a certificate substantially in the form hereof, (iii) so long as such Certificate is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”), to a person whom we reasonably believe after due inquiry to be a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A acting for its own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are “qualified institutional buyers” to whom notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, or (iv) in a sale, pledge or other transfer made in a transaction otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in which case (A) the Remainder Trustee shall require a written opinion of counsel (which will not be at the expense of the Seller or the Remainder Trustee) satisfactory to the Seller and the Remainder Trustee to the effect that such transfer will not violate the Securities Act, in each in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. We will notify any purchaser of the Certificate from us of the above resale restrictions, if then applicable. We further understand that in connection with any transfer of the Certificate by us that the Seller and the Remainder Trustee may request, and if so requested we will furnish, such certificates and other information as they may reasonably require to confirm that any such transfer complies with the foregoing restrictions. We understand that no sale, pledge or other transfer may be made to any one person for Certificates with a face amount of less than $20,000 and, in the case of any person acting on behalf of one or more third parties (other than a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) acting in its fiduciary capacity), for the Certificates with a face amount of less than $20,000 for each such third party.</p>
    <p>2. [CHECK ONE]</p>
    <p>(a) We are an institutional investor and an “accredited investor” (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act) acting for our own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are Institutional Accredited Investors unless we are bank acting in its fiduciary capacity). We have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of our investment in the Certificate, and we and any accounts for which we are acting are each able to bear the economic risk of our or its investment for an indefinite period of time. We are acquiring the Certificate for investment and not with a view to, or for offer and sale in connection with, a public distribution.</p>
    <p>(b) We re a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and are acquiring the Certificate for our own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are “qualified institutional buyers”). We are familiar with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and are aware that the seller of the Certificate and other parties intend to rely on the statements made herein and the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.</p>
    <p>3. You are entitled to rely upon this letter and you are irrevocably authorized to produce this letter or a copy thereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the matters covered hereby.</p>

    <p>Summary of Lease Provisions</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <p>The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Lease. This summary is not a complete description of the terms of the Lease, and reference is made to the Lease for its detailed provisions. Section references are to the corresponding provisions of the Lease the terms of which are incorporated by reference thereto.</p>
    <p>Pursuant to the Lease, the Tenant has leased during the Initial Term (as defined below) the Property, which contains all 94,176 rentable square feet of office space in the Old American Life Insurance Building (the “Building”), comprised of (i) 66,396 rentable square feet of office space on floors 1 through 3 of the Building and (ii) 27,780 rentable square feet of space in the Building's basement, which is utilized as a cafeteria, print shop and other office service facilities and (iii) the Building's three-story covered parking garage, containing spaces for 250 cars. The term “Premises,” as used herein, shall refer to the Property (including the Building).</p>
    <p>Term</p>
    <p>The initial 20-year term of the Lease (the “Initial Term”) commenced on Dec. 29, 1989 and will expire on Dec. 31, 2009, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Lease pertaining to casualty loss or condemnation or the exercise of the Landlord's remedies under the Lease. The tenant has the option to extend the term of the Lease for two additional periods of five years (each, a “Renewal Term”). The Initial Term and the Renewal Terms are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the “Term.”</p>
    <p>In the event that the Property has been subleased to not more than two subtenants, for a term, including renewals, which shall expire not more than three years after the expiration of the Term, the Tenant shall have the right, at its option, to renew the Term for an additional period of either one, two or three years, so that the Term, as so renewed, shall expire after the expiration of such subleases; provided, Tenant shall have no further right to renew or extend the Term of the Lease. (Article III.D.)</p>
    <p>Base Rent</p>
    <p>The Tenant is obligated to pay the annual base rent (“Base Rent”) in equal installments on the first day of each month during the Term, without any right of set-off or deduction whatsoever. The annual and monthly Base Rent prescribed by the Lease during each year during the Initial Term and Renewal Terms is as follows:</p>

    <p>The Lease is a so-called “triple-net” lease—i.e., it is the intent of Landlord and Tenant that the Lease will yield, net to Landlord, the Base Rent as above specified, and that all costs and expenses relating to the Premises shall be paid by the Tenant. (Article V.A.) Accordingly, in addition to Base Rent, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord as additional rent (the “Additional Rent”), without right of reduction, set-off or abatement, all costs and expenses relating to the Premises, including taxes, utility expenses and costs of insurance, and repair and maintenance expenses, all as more fully described below.</p>
    <p>Taxes</p>
    <p>Tenant has agreed to pay as Additional Rent, before any fine or costs may be added for nonpayment, all real estate taxes, assessments, water and sewer rents, rates and charges, ad valorem taxes, gross receipts taxes, sales and use taxes, and other similar governmental charges which may at any time during the Term be assessed in respect of the Premises and to furnish to Landlord official receipts or other satisfactory proof evidencing such payment. (Article VI.A.)</p>
    <p>Repairs and Maintenance</p>
    <p>Tenant is required, at its sole cost and expense, to keep the Premises and all parts thereof, including without limitation, all sidewalks, curbs, parking areas, access ways and landscaped areas, in good order, repair and condition, whether interior or exterior, structural or nonstructural, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, including, without limitation, repair of all glass, utilities, conduits, fixtures, equipment, foundations, roofs, exterior and interior walls, heating and air conditioning systems, lighting fixtures, wiring, plumbing, sprinkler systems, paving, sidewalks, roads, parking areas, curbs, gutters and fences. The necessity for and adequacy of all repairs to be made to the Premises pursuant to the Lease shall be measured by the standard which is appropriate for suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area of similar construction, class and age. (Article VII.A.)</p>
    <p>If, during the last twelve months of the Term, Tenant is required pursuant to any applicable legal requirement to make structural repairs or alterations to the Premises (a “Mandated Repair”), then in such case if a Mandated Repair must be completed prior to the expiration of the Term, Tenant shall be responsible for completing the Mandated Repair at its sole cost and expense. If, however, a Mandated Repair may be completed over a period of time which extends beyond the expiration of the Term, but work on such Mandated Repair must be commenced prior to the expiration of the Term, then in such event Tenant is required to commence the work on the Mandated Repair and is obligated to pay that portion of the work which is equal to the result obtained by pro rating the total cost of the Mandated Repair over the period of time during which such Mandated Repair may or must be completed and allocating to Tenant the amount allocable to the balance of the Term. (Article VII.C.)</p>
    <p>Utilities and Services</p>
    <p>Landlord is not required to furnish any utilities or services to Tenant. Tenant is responsible for the procurement of and payment for all charges for electricity, power, gas, steam, water, telephone and other utilities and services, including without limitation, cleaning and maintenance services used in connection with the Premises. (Article XI).</p>
    <p>Insurance</p>
    <p>Tenant shall maintain at all times, at its sole cost and expense, insurance coverage as follows:</p>
    <p>1. All-risk property insurance for the full replacement cost of the Property (with a deductible of not more than $25,000);</p>
    <p>2. Commercial general public liability insurance against claims for bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on or about the Premises in a single limit amount of $10,000,000 with respect to bodily injury or death arising out of any one accident or occurrence;</p>
    <p>3. Boiler and machinery insurance in the amount of at least $1,000,000 (with a dedUctible of not more than $10,000);</p>
    <p>4. Worker's compensation insurance to the extent required by law;</p>
    <p>5. During any period of construction with respect to the Building, builders' risk insurance on a completed value basis for the total cost of any alterations;</p>
    <p>6. If and to the extent such insurance is commonly obtained by prudent owners of suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area, environmental impairment insurance in such amounts as are commonly obtained by such prudent owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be required to carry such environmental impairment insurance so long as its net worth exceeds Tenant's Minimum Net Worth (as defined) (and further provided that, to the extent that Tenant is required to carry such insurance because its net worth is equal to or less than Tenant's Minimum Net Worth, Tenant may maintain a deductible with respect to such insurance of not more than 5% of its net worth);</p>
    <p>7. Such other insurance in such amounts as are commonly obtained at the time in question by prudent owners of suburban office buildings in the Kansas City metropolitan area.</p>
    <p>For purposes of the foregoing paragraph (6), “Tenant's Minimum Net Worth” is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $50,000,000 or (ii) the product of (1) 50 times (2) the Base Rent and taxes with respect to the Premises payable by the Tenant in the then-current calendar year. All insurance maintained by Tenant with respect to the Premises must name Landlord as an additional insured as its interest may appear. In addition, at the request of Landlord, but not more than once every three years, Tenant at Tenant's sole cost and expense shall increase the limits of liability on any of the insurance policies Tenant is otherwise required to maintain to such greater amounts as Landlord shall reasonably request. (Article XII)</p>
    <p>All proceeds of insurance maintained by Tenant under the Lease shall be payable to and administered by the Trustee under the terms of the Trust Agreement.</p>
    <p>Fire and Other Casualty</p>
    <p>In the event of damage or destruction during the second to last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 75% of the replacement value of the Premises) or in the event of damage or destruction during the last year of the Term (the repair and restoration of which would cost in excess of 25% of the replacement value of the Premises), then in each such event, Landlord or Tenant, upon 30 days' written notice to the other, may terminate the Lease, provided that any and all insurance proceeds in such case received by Tenant are required to be paid to and assigned to Landlord. (Article XIV.B.)</p>
    <p>Condemnation</p>
    <p>Tenant has irrevocably assigned to Landlord any award or payment to which Tenant may be or become entitled by reason of any taking of the Premises or any part thereof by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, by any governmental authority, civil or military. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to any award or payment on account of Tenant's trade fixtures, equipment and moving expenses, to the extent Tenant shall have a right to make a separate claim therefor against the appropriate governmental authority. (Article XV.A.)</p>
    <p>If all or substantially all of the Property shall be taken by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings, then the Lease shall terminate on the day preceding the date of the vesting of title to the Premises or portion thereof in the condemning authority, and Base Rent and Additional Rent shall be paid to the date of such termination. (Article XV.B.)</p>
    <p>If condemnation shall effect at least 50% of the Premises and, in Tenant's reasonable judgment, shall render the Premises unsuitable for restoration for continued use and occupancy, then Tenant shall, not later than 30 days after such condemnation, deliver to Landlord (i) notice of its intention to terminate the Lease on the next rental payment date which occurs not less than 90 days after the delivery of such notice (the “Condemnation Termination Date”), (ii) a certificate of an authorized officer of the Tenant describing the event giving rise to such termination and (iii) an irrevocable offer by Tenant to Landlord to purchase on the Condemnation Termination Date (a) any remaining portion of the Premises and (b) the right to receive the net proceeds, if any, payable in connection with such condemnation, at a price equal to ten times the then annual Base Rent. If Landlord shall reject such offer by notice given to Tenant not later than 15 days prior to the Condemnation Termination Date, the Lease shall terminate on the Condemnation Termination Date upon payment by Tenant of all Base Rent, Additional Rent and other sums then due and payable to and including the Condemnation Termination Date. (Article XV.C.)</p>
    <p>If less than 50% of the Premises shall be taken by condemnation or other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general or special, or the use or occupancy of the Premises or any part thereof shall be temporarily requisitioned by any governmental authority, civil or military, then the Lease shall continue in full force and effect without abatement or reduction of Base Rent, Additional Rent or other sums payable by Tenant. In such event, Tenant is obligated after such taking or requisition, at its sole cost and expense, to repair any damage caused by any such taking or requisition in conformity with the provisions in the Lease governing the making of alterations to the Premises. (Article XV.E.)</p>
    <p>Assignment and Subletting</p>
    <p>Tenant shall have the right to assign the Lease (in whole, but not in part) or to sublet the premises (in whole or in part) without the consent of Landlord, provided that in the case of a subletting, no subletting shall be for a term ending later than one day prior to the expiration date of the Term. No assignment shall be deemed a waiver of any agreement, term, covenant or condition of the Lease or a release of Tenant from the performance or further performance by Tenant of the agreements, terms, convenants, conditions of the Lease, and Tenant shall continue to be primarily liable under the Lease in accordance with its terms. (Article XVI.A.)</p>
    <p>The merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all the assets of Tenant shall be deemed to be an assignment of the Lease. However, it shall be a condition precedent to the merger of Tenant into another corporation or the consolidation of the Tenant with one or more other corporations, that the surviving entity shall (i) have a minimum net worth at least equal to the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, (ii) deliver to Landlord a certified financial statement evidencing satisfaction of the requirement set forth in the foregoing clause (i), and (iii) deliver to Landlord an acknowledged instrument in recordable form assuming all obligations, covenants and responsibilities of Tenant under the Lease. (Article XVI.E.)</p>
    <p>Environmental Matters</p>
    <p>Tenant has agreed not to use, manufacture, store, dispose or sell any substance or material (collectively, “Hazardous Materials”) identified to be toxic, or hazardous according to any applicable federal, state or local statute, law, rule or regulation relating to regulation or control of toxic or hazardous substances or materials (“Environmental Laws”). If tenant receives any written notice of any event involving the use, spill, discharge, dumping or clean-up of any Hazardous Material in at or about the Premises or into the sewer, septic system or waste treatment servicing the Premises (any such event being hereinafter referred to as a “Hazardous Discharge”) or any complaint, order, citation or notice with regard to such Hazardous Discharge, then in such event Tenant shall give immediate oral and written notice of same to Landlord.</p>
    <p>For purposes of the Lease, the following event constitutes an Event of Default:</p>
    <p>If the Environmental Protection Agency, or any other local, state or federal agency asserts or creates a lien upon any or all the Premises by reason of (a) the presence of Hazardous Materials in, on, under, at or about the Premises, (b) the occurrence of a Hazardous Discharge, (c) an environmental complaint, or (d) any violation of any environmental law or otherwise; or if the EPA or any other local, state or federal agency asserts a written claim against Tenant, the Premises or Landlord for damages or clean-up costs related to the presence of Hazardous Materials, a Hazardous Discharge or an environmental complaint on or pertaining to the Premises; provided, however, such claim or lien shall not constitute a default if, within ten days after Tenant receives written notice of such lien or claim:</p>
    <p>(a) Tenant shall commence and shall thereafter pursue with due diligence either (i) the cure or correction of the event which constitutes the basis for the claim of lien and continues with due diligence to pursue such cure or correction to completion or (ii) proceedings for an injunction, restraining order or other appropriate proceedings are brought by Tenant with due diligence seeking relief of the matter giving rise to the claim and the relief thereby obtained is not thereafter reversed on appeal; and</p>
    <p>(b) In either of the foregoing events, Tenant shall have posted a bond, letter of credit or other security required by law satisfactory in form, substance and amount to the agency or entity asserting the claim to secure the proper and complete cure or correction of the event which constitutes the basis for the claim.</p>
    <p>Tenant has agreed to defend, indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims (including, without limitation), wrongful death actions and third-party claims (but excluding claims for consequential damages) arising directly or indirectly from the presence of any Hazardous Material in, on, under, at or about the Premises or any Hazardous Discharge in, on, under, at or about the Premises, or any environmental complaint. (Article XIII.)</p>
    <p>Alterations</p>
    <p>Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, may make alterations or additions or other improvements to the Premises or any part thereof, provided that any alterations or additions (i) shall not reduce the fair market value of the Premises below its value immediately before such alteration or impair the usefulness or structural integrity of the Building or change the use thereof; (ii) shall not reduce the gross leasable area of the Premises, (iii) are effected in good and workmanlike manner in a safe and careful fashion in compliance with all applicable legal requirements and (iv) are fully paid for by the Tenant. (Article VIII.)</p>
    <p>Covenant Against Liens</p>
    <p>Tenant shall not permit any mechanics' or similar liens for labor or materials furnished to the Premises during the Term to be filed against the Premises or any part thereof and, if such lien shall be filed, Tenant shall either pay the same or procure the discharge thereof in any manner permitted by law within 30 days after such filing. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord and save Landlord harmless from and against any and all loss, damage, claims, liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses arising out of the filing of any such lien. (Article X.)</p>
    <p>Default Provisions; Landlord's Remedies</p>
    <p>The occurrence of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an “Event of Default”) under the Lease:</p>
    <p>1. Tenant's failure to pay any Base Rent, Additional Rent or any other sum required to be paid pursuant to the Lease, and such failure shall continue for 10 days after notice to Tenant of such failure;</p>
    <p>2. The occurrence of an Event of Default described under “Environmental Matters” above;</p>
    <p>3. Tenant's failure to observe or perform any other provision of the Lease and such failure shall continue for 30 days after notice to Tenant of such failure;</p>
    <p>4. If Tenant shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall file a voluntary petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or an involuntary petition alleging any act of bankruptcy or insolvency shall be filed against Tenant, and the occurrence of certain other bankruptcy-related events, and in such case such events shall occur and continue without the acquiescence of Tenant for a period of 90 days;</p>
    <p>5. The occurrence of any event or contingency whereby the Lease or the estate thereby created or the unexpired balance of the Lease Term would, by operation of law or otherwise, devolve upon pass to any person, firm or corporation, except as expressly permitted in the Lease; or</p>
    <p>6. If Tenant shall abandon all of the Demised Premises by vacating the premises and failing to (i) maintain the premises, (ii) make all repairs thereto, (iii) maintain security and/or (iv) comply with all the terms, covenants and provisions thereof for a period in excess of 30 days.</p>
    <p>If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Landlord shall have the right to give Tenant a five-day notice of Landlord's termination of the Lease. Upon expiration of such five-day period, the Lease and the estate thereby granted shall expire and terminate, and all rights of Tenant under the Lease shall expire and terminate, but Tenant shall remain liable under the Lease as hereinafter provided. (Article XVIII.B)</p>
    <p>Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Landlord shall have the following additional rights and remedies:</p>
    <p>1. Landlord shall have the right to reenter the Premises, to dispossess Tenant by a summary proceeding or other appropriate suit and, at Tenant's expense, to remove, for the sole benefit of Landlord, Tenant's effects and to hold the Premises and the right to receive all rental and other income of and from the Premises;</p>
    <p>2. In the case of any such reentry termination and/or disposition the Base Rent, Additional Rent and any other sums payable by Tenant under the Lease shall become immediately due and be paid up to the time of such reentry, disposition and/or termination, together with such reasonable expenses as Landlord may incur for legal expenses, attorneys' fees and disbursements; Landlord may relet the premises or any part or parts thereof for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term;</p>
    <p>3. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord as liquidated damages an amount equal to the Liquidated Damages Amount hereinafter set forth; and</p>
    <p>4. Landlord shall have the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as if reentry, summary proceedings and other remedies were not provided for in the Lease.</p>
    <p>In the event of any termination of the Lease or in the event that Landlord shall reenter the premises as above described, Tenant will pay to Landlord as liquidated damages, at the election of Landlord; either:</p>
    <p>(i) A sum equal to the excess, if any, discounted at 8% per annum, of (x) the full amount of Rent reserved under the Lease for the balance of the unexpired portion of the Initial Term, or a Renewal Term, as applicable, and the Additional Rent and other charges or sums payable by Tenant hereunder which would have been payable had the Lease not so terminated, over (y) the aggregate rental value of the Premises for the same period considered on a net rental basis, such sum to be immediately due in full upon such termination or reentry; or</p>
    <p>(ii) a sum which is equal to the aggregate of the Base Rent reserved under the Lease for the balance of the unexpired portion of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, and the Additional Rent and other charges or sums payable by Tenant thereunder which would have been payable by Tenant had the Lease not so terminated, or had Landlord not so reentered the Premises, payable upon the due dates specified in the Lease following such termination or such reentry and until the date for the expiration of the Initial Term or such Renewal Term, as applicable, as provided herein.
