The system maintains first databases of patents, and second databases of non-patent information of interest to a corporate entity. The system also maintains one or more groups. Each of the groups comprises any number of the patents from the first databases. The system, upon receiving appropriate operator commands, automatically processes the patents in one of the groups in conjunction with non-patent information from the second databases. Accordingly, the system performs patent-centric and group-oriented processing of data. A group can also include any number of non-patent documents. The groups may be product based, person based, corporate entity based, or user-defined. Other types of groups are also covered, such as temporary groups. The processing automatically performed by the system relates to (but is not limited to) patent mapping, document mapping, patent citation (both forward and backward), patent aging, patent bracketing/clustering (both forward and backward), inventor patent count, inventor employment information, and finance. Other functions are also covered."><meta name="DC.date" content="1999-11-23" scheme="issued"><meta name="DC.relation" content="EP:0239884:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation"

The system maintains first databases of patents, and second databases of non-patent information of interest to a corporate entity. The system also maintains one or more groups. Each of the groups comprises any number of the patents from the first databases. The system, upon receiving appropriate operator commands, automatically processes the patents in one of the groups in conjunction with non-patent information from the second databases. Accordingly, the system performs patent-centric and group-oriented processing of data. A group can also include any number of non-patent documents. The groups may be product based, person based, corporate entity based, or user-defined. Other types of groups are also covered, such as temporary groups. The processing automatically performed by the system relates to (but is not limited to) patent mapping, document mapping, patent citation (both forward and backward), patent aging, patent bracketing/clustering (both forward and backward), inventor patent count, inventor employment information, and finance. Other functions are also covered."/><meta property="og:title" content="Patent US5991751 - System, method, and computer program product for patent-centric and group-oriented data processing"/><meta property="og:type" content="book"/><meta property="og:site_name" content="Google Books"/><meta property="og:image" content="http://www.google.com/patents?id=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1"/><link rel="image_src" href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1"/><script>(function(){try{var aa=function(a,b,c,d){d=d||{};d._sn=["cfg",b,c].join(".");window.gbar.logger.ml(a,d)};var g=window.gbar=window.gbar||{},l=window.gbar.i=window.gbar.i||{},m={},n;function _tvn(a,b){var c=parseInt(a,10);return isNaN(c)?b:c}function _tvf(a,b){var c=parseFloat(a);return isNaN(c)?b:c}function _tvv(a){return!!a}function p(a,b,c){(c||g)[a]=b}g.bv={n:_tvn("2",0),r:"",f:".67.",e:"0",m:_tvn("0",1)};

The system maintains first databases of patents, and second databases of non-patent information of interest to a corporate entity. The system also maintains one or more groups. Each of the groups comprises any number of the patents from the first databases. The system, upon receiving appropriate operator commands, automatically processes the patents in one of the groups in conjunction with non-patent information from the second databases. Accordingly, the system performs patent-centric and group-oriented processing of data. A group can also include any number of non-patent documents. The groups may be product based, person based, corporate entity based, or user-defined. Other types of groups are also covered, such as temporary groups. The processing automatically performed by the system relates to (but is not limited to) patent mapping, document mapping, patent citation (both forward and backward), patent aging, patent bracketing/clustering (both forward and backward), inventor patent count, inventor employment information, and finance. Other functions are also covered.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention is generally related to tools for data processing, and more particularly related to tools for patent-centric and group-oriented data processing.</p>
    <p>2. Related Art</p>
    <p>Patents are becoming more and more important to a business's success, especially in today's global economy. Patents can be viewed as a new type of currency in this global economy because they grant the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the patented technology. In some industries, product turnover is fairly rapid. However, core technology, product features, and markets change at a much slower rate. Accordingly, even in fast-moving industries, patents which cover core technology are very valuable at protecting a company's research and development investment for an extended period of time.</p>
    <p>Patents are also valuable as revenue generators. In 1993, for example, the revenue generated from patents by U.S. companies was over $60 billion. Fred Warshofsky, The Patent Wars, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. These patent revenue dollars are rising each year.</p>
    <p>Patents are further valuable because they collectively represent a vast technological database. Much of this database is only available as issued patents (i.e., it is not released in any other form). According to Larry Kahaner's book, Competitive Intelligence, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996, "More than 75 percent of the information contained in U.S. patents is never released anywhere else."</p>
    <p>If corporations searched this database before developing and releasing new products they might be able to avoid costly patent infringement litigation. Often, however, corporations do not conduct such patent searches. One significant reason for this is the difficulty in identifying relevant patents, and the difficulty in analyzing patents. Computerized search tools are becoming available to the public, such as web sites on the Internet, that can be used to conduct patent searches. Many companies and practitioners are reluctant to use such tools, however, due to the concern that their highly sensitive patent searches will not be maintained in confidence when using such tools.</p>
    <p>More and more corporations are recognizing the value of patents. The number of patents applied for and issued to U.S. companies is increasing every year, especially in fast moving industries such as computer software and biotechnology. Many international companies have also recognized the value of patents. In fact, foreign companies regularly rank among the leaders in issued U.S. patents.</p>
    <p>Of course, not all patents are as valuable to the patent owner or patent licensees as others. Some owned or licensed patents provide little or no value to the corporate entity. These patents become a drain on corporate resources, both in obtaining the patents, paying maintenance fees, and paying license fees. It is difficult for corporations to assess the value of their patents because automated tools for patent analysis do not exist.</p>
    <p>Yet, for all the heightened awareness being paid to patents in some quarters, patents remain one of the most underutilized assets in a company's portfolio. This is due, at least in significant part, to the fact that patent analysis, whether for purposes of licensing, infringement, enforcement, freedom to operate, technical research, product development, etc., is a very difficult, tedious, time consuming, and expensive task, particularly when performed with paper copies of patents.</p>
    <p>Software providers have been slow in developing software tools for aiding in the patent analysis process. As a result, there are few automated tools for patent analysis currently available. There are software tools available for managing corporate patent prosecution and payment of maintenance fees, such as products from Master Data Corporation. The patent analysis capabilities of these tools are limited. These tools, for example, cannot be used to facilitate the analysis and development of business strategies to increase corporate shareholder value through the strategic and tactical use of patents.</p>
    <p>A number of patent searching tools are available, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Automated Patent System (APS), and the on-line search services offered by Lexis and Westlaw. Other providers of patent information and patent search tools include Derwent, MicroPatent, Questel, Corporate Intelligence, STN, IFI/Plenum, The Shadow Patent Office (EDS), IBM, and CAS. These tools are not analysis tools. Instead, they are search tools. These tools enable a user to identify patents that satisfy a specified key word search criteria. In essence, these tools provide the user with the ability to possibly find "the needle-in-the-haystack." However, these tools have limited, if any, automated functions to aid a user in analyzing the patents, whether the company's own patents or those of competitors, for the purpose of making tactical and strategic business decisions based on the patents.</p>
    <p>SmartPatents Inc. (SPI) of Mountain View, Calif., provides electronic tools for analyzing patents. These tools, collectively called the SmartPatent Workbench, are very useful for analyzing patents. With the SmartPatent Workbench, a user can view the text and image of a patent, conduct text searches in the patent, copy and paste portions of the patent to other documents, build a case of patents, annotate the case and the patents in the case, import and export patents and cases, etc. The SmartPatent Workbench is commercially available from SPI, and is described in a number of publicly available documents, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,679 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,681, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <p>The SmartPatent Workbench is a patent analysis tool. The SmartPatent Workbench is primarily designed to assist a user in working with a single patent or a small collection of patents at a time. However, there are many instances when it would be very beneficial to be able to automatically and simultaneously analyze, correlate, or otherwise process multiple patents.</p>
    <p>For example, in some instances it would be beneficial to automatically analyze the inventorship of a collection of patents. More particularly, it would be beneficial to identify the persons who are named most frequently on a collection of patents. It would be very useful if this task could be performed automatically. However, no existing software tools can perform this task automatically.</p>
    <p>For the most part, existing patent-related tools can process only the information contained in patents. (It is noted, however, that the SmartPatent Workbench has functions to annotate patents with any information, whether or not patent related, and has additional functions to search within annotations.) These tools do not have functions for correlating, analyzing, and otherwise processing patent-related information with non-patent related information, including but not limited to corporate operational data, financial information, production information, human resources information, and other types of corporate information. Such non-patent information is critically important when evaluating the full strategic and tactical value and applicability of any given patent, or developing a corporate patent business strategy for gaining competitive advantage and increasing shareholder value based on patents.</p>
    <p>Consider, for example, FIG. 1. A typical corporation 102 includes a research and development (R&amp;D) department 104, a finance department 112, a manufacturing department 108, and a legal department 116 (that includes a licensing department 122 and a patent department 124). In the course of performing their respective duties, these departments generate, collect, and maintain information, such as R&amp;D information 106, financial information 114, manufacturing information 110 (such as bill of material information), licensing information 118, and patent information 120 (that includes the patents obtained by the company, and perhaps patents obtained by competitors).</p>
    <p>A business analyst 126 may be assigned the job of evaluating the value of the corporation's patent portfolio (represented as part of the patent information 120). In order to fully and accurately analyze the value and applicability of the corporation's patent portfolio, the analyst 126 should ideally take into account non-patent information, such as R&amp;D information 106, financial information 114, manufacturing information 110, and licensing information 118.</p>
    <p>For example, a patent's value may be linked to whether it covers technology that the corporation is currently using, or that the corporation may use in the future. Thus, an analysis of the patent should include an analysis of and correlation with manufacturing information 110 and R&amp;D information 106. Also, a patent's value may be linked to whether it has generated licensing revenue. Thus, an analysis of the patent should include an analysis of and correlation with licensing information 118. Further, a patent's value may be linked to the degree of success of the corporation's commercial products that correspond to the patent (i.e., the commercial embodiments of the patented technology). Thus, an analysis of the patent should include an analysis of and correlation with financial information 114.</p>
    <p>The processing described above, however, is usually not done (or it is done in an ad hoc, unorganized, incomplete, inefficient, and/or ineffective manner) because it is difficult or, in many cases, impossible to manually collect, organize, correlate, and process all of the information pertinent to the patents under study. Often times, it is a difficult or even impossible task to simply identify the relevant patents. Accordingly, it would be very beneficial to have automated tools that automatically process patent-related information and non-patent related information for making corporate business decisions. Existing patent-related tools do not have this capability.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Briefly stated, the present invention is directed to a system, method, and computer program product for processing data. The present invention maintains first databases of patents, and second databases of non-patent information of interest to a corporate entity.</p>
    <p>The present invention also maintains one or more groups. Each of the groups comprises any number of patents from the first databases. The present invention, upon receiving appropriate operator commands, automatically processes the patents in one or more of the groups in conjunction with non-patent information from the second databases. Accordingly, the present invention performs patent-centric and group-oriented processing of data.</p>
    <p>A group can also include any number of non-patent documents.</p>
    <p>The groups may be defined by the business practices of the corporation and could include groupings that are product based, person based, corporate entity based, or user-defined. Other types of groups also fall within the scope of the invention. For example, the invention supports temporary groups that are automatically generated in the course of the automatic processing performed by the invention.</p>
    <p>The processing automatically performed by the invention relates to (but is not limited to) patent mapping, document mapping, document/patent citation (both forward and backward), document/patent aging, patent bracketing/clustering (both forward and backward), inventor patent count, inventor employment information, and finance. Other functions also fall within the scope of the invention.</p>

    <p>Overview of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention is directed to a system, components of the system, a method, components of the method, and a computer program product for patent-centric and group-oriented data processing. Such processing includes, but is not limited to, reporting, analyzing, and planning.</p>
    <p>The present invention is intended to aid a corporate entity in developing business-related strategies, plans, and actions. Accordingly, the present invention is also referred to herein as a business decision system and method.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 is a conceptual representation of the invention. The present invention processes patent information 204, which is herein defined to include (but not limited to) U.S. and non-U.S. patents (text and/or images) and post issuance documents (such as Certificates of Correction), and patent-related information, which includes information about patents (herein called patent bibliographic information). Accordingly, the processing performed by the invention is said to be "patent-centric" or "patent-specific."</p>
    <p>More generally, the present invention processes any documents, some of which are related to patents, and others which are unrelated to patents. These documents are preferably of interest to a business entity, and include contracts, licenses, leases, notes, commercial papers, other legal and/or financial papers, etc., as well as patents.</p>
    <p>For illustrative purposes, the invention is often described herein with respect to patents. However, it should be understood that the invention is also applicable to all types of documents, and the structures, functions, and operations described herein are applicable to all types of documents, whether patent or non-patent.</p>
    <p>The present invention also processes other information, preferably business-related information, including (but not limited to) research and development (R&amp;D) information 206, financial information 216, patent licensing information 214, manufacturing information 208, and other relevant business information 210 (which may, for example, include human resources information). This other information is generally called non-patent information (since it includes documents other than patents and may further include information from operational and non-operational corporate databases).</p>
    <p>The present invention is adapted to maintain and process massive amounts of documents (several hundred thousand or more). It is often necessary to maintain and process this large number of documents in order to develop strategic, patent-related business plans for the customer.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, processing of the patent information 204 can be conducted either with or without consideration of any of the other information 206, 216, 214, 210, 208.</p>
    <p>For example, a user 212 (who may be a business analyst) may be assigned the job of evaluating the value of the corporation's patent portfolio (represented as part of the patent information 204). In order to fully analyze the value and applicability of the corporation's patent portfolio, the user 212 must take into account other information, such as R&amp;D information 206, financial information 216, manufacturing information 208, and licensing information 214, for both the corporation and its competitors.</p>
    <p>For example, a patent's value may be linked to whether it covers technology that the corporation is currently using, or that the corporation may use in the future. For this and other purposes, the present invention includes functions for automatically analyzing the patent information 204 in conjunction with manufacturing information 208 and/or R&amp;D information 206. Also, a patent's value may be linked to whether it has generated licensing revenue. For this and other purposes, the present invention includes functions for automatically analyzing the patent information 204 in conjunction with the licensing information 214. Further, a patent's value may be linked to the degree of success of the corporation's commercial products related to the patent (i.e., the commercial embodiments of the patented technology). For this and other purposes, the present invention includes functions for automatically analyzing the patent information 204 in conjunction with the financial information 216.</p>
    <p>The invention could also be used to determine the value of a corporate entity's patent portfolio for purposes of a merger or acquisition. The invention could also be used in a merger or acquisition context to determine a corporate entity's business direction. For example, if Company A is interested in acquiring Company B, Company A could use the invention to categorize all of Company B's patents into groups. The nature of these groups would be an indication of the types of work that Company B is involved in. Other uses of the invention are described below. Further uses of the invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the discussion contained herein.</p>
    <p>The present invention is group enabled. According to the present invention, a group is a data structure that includes a collection of patents. The patents in a group typically follow a common theme or characteristic (although this is not a mandatory requirement of groups). For example, a first group may include patents that map to a product being manufactured and sold by a company. A second group may include patents that map to a product or product feature being considered for future manufacture and sale by a company. A third group may include patents owned by a corporate entity. A fourth group may include patents each having a particular person named as an inventor. A fifth group may include patents owned by a competitor. A sixth group may include patents related to a research project. A seventh group may include licensed patents. An eighth group may include patents and/or non-patent documents related to a litigation in which the customer is involved or has an interest (such a group is also herein called a case). A ninth group may include patents and other documents arbitrarily selected by a customer.</p>
    <p>The present invention is capable of automatically processing the patents in a group, or the patents in multiple groups (alternatively, the invention can automatically process a single patent). Accordingly, the present invention is said to support "group-oriented" data processing.</p>
    <p>Being able to automatically process information on a group basis is a very important feature of the invention, and proves to be very valuable and useful. Consider the above example of FIG. 2, where the user 212 has the task of evaluating the value of the corporation's patent portfolio. Suppose that the corporation has two products on the market, Product A and Product B. Product A generated $10 million in revenue, and Product B generated $30 million in revenue. The corporation has 5 patents that map to Product A, and 3 patents that map to Product B. If the user 212 analyzes this data without regard to groups, then the user 212 will find that the corporation's revenue per patent is $5 million. That is, for every $5 million in revenue, the corporation obtains a patent. Suppose that a relevant industry benchmark indicates that a company should obtain a patent for every $6 million of revenue. According to this scenario, the user 212 will conclude that the corporation is potentially seeking greater patent protection than the industry benchmark with respect to its technology.</p>
    <p>Consider, now, the scenario where the user 212 analyzes the data with regard to groups, in this case a first group composed of patents that map to Product A, and a second group composed of patents that map to Product B. The user 212 will find that corporation's revenue per patent is $2 million for the first group (i.e., patents that map to Product A), and $10 million for the second group (i.e., patents that map to Product B). According to this scenario, the user 212 will conclude that the corporation is potentially devoting too much of its patent-related resources with respect to its technology related to Product A (it is "overpatenting" technology related to Product A), and potentially devoting too little of its patent-related resources with respect to its technology related to Product B (it is "underpatenting" technology related to Product B).</p>
    <p>In addition, an analysis of the patents relative to a product may indicate that the core features or technology of the product are not patented and, thus, could be freely and legally copied by a competitor. This could adversely affect the product's price floor and revenue stream. With this information in hand, the company could then take steps to more comprehensively patent its technology (or make a conscious and knowledgeable decision to not seek further patent protection). Without group-oriented processing of the patents related to the product, this information is unavailable. Without this information, the company is more likely to make unwise and costly business decisions.</p>
    <p>As indicated by the above example, group-oriented processing yields information on a scale whose granularity is defined by the definition of the group. The information produced by group-oriented processing is specific to the patents in the group. Accordingly, as with the above example, group-oriented processing is often more useful and more illuminating than non-group-processing.</p>
    <p>Also, the invention supports hierarchically structured groups. The invention, in performing a function requested by the operator, may identify a particular group. Such identification of this group may yield very useful information, as apparent from the above example. This group, however, may have a number of parent and/or child groups. The operator may be able to uncover additional useful data by viewing, analyzing, and/or processing these parent and child groups, either with or without the original group.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, the invention supports and facilitates "data drilling" and/or "data mining."</p>
    <p>As noted above, according to the present invention, processing of the patent information 204 is conducted with consideration of other information 206, 216, 214, 210, 209, called non-patent information. The process of assigning patents to groups is an example of processing patent information with non-patent information. This is the case, because groups are often created according to non-patent considerations. Accordingly, any subsequent processing of the patents in a group involve, by definition, non-patent considerations.</p>
    <p>For example, the customer may create groups to represent its products. In this case, the groups are created according to the customer's production information. In another example, the customer may create groups to represent persons of interest. In this case, the groups are created according to HR (human resources) information. In another example, the customer may create groups to represent its competitors. In this case, the groups are created according to business information or practices. In another example, the customer may create groups based on its future products or feature requirement. In this case, the groups are created according to its R&amp;D information.</p>
    <p>All of these groups are created based on or in consideration of non-patent information, not patent information. Accordingly, any subsequent group processing of the patents contained in any of these groups represents, by definition, processing of the patent information 204 with consideration of, or in conjunction with, or based on non-patent information 206, 216, 214, 210, 208. This is the case, even if such subsequent group processing involves only, for example, patent bibliographic information (i.e., patent information), such as group processing based on patent issue dates or group processing based on patent references, since the groups being processed were created based on or in consideration of non-patent information, including non-patent information 206, 216, 214, 210, 208.</p>
    <p>A group may also contain non-patent documents. In fact, a group may contain only non-patent documents. Accordingly, a group is more generally defined as a collection of documents (such as patent documents only, non-patent documents only, or a combination of patent and non-patent documents). The documents in a group typically follow a common theme or characteristic (although this is not a mandatory requirement of groups). Referring to FIG. 2, the invention processes document information 204 alone, or in conjunction with other information 206, 216, 214, 210, 208 (which may or may not be related to the documents). Accordingly, the processing performed by the present invention is more generally described as being document-centric and group-oriented.</p>
    <p>Components of the Invention</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a system 302 according to an embodiment of the invention. The system 302 includes a plurality of databases 316 that store patent information and other information, such as R&amp;D (research and development) information, financial information, licensing information, manufacturing information, HR (human resources) information, and any other information that may be pertinent to the analysis of the patent information. The terms "database" and "table" are used synonymously herein.</p>
    <p>An enterprise server 314 accesses and processes the information in the databases 316. In particular, the enterprise server 314 includes modules that are capable of automatically accessing and processing the information in the databases 316 in a patent-centric (or document-centric) and group-oriented manner. These modules are also capable of automatically accessing and processing the information in the databases on a patent by patent basis ("one patent at a time"). Such processing includes, but is not limited to, reporting, analyzing, and planning.</p>
    <p>The enterprise server 314 may be a single physical server, or may be a hierarchy of multiple servers 502, 504, 506, 508. An example of this multiple server embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 5. A given client 304, 306 may also connect to one or multiple servers. As is well known, in a client/server environment, some work is done by the client, some work is done by the server, and data flows between the client and the server.</p>
    <p>The system 302 preferably includes two types of clients, network clients 306 and web clients 304. These clients 304, 306, pursuant to instructions from human operators or users (not shown), interact with the enterprise server 314 to access and process the information in the databases 316. For example, the clients 304, 306 may request that the enterprise server 314 retrieve certain information, or automatically analyze certain information. The enterprise server 314 performs the requested tasks, and sends the results to the requesting clients 304, 306. The clients 304, 306 present these results to their respective operators, and enable the operators to process the results.</p>
    <p>Clients 304, 306 may also perform additional processing of data, such as creating a visualization of the data obtained from the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, the network clients 306 preferably communicate with the enterprise server 314 using the enterprise server 314's natural language, which is called the enterprise server API (described in detail below). Accordingly, the network clients 306 communicate directly with the enterprise server 314 via a communication network 312, which is preferably a network that uses the well known HTTP (hypertext transport) protocol. Other protocols could alternatively be used. This network 312 may be of any size, such as (but not limited to) a local area network or a wide area network (it can even be a global network).</p>
    <p>The web clients 304 do not preferably utilize the enterprise server 314's natural language. Accordingly, the web clients 304 communicate with the enterprise server 314 via a web server 310, which translates between the language of the web clients 304 and the language of the enterprise server 314. This translation is described below.</p>
    <p>In an embodiment of the present invention, the components of the present invention shown in FIG. 3 are implemented using well known computers, such as a computer 1102 shown in FIG. 11. The computer 1102 can be any commercially available and well known computer capable of performing the functions described herein, such as computers available from International Business Machines, Apple, Silicon Graphics Inc., Sun, HP, Dell, Compaq, Digital, Cray, etc.</p>
    <p>The computer 1102 includes one or more processors (also called central processing units, or CPUs), such as a processor 1106. The processor 1106 is connected to a communication bus 1104. The computer 1102 also includes a main or primary memory 1108, preferably random access memory (RAM). The primary memory 1108 has stored therein control logic 1110 (computer software), and data 1112.</p>
    <p>The computer 1102 also includes one or more secondary storage devices 1114. The secondary storage devices 1114 include, for example, a hard disk drive 1116 and/or a removable storage device or drive 1118. The removable storage drive 1118 represents a floppy disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, a compact disk drive, an optical storage device, tape backup, ZIP drive, JAZZ drive, etc.</p>
    <p>The removable storage drive 1118 interacts with a removable storage unit 1120. As will be appreciated, the removable storage unit 1120 includes a computer usable or readable storage medium having stored therein computer software (control logic) and/or data. The removable storage drive 1118 reads from and/or writes to the removable storage unit 1120 in a well known manner.</p>
    <p>Removable storage unit 1120, also called a program storage device or a computer program product, represents a floppy disk, magnetic tape, compact disk, optical storage disk, ZIP disk, JAZZ disk/tape, or any other computer data storage device. Program storage devices or computer program products also include any device in which computer programs can be stored, such as hard drives.</p>
    <p>In an embodiment, the present invention is directed to computer program products or program storage devices having software that enables the computer 1102 to perform any combination of the functions described herein.</p>
    <p>Computer programs (also called computer control logic) are stored in main memory 1108 and/or the secondary storage devices 1114. Such computer programs, when executed, enable the computer 1102 to perform the functions of the present invention as discussed herein. In particular, the computer programs, when executed, enable the processor 1106 to perform the functions of the present invention. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controllers of the computer 1102.</p>
    <p>The modules of the invention discussed herein, such as the grouping module 412, the analysis modules 416, etc., preferably represent software executing in the computer 1102.</p>
    <p>The computer 1102 also includes a display unit 1122, such as a computer monitor, and one or more input devices 1124, such as a keyboard, a mouse, other pointing devices (such as a light pen and trackball), etc.</p>
    <p>The computer 1102 further includes a communication or network interface 1126. The network interface 1126 enables the computer 1102 to communicate over communication networks, such as networks 308 and 312, which preferably use the well known HTTP communication protocol.</p>
    <p>The components of the invention (shown in FIG. 3) are described in greater detail below. It should be understood that any specific software, hardware, or operating system implementations described herein are provided for purposes of illustration, and not limitation. The invention can work with software, hardware, and operating system implementations other than those described herein. Any software, hardware, and operating system implementations suitable for performing the functions described herein can be used.</p>
    <p>Customer Corporate Entity</p>
    <p>Preferably, the system 302 is adapted for use by a particular customer. Typically, the customer is a corporate entity. Accordingly, the customer is also called herein the customer corporate entity.</p>
    <p>It should be understood, however, that the customer can be any organization or individual, such as an academic institution, a research organization, a non-profit or for-profit organization, or any person. Generally, the customer is any entity having an interest in patents.</p>
    <p>The customer is an entity (such as a company) that has arranged to have use of the system 302 (by purchasing, leasing, or renting the system 302, for example).</p>
    <p>The databases 316 and data contained therein are specific to the customer. For example, the databases 316 may contain information on the patents that the customer owns and/or licensees, and information on the patents that the customer's competitors owns and/or licenses. Also, the databases 316 may contain the customer's and the customer's competitors' R&amp;D information, financial information, licensing information, manufacturing information, and HR information.</p>
    <p>Also, the methodology functions supported by the enterprise server 314 may be specialized or augmented to meet the needs of the customer.</p>
    <p>Implementation and use of the present invention may involve a number of persons associated with the customer corporate entity, such as employees, consultants, associates, and persons retained by the customer, such as attorneys. When interacting with the invention, these people are called operators or users. Table 1 lists some of such persons and their respective responsibilities according to an embodiment of the invention. These persons may be involved in all aspects of the invention for the customer, or may be involved in only some phases of the invention for the customer, such as the extract and load of the databases 316. It should be noted that the set up and use of the invention may also involve other people with different knowledge, skills, and/or abilities.</p>
    <p>In the discussion contained herein, reference is often made to a user or an operator associated with the customer. It should be understood that the terms "user" and "operator" are synonymous, and refer to one or more persons from Table 1.</p>

    <p>Databases</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 illustrates the databases 316. According to the present invention, the databases 316 store document information (that includes patent information) and information pertinent to the analysis of the document information.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 illustrates a particular embodiment of the databases 316, and also illustrates a particular embodiment of the types of tables that the databases 316 contain, and the attributes in the tables. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the particular database embodiment of FIG. 6. Instead, the invention is adapted and intended to cover other database structures and organizations that are capable of storing document information and information pertinent to the analysis of the document information. The particular information that is stored in the databases is implementation dependent and varies based on a number of factors, including the type of analysis that is desired, the specific needs of the customer, the type and content of the information that the customer maintains, etc.</p>
    <p>The databases 316 of FIG. 6 are collectively called methodology databases, and the data within them are called methodology data, because they support the functions and features, or the methodology, of the present invention. These functions and features (generically called methodology functions and features) are described in sections below.</p>
    <p>Many of the databases 316, such as the BOM databases 626, the inventor databases 628, and corporate entity databases 630, the financial databases 638, the person databases 632, and the employee databases 634, are initially loaded using information provided by the customer. Such information includes R&amp;D (research and development) information, financial information, licensing information, manufacturing information, HR (human resources) information, and any other information that may be pertinent to the analysis of the customer's patents and other relevant documents. After initial loading, these databases 316 are updated as necessary to reflect changes in the customer's information.</p>
    <p>Other information, such as information for the patent bibliographic databases 604 and the patent database 614, may be loaded using information provided by a third party provider, such as a third party provider that specializes in the provision of patent information in electronic form. One such third party provider is SmartPatents Inc. (SPI) of Mountain View, Calif. The patent bibliographic databases 604 may be periodically updated through a subscription service from such third party providers. Similarly, the patent database 614 may be augmented through as-needed orders to the third party providers. It should be understood that the present invention works equally well with data provided by any party as long as the data's format matches the formats of the patent bibliographic databases 604 and the patent database 614.</p>
    <p>The databases 316 are described in greater detail below.</p>
    <p>Document Databases</p>
    <p>The document databases 612 preferably include electronic representations of documents of interest to the customer. The document databases 612 represent the customer's repository of documents, and are thus also called the customer's document repository. (The "repository" could alternatively represent all documents represented in the databases 316, whether represented in the document databases 612 or the bibliographic databases 602.)</p>
    <p>For example, the patent database 614 includes electronic representations of U.S. and foreign patents of interest to the customer. These patents may be patents owned and/or licensed by the customer, patents owned and/or licensed by competitors of the customer, patents that the customer is considering acquiring, patents that, for whatever reason, the customer is studying, etc. The patent database 614 represents the customer's repository of patents, and is thus also called (in some embodiments) the customer's patent repository.</p>
    <p>The patent database 614 preferably has stored therein an image file and a text file for each patent represented in the patent database 614, where the image file and the text file are representations of the patent. Details of an embodiment of the image file and the text file are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,681 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,679, which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
    <p>The document databases 612 also include electronic representations of other documents of interest to the customer, such as depositions, pleadings, and prior art references. These documents are respectively stored in a deposition database 618, a pleadings database 616 (generally, pleadings are papers filed with a court), and a prior art database 620. Text and/or image representations of these documents may be stored. These documents may be pertinent to a patent litigation that the customer is involved in.</p>
    <p>The documents in the document databases 612 may be text, images, graphics, audio, video, multimedia, and/or any other information representation that can be stored in electronic form.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the document databases 612 of FIG. 6 are shown for purposes of illustration, and not limitation. As mentioned above, the document databases 612 store electronic representations of documents that are of interest to the customer. Accordingly, the types of document databases 612 and the contents of the document databases 612 are, by definition, customer and implementation specific.</p>
    <p>Document Bibliographic Databases</p>
    <p>The document bibliographic databases 602 store information about documents (as opposed to the documents themselves). More particularly, the document bibliographic databases 602 store bibliographic information about documents.</p>
    <p>Patent Bibliographic Databases</p>
    <p>The patent bibliographic databases 604 store bibliographic data about U.S. and non-U.S. patents. Such patent bibliographic data includes, but is not limited to, the information on the front page of patents, such as: the patent number, the issue date, the inventors, the title, the assignee, the serial number, the filing date, the U.S. and international classifications, the fields of search, the references cited, the primary examiner, the assistant examiner, the attorney, the agent, the law firm, priority information, related application information, the number of claims, the number of drawing pages, the patent term, the expiration date, etc. The patent bibliographic databases 604 can also include one or more user defined fields that can store large amounts of data, such as 32 Kbytes or more of data.</p>
    <p>Operators can extend the bibliographic databases 602 in patent-centric ways. For example, a "current licensee" field can be added to the patent bibliographic databases 604. This could be accomplished, for example, by defining one of the user defined fields to be a current licensee field.</p>
    <p>In an embodiment of the invention, the patent bibliographic databases 604 store bibliographic information on all U.S. patents. In other embodiments of the invention, the patent bibliographic databases 604 store patent bibliographic information on a subset of all U.S. patents, such as all U.S. patents that are available in electronic form from the U.S. Patent Office, or all U.S. patents that issued after a certain date.</p>
    <p>Generally, there is not a one-to-one relationship between the patents in the patent database 614, and the patents represented in the patent bibliographic databases 604. That is, the patent database 614 does not generally include a copy of each patent represented in the patent bibliographic databases 604. Instead, the patent database 614 includes only those patents that are of interest to the customer. In contrast, the patent bibliographic databases 604 store bibliographic information on all U.S. patents and/or foreign patents (or, alternatively, all U.S. patents that issued after a certain date, and/or a subset of foreign patents). Of course, if the customer has an interest in all U.S. patents, such that electronic copies of all U.S. patents are stored in the patent database 614, then there would be a one-to-one relationship between the patents in the patent database 614, and the patents represented in the patent bibliographic databases 604.</p>
    <p>Other Document Bibliographic Databases</p>
    <p>The document bibliographic databases 602 include store bibliographic information on other types of documents that are of interest to the customer. For example, if the customer is interested in depositions, pleadings, or prior art references, then the document bibliographic databases 602 would store bibliographic information on depositions, pleadings, or prior art references in deposition bibliographic databases 606, pleadings bibliographic databases 608, and prior art bibliographic databases 610, respectively.</p>
    <p>The bibliographic information may include the parties or persons involved, the date of creation, the date of modification, the subject, the number of pages, the number of figures, etc. Such bibliographic information may be generated manually, and/or may be generated automatically during the generation of the source document. For example, word processing tools often automatically generate bibliographic information about a document as the document is being created. Such information may include the creator, the typist, the date of creation, the date of modification, the subject, the title, the type of document, the storage format, etc. This automatically-created bibliographic information could be loaded into the document bibliographic databases 602.</p>
    <p>Notes Database</p>
    <p>The present invention supports annotation of the documents in the document databases 612. More particularly, the present invention allows users to create and link annotations (also called notes) to any portions of the documents in the document databases 612. Such annotations can include text, graphics, images, video, audio, and/or any other information representation that can be stored in electronic form.</p>
    <p>The present invention also allows various information to be stored with annotations, such as the date of creation, the creator, the date of modification, a note title and/or subject, access rights, etc.</p>
    <p>The annotations, linkage information (i.e., information that specifies the link between a note and a portion of a document), and information related to the annotations and/or the linkage information (such as the position of the linked portion in the document, the date of creation, the creator, the date of modification, a note title and/or subject, access rights, etc.) are stored in the notes databases 640. Embodiments of the notes databases 640 are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,679 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,681, incorporated by reference herein, and in pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/590,082, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p>Groups Databases</p>
    <p>Information on groups is stored in the group databases 621. Generally, a group is a data structure that includes any number of documents that typically follow a common theme or characteristic (although this is not a mandatory requirement of groups). More particularly, a group is a data structure that includes any number of patents that typically follow a common theme or characteristic (although, again, this is not a mandatory requirement of groups). Groups are document-centric, or in many cases, patent-centric.</p>
    <p>There are two classes of groups: predefined groups (also called system defined groups) and user-defined groups (also called arbitrary groups).</p>
    <p>However, the invention also supports other types of groups. For example, the invention supports temporary groups. A temporary group is automatically created by the invention in the course of processing a command. One application of temporary groups involves search operations. Specifically, when conducting a search for documents, a new temporary group is created, and the search results are stored in the temporary group. The invention permits operators to convert temporary groups to predefined groups or user-defined groups.</p>
    <p>Patents (and/or documents) in predefined groups follow a predefined theme or characteristic. Database tables, fields, and attributes of a predefined group are specific to the predefined theme/characteristic of the predefined group. Accordingly, different predefined groups have different database tables, different database fields, and different database attributes. Information on predefined groups is stored in the predefined or system defined group databases 622.</p>
    <p>Patents (and/or documents) in user-defined groups may or may not follow a common theme or characteristic. Any theme or characteristic that they do follow is defined by the user. Accordingly, user-defined groups are also called arbitrary groups.</p>
    <p>All user-defined groups have the same, generic database tables, fields, and attributes. However, users may elect to use these database tables, fields and attributes differently for different user-defined groups. Information on user-defined groups is stored in the user-defined group databases 624.</p>
    <p>Predefined groups can be more powerful than user-defined groups for at least two reasons. First, the databases associated with a predefined group store information that is specific to the predefined characteristics of the predefined group. As a result, more useful and specific information can be stored in predefined groups. Second, since the data attributes and characteristics of predefined groups are known in advance, specific functions can be generated in advance to automatically process the information associated with predefined groups. As a result, the information associated with predefined groups can be automatically processed in powerful and diverse ways that are useful given the attributes and characteristics of the predefined groups.</p>
    <p>The tables and attributes of predefined groups are typically not applicable to other types of groups. In contrast, the tables and attributes of user-defined groups are generic, and are applicable to all groups. Thus, user-defined groups are more flexible than predefined groups.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, in practice, a user-defined group is used by a customer until its attributes, characteristics, and functions are well defined. Once they are well defined, a new predefined group is created to replace the user-defined group. This new predefined group is designed to encompass and take advantage of the specific attributes, characteristics, and functions of the group. In other words, this new predefined group is designed to encompass and take advantage of the well defined structure of the group. Then, analysis and reporting modules are created which automatically analyze and report on the data in the new predefined group. It is possible to create such analysis and reporting modules specific to the new predefined group because of the well defined structure of the new predefined group. The new predefined groups and their reporting and analysis modules can then be distributed (i.e., its databases and functional modules can then be distributed) to interested customers of the invention.</p>
    <p>The scope of the present invention includes the creation of new predefined groups and their reporting and analysis functions in the manner described above. The scope of the present invention also includes such new predefined groups and their reporting and analysis functions. The structure and operation of such new predefined groups and their reporting and analysis functions are implementation dependent, but would be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the discussion contained herein.</p>
    <p>In the present invention, groups are structured. Specifically, groups are organized into a directed, acyclic graph, where a group can have multiple children groups and multiple parent groups.</p>
    <p>The system of the invention discourages or prevents non-sensical organizations of groups. Such non-sensical organizations of groups is at least partially discouraged or prevented by the automatic functions performed by the invention. For example, the system discourages or prevents making a corporate entity group a child of a BOM group, since running an analysis report on all of the subassemblies of the BOM group would yield questionable or undefined results since a corporate entity does not have subassemblies. In an embodiment of the invention, such non-sensical organization of groups is prevented by computer programming.</p>
    <p>Also, when a specialized (predefined) group is created to perform specialized analysis functions, new restrictions regarding the rules that govern the inter-relationships between groups are also created. The rules manifest themselves in the database schema. The database schema of the invention prevents the creation of non-sensical group relationships.</p>
    <p>Predefined Groups Databases</p>
    <p>Various predefined groups are described below. It should be understood that the following represents examples of predefined groups supported by the invention. The invention is adapted and intended to include other predefined groups. As described above, predefined groups are often created from user-defined groups once the attributes, characteristics, and functions of the user-defined groups are well defined. The invention is adapted and intended to include these types of predefined groups. Accordingly, the following is provided for purposes of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>Bill of Materials (BOM) Databases</p>
    <p>A BOM (bill of materials) group is a group that contains patents (and perhaps other documents) that map to a product, or that map to parts of a product. More particularly, a BOM group is a group that contains patents that map to an assembly, a subassembly, or a part, where an assembly is composed of one or more subassemblies, and a subassembly is composed of other subassemblies and/or parts.</p>
    <p>The phrase "a patent maps to a product" means that the patent includes claims that appear to read on the product or process of making and/or using the product, and/or includes claims that are related to or relevant to the product or process of making and/or using the product, and/or that the patent discloses subject matter than encompasses the product or process of making and/or using the product, and/or that the patent discloses subject matter than is related to or relevant to the product or process of making and/or using the product.</p>
    <p>Information on BOM groups is stored in the BOM databases 626. BOM groups and the BOM databases 626 are discussed in greater detail in sections below.</p>
    <p>Corporate Entity Databases</p>
    <p>A corporate entity group is a group that contains patents (or other documents) that are owned, licensed, or otherwise of interest to a corporate entity. Information on corporate entity groups is stored in corporate entity databases 630. The corporate entity databases 630 can include information on any number of corporate entity groups. Such corporate entity groups can correspond to any corporate entities that are of interest to the customer, such as the customer itself, affiliates of the customer, competitors of the customer, etc. Corporate entity groups and the corporate entity databases 630 are discussed in greater detail in sections below.</p>
    <p>Inventor Databases (and Employees and Person Databases)</p>
    <p>An inventor group is a group that contains patents each of which name as inventor a particular person. Information on inventor groups is stored in inventor databases 628. The inventor databases 628 are supported by person databases 632, which include information on people of interest to the customer (people who play a role in the processing of the invention, such as an inventor or employee), and employee databases 634, which include information on employees of interest to the customer. Inventor groups, the inventor databases 628, the employee databases 634, and the person databases 632 are discussed in greater detail in sections below.</p>
    <p>User-Defined Group Databases</p>
    <p>A user-defined group is a data structure that contains documents that follow some user-defined theme or characteristic. Information on user-defined groups is stored in the user-defined group databases 624.</p>
    <p>These user-defined group databases 624 are common to all user-defined groups. In particular, the attributes in these user-defined group databases 624 are the same for all user-defined groups. However, the customer can choose to utilize these attributes differently for each user-defined group. For example, the customer may choose to store different types of data in these attributes for different user-defined groups. User-defined groups and the user-defined group databases 624 are discussed in greater detail in sections below.</p>
    <p>Financial Databases</p>
    <p>The financial databases 638 store financial information pertaining to the customer's business. The financial databases 638 may also include financial information on competitors' businesses (to the extent that such information is publicly known, or can be determined or estimated based on publicly known information or business practices). Such financial information may include money spent on R&amp;D on a product line basis, gross and net revenue on a product line basis, patent licensing revenue, patent acquisition costs, etc. The invention correlates and analyzes the information in the financial databases 638 with patent information to determine, among other things, the financial impact of patents on the customer's and competitors' respective businesses. The financial databases 638 are discussed in greater detail in sections below.</p>
    <p>Security Database</p>
    <p>The present invention includes multileveled security features for limiting access to data stored in the databases 316. Security is defined herein as privilege levels associated with operators and data objects, and a security methodology for applying the privilege levels so as to restrict access to the data objects to operators having the appropriate privilege levels.</p>
    <p>The invention is capable of supporting security for all data items, including security for notes (stored in the notes databases 640), groups (stored in the group databases 621), financial information (stored in the financial databases 638), personal information (stored in the person databases 632 and the employee databases 634), and documents (stored in the document databases 612 and the document bibliographic databases 602). Information for implementing these security features is stored in the security databases 636, which are discussed in greater detail in sections below.</p>
    <p>Enterprise Server</p>
    <p>The enterprise server 314 is preferably implemented as one or more computers (such as the computer 1102 shown in FIG. 11) each having at least 128 MBytes of main memory 1108 and running Microsoft Windows NT. The enterprise server 314 could, alternatively, be implemented using other memory configurations, and other operating systems, such as (but not limited to) UNIX, Windows 95, MS-DOS, the Apple Operating System, etc. Accordingly, the specific hardware and software implementations discussed herein are provided for purposes of illustration, not limitation (this applies to all specific hardware and software implementations discussed herein, both for the enterprise server 314 and for other components of the invention). The invention can utilize any hardware, software, and operating system capable of performing the functions described herein.</p>
    <p>The enterprise server 314 can be a single computer, or a hierarchy of multiple computers (FIG. 5). Logically, however, the enterprise server 314 is preferably a single computer.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 is a logical block diagram of the enterprise server 314. The enterprise server 314 has a number of modules (collectively called the enterprise server modules). Note that a number of the modules interact with the databases 316. A SQL server 426 (such as the Microsoft SQL Server) and/or other well known database servers 428 interact directly with the databases 316. The enterprise server modules interact with these servers 426 and 428 and the databases 316 via a database interface module 420, which preferably represents an ODBC (object database connectivity) layer.</p>
    <p>The Network transport layer or interface 401 is used to receive command request objects from the client 304, 306 based on a specific network protocol, preferably HTTP. On the enterprise server 314 these network command objects are reconstructed from a stream of bits received from the client 304, 306. Once the command objects have been reconstructed the specific operations (described herein) defined in this object are performed by the appropriate enterprise server modules. The command objects represent enterprise server API commands, discussed below.</p>
    <p>According to an embodiment of the invention, command objects include autonomous intelligent agents that perform appropriate operations at the enterprise server 314 on behalf of the operator (i.e., the client 304, 306). In this embodiment, the command objects sent to the enterprise server 314 represent computer programs that are executed in the enterprise server 314. These executing computer programs preferably represent threads each having an address space. These computer programs, when executing in the enterprise server 314, perform the functions discussed herein, such as patent mapping, patent aging, inventor count, inventor information, financial functions, etc.</p>
    <p>The enterprise server 314 is a highly secure business decision system. The specific operations in each command object are checked against the security information maintained about each user in the system. This is logically done through a comprehensive security layer or module 402. (The specific implementation of security requires the interaction with ODBC 420, as all security information is stored in the databases 316). Alternatively, the security module 402 could logically be shown as being under the server configuration module 404 and the command dispatch module 406.</p>
    <p>As described elsewhere herein, the document storage and retrieval module 408 is part of a Virtual Patent System 11304 (FIG. 113) that presents a consistent, unified view of an arbitrary number of patent and patent-related documents.</p>
    <p>The Searching subsystem or module 410 provides for patent searching using a search language (syntax) described below, an extensible language for searching patent and other patent-related documents. The search layer 410 also encapsulates the specific search engine 424 used in the implementation of the system, which can and will vary based on available search technologies.</p>
    <p>The other layers shown in FIG. 4 work together to form the heart of the business decision system of the present invention. The Groups layer or grouping module 412 is responsible for managing all groups created by a user in support of patent analysis. The Notes layer or module 414 is responsible for managing all forms of annotations made by the user. The Analysis Queries layer or analysis modules 416 perform analysis queries in support of specific requests made by various modules in the decision support system. Finally, the server administration layer or module 418 provides services to manage the configuration of the enterprise server 314, such as adding or changing the security permissions associated with a specific user.</p>
    <p>Each of these layers provides a mechanism to further decouple the operation of the enterprise server 314 from the specific implementation of the databases 316. Each of these layers also interact with ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) 420, a Microsoft defined industry standard mechanism for manipulating relational databases (other software for interacting with and manipulating databases could alternatively be used). ODBC 420 provides a final layer of decoupling and enables the enterprise server 314 to transparently connect to different relational databases 316.</p>
    <p>The enterprise server modules are further described below.</p>
    <p>Document Storage and Retrieval Module</p>
    <p>The document storage and retrieval module 408 in the enterprise server 314 stores and retrieves documents from the document databases 612. Preferably, especially with respect to patent documents, the document storage and retrieval module 408 stores and retrieves text files and image files representative of documents in the document databases 612. The document storage and retrieval module 408 performs such data storage and retrieval operations pursuant to commands that conform to the enterprise server API, described below.</p>
    <p>The document storage and retrieval module 408 preferably interacts directly with the operating system 422 of the enterprise server 314, where such direct interaction primarily pertains to data retrieval and storage.</p>
    <p>As just noted, the document storage and retrieval module 408 operates to access data in the document databases 612, such as the customer's repository of patents represented by the patent database 614. Preferably, the patent database 614 stores electronic representations of all patents which are of interest to the customer. Additional electronic patents can be added to the patent database 614 at any time as the customer's interests change. The patent database 614 is capable of storing electronic representations of all U.S. patents, or any subset of all U.S. patents, and of any number of foreign patents as required by the customer's needs and interests. Accordingly, the document storage and retrieval module 408, in combination with the patent database 614 and the patent bibliographic databases 604, provide the customer with the ability to quickly, efficiently, and effectively access, display, and process any patent of interest. Accordingly, from the perspective of the client, the document storage and retrieval module 408, in combination with the patent database 614 and the patent bibliographic databases 604, represent a virtual patent system. FIG. 113 graphically depicts this virtual patent system 11304.</p>
    <p>The client document storage and retrieval module 708 in the clients 304, 306 (FIG. 7) displays the text and images received from the document storage and retrieval module 408 in the enterprise server 314. As shown in FIG. 112, the client document storage and retrieval module 708 is capable of simultaneously displaying the text of a document in a first window 11202, and the image of a document in a second window 11204.</p>
    <p>The client document storage and retrieval module 708 has features and functions for enabling a user to manipulate and otherwise process the displayed data. For example, the client document storage and retrieval module 708 includes text searching features, powerful text and image navigation features, text processing features, image processing features (as represented by image toolbox 11206 shown in FIG. 112), document organization features, word list features, sophisticated text and image display features, text and image highlighting features, document importation and exportation features, case or group copying features, and print features.</p>
    <p>The document storage and retrieval module 408 in the enterprise server 314 and the client document storage and retrieval module 708 in the clients 304, 306 are collectively further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,679 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,681, incorporated by reference herein, and in pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/341,129, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p>Notes Module</p>
    <p>The notes module 414 manages and interacts with the notes databases 640. The notes module 414 processes enterprise server API commands (described below) to: create new notes, update existing notes, add notes to a document, remove notes from a document, and retrieve all notes associated with a document.</p>
    <p>The client notes module 714 enables a user to view and manipulate notes. FIG. 111 is a screen shot displayed by the client 304, 306 on the client monitor 1122. Text of a patent is displayed in a first window 11104. The client notes module 714 displays upon command the notes that are linked to portions of this patent in a notes window 11108.</p>
    <p>The client notes module 714 receives from the user commands to, for example, edit note contents, create new notes, link new or existing notes to portions of documents, modify notes, and delete notes. The client notes module 714 modifies the display of the notes window 11108 as necessary to reflect these user commands. The client notes module 714 also generates enterprise server API commands corresponding to these user commands, and forwards these enterprise server API commands to the enterprise server 314 for processing by the notes module 414 in the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>Notes may have attributes, such as (but not limited to) the person who created the notes (relevant for security purposes), the date the note was created, the data format(s) of data stored in the note (text, image, graphics, video, audio, spreadsheet, database, etc.), the note title, the note subject, whether the note contains information that would be considered to be Attorney/Client privileged or confidential, and the date the note was last modified.</p>
    <p>According to an embodiment of the invention, notes are hierarchically organized. That is, a given note may be a child note of any number of parent notes, and may have any number of child notes. This, of course, is in addition to the linkage of notes to portions of documents. This hierarchical organization may be implemented by having in the note databases 640 a note<sub>--</sub> note<sub>--</sub> xref table, that would be similar to the group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229. The note<sub>--</sub> note<sub>--</sub> xref table would have a parent note attribute storing the note ID of the parent note, and a child note attribute storing the note ID of the child note. There would be a record in the note<sub>--</sub> note<sub>--</sub> xref table for each parent note/child note relationship in the note hierarchies. It is noted that this note hierarchy provides a structure, organization, and hierarchy to the documents linked to the notes.</p>
    <p>The notes module 414 in the enterprise server 314 and the client notes module 714 in the client 304, 306 are collectively further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,679 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,681, incorporated by reference herein, and in pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/590,082, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <p>Searching Module</p>
    <p>The searching module 410 in the enterprise server 314 interacts with a search engine 424 to conduct searches through the data in the databases 316 pursuant to search requests from the clients 304, 306. The search engine 424 is any commercial and well known search engine. Preferably, the search engine 424 is implemented as the Fulcrum search engine available from Fulcrum Technologies, Inc., Ottawa, Canada. Other commercial search engines could also be used, including (but not limited to) those from Verity Incorporated, Sunnyvale, Calif., Open Text of Canada, and others.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the data in the databases 316 is indexed to facilitate and enhance searching by the search engine 424. For example, each field in each table of the patent bibliographic databases 604 is preferably indexed and searchable. Also, the documents (including the text files and possibly the image files) in the document databases 612 are preferably indexed and searchable. Any well known indexing procedure can be used to index the data in the databases 604. According to an embodiment of the invention, indexing and searching are performed as described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/422,528, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Searching for documents is performed by searching through these indexes. The index tables are preferably stored in the searching module 410, in the searching engine 424, and/or in the databases 316.</p>
    <p>An embodiment of the invention permits operator-defined indexing of data. In this embodiment, an operator can define what data in the databases 316 is to be indexed. For example, an operator can specify that only patents having as assignee "IBM" should be indexed. Or, the operator can specify that only the documents in a given group should be indexed. Such operator-defined indexing enhances searching performance, because the index that is searched is smaller and more targeted.</p>
    <p>The searching module 410 receives enterprise server API commands from the clients 304, 306. The searching module 410 processes these enterprise server API commands and, as a result, causes the search engine 424 to perform at least the following functions: conduct a search to identify documents that satisfy a client-supplied search parameter (for example, to identify documents that contain instances of key words), retrieve and return the search results of a previously executed search, and retrieve and return search hit information for a particular document so that search term highlighting can be performed on the document.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, the documents identified by a search can be easily added to a new group or an existing group by invoking appropriate enterprise server commands, such as the ReqAddDocListToGroup command or the ReqAddPatents command. In the user interface at the client 304, 306, the operator implements this function using drag-and-drop techniques.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the invention creates a new, temporary group to hold the results of a search. A subsequent search could then be scoped or restricted to the documents in this temporary group. Accordingly, the invention supports iterative searching using groups.</p>
    <p>The invention supports many search strategies, including but not limited to keyword, keyword phrase, keyword phrases with boolean, thesaurus, concept searching, object searching, and graphical searching based on likeness of words/images.</p>
    <p>The client searching module 710 in the clients 304, 306 receives search commands from the user. The client search module 710 converts these search commands to corresponding enterprise server API commands, if necessary, and transfers these enterprise server API commands to the enterprise server 314. The client searching module 710 receives from the enterprise server 314 search results. The client searching module 710 displays these search results and enables the user to manipulate and process the search results (such as by enabling the user to add the documents identified by a search to a new or existing group--note that this functionality may also involve the client grouping module 712).</p>
    <p>The invention also supports restricting or defining a search according to aspects of the system, such as historical information. Such historical information can include, for example, the results of a prior search. Thus, the scope of a new search can be restricted to the results of a prior search, or the search criteria in a new search can be added to the search criteria in a prior search. Preferably, the system maintains a search log so that the operator can view and select prior search results and prior search criterions.</p>
    <p>In some embodiments, a user's characteristics (i.e., security level) define the groups that the user can search in. In other words, searches are restricted to groups for which the user has access rights.</p>
    <p>The operation of the client searching module 710 in a client 304, 306 and the searching module 410 in the enterprise server 314 shall now be described in greater detail with reference to FIG. 9. The client searching module 710 supports a number of user interfaces for enabling the user to enter a search command. One user interface is a field driven graphical user interface (GUI) 902. Examples of field driven GUIs 902 are shown in FIGS. 53 and 57.</p>
    <p>Considering first FIG. 53, the client searching module 710 displays the searching window 5302 on the client display monitor 1122. The searching window 5302 includes a Scope of Search field 5304 through which the user can select a scope of search. The user presses a down-arrow button 5306 to obtain a list of possible search scopes. This list may include, for example, all U.S. patents, all foreign patents, both U.S. and foreign patents, all patents in one or more selected groups, the patents in the customer's repository, etc. Searches can also be restricted to portions of documents, such as the claim section in patents. In the example of FIG. 53, the user has defined the search scope as being all U.S. patents.</p>
    <p>The fields in the searching window 5302 allow the user to specify a search of patent bibliographic information, and/or a search of the text of patents. The user can search through patent bibliographic information by entering key terms in the patent number field 5306, the title field 5308, the inventor field 5310, the assignee field 5312, the class field 5314, and/or the date of issue field 5315. The date of issue field 5315 allows the user to specify patents that issued before or after a given date (by filling in fields 5316 and 5318), or that issued between two dates (by filling in fields 5320, 5322, and 5324). It is noted that only some of the attributes of the patent bibliographic databases 604 are shown as being searchable in FIG. 53. In some embodiments, other field driven GUIs (not shown) supported by the invention have search fields corresponding to other attributes of the patent bibliographic databases 604. In these other embodiments, it is possible for the user to search through any of the attributes of the patent bibliographic databases 604.</p>
    <p>The user can search through the text of patents by entering search parameters in an abstract field 5326 and/or the full patent text field 5328.</p>
    <p>It is noted that not all users may have access to all of the search options described above. For example, some users may be only able to search through the patent bibliographic information. Other users may be only able to search through certain attributes of the patent bibliographic information. Other users may be only able to search through the text of patents. The server configuration module 404, described below, controls the search options and capabilities of each user.</p>
    <p>The user can specify the fields to include in the list of search results by appropriately selecting fields 5330. The user can specify a sorting order to display the search results via field 5332. Sorting options include: descending patent numbers, ascending patent numbers, issue date, filing date, serial number, score (the number of search hits), etc.</p>
    <p>FIG. 54 illustrates an example screen shot of search results displayed by the client searching module 710 on the client display monitor 1122. By selecting a "get results in a file command" 5406, the user can write the search results to a user-specified file. By selecting a "patents in local repository command" 5408, the user can display a list of the patents from the search results that are stored in the patent database 614 (i.e., whose text and image files are stored in the patent database 614).</p>
    <p>By selecting a "patents not in local repository" command 5410, the user can display a list of the patents from the search results that are not represented in the patent database 614 (i.e., patents for which the user does not own electronic copies of). The report resulting from selecting the patents not in local repository command 5410 can be used by the user to generate a purchase order to obtain electronic copies of the patents of interest from the search results. In some embodiments, electing this option will cause an electronic message to be sent to a third party service provider. The third party service provider would then electronically send electronic copies of the patents to the customer.</p>
    <p>If the user selects (by double clicking or other well known GUI operation such as selecting a patent and pressing a return button) a patent from the list shown in FIG. 54, then the text and/or image of the selected patent is displayed on the client display monitor 1122. FIG. 55 depicts the display of text, and FIG. 56 depicts the display of an image. Alternatively, both the text and image can be simultaneously displayed on at least some clients 304, 306 using a display format such as that shown in FIG. 112.</p>
    <p>The field driven GUI 5702 of FIG. 57 is similar to that of FIG. 53. Note that the GUI 5702 of FIG. 57 includes a keywords field 5716, which allows the user to search through user-definable fields in the patent bibliographic databases 604. The field driven GUI 5702 of FIG. 57 also allows the user to define the scope of the search via fields 5728. In the example of FIG. 57, the scope of the search can be the full text index (i.e., a search of the patent bibliographic information), only the patents stored in the patent database 614 (i.e., only the patents in the customer's patent repository), only the patents in the current group, or only the current patent. Other embodiments may restrict searching to specific types of documents or specific predefined groups, such as all European patents, all PCT applications, all non-patent documents, documents in BOM groups, etc.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 9, the client searching module 710 generates a query request 908A based on the search criteria that the user entered into the field driven GUI 902. Preferably, this query request 908A is in the native query language of the enterprise server 314. In other words, the query request 908A conforms to the enterprise server API.</p>
    <p>The enterprise server API commands related to querying include the ReqSearch command. As described further below, this command takes searchParameters as a passed parameter. This passed parameter stores the search parameters for the search. A preferred syntax of the search parameters according to the enterprise server API is described below in Tables 2 and 3.</p>

    <p>Each of the Operators in Table 2 (including any spaces to its immediate left or right) is considered to be a search syntax delimiter. Each sequence of characters before, after, or between one of these delimiters will be called a search string "element". Each search string element will be enclosed between a pair of apostrophes to translate it for transmission to Fulcrum. The meaning of and translations for the specific characters that can appear in an element are listed below in Table 3.</p>

    <p>The searching module 410 in the enterprise server 314 receives the query request 908A. A query language syntax analyzer 914 in the searching module 410 checks the query request 908A for any format or syntax errors, such as unbalanced parentheses. The searching module 410 then translates the query request 908A to a new query request in the language of the search engine 424. The new query request is then transferred to the search engine 424 for processing.</p>
    <p>The present invention also supports a native language command line GUI 904 for enabling a user to enter a search request. The command line GUI 904 is typically only used by users who are familiar with the enterprise server API. When using the command line GUI 904, the user enters at the command line a query request 908B. This query request 908B must conform to the enterprise server API. This query request 908B is then transferred to the searching module 410 in the enterprise server 314 where it is processed in the manner described above.</p>
    <p>The present invention further supports any number of foreign language command line GUIs 906 for enabling the user to enter query requests. The invention provides foreign language command line GUIs 906 to support those users who are familiar with database query languages other than the enterprise server API. Such database query languages are herein called foreign query languages for reference purposes. There are many well known foreign query languages, such as the patent specific query language used by the U.S. Patent Office Web Site which is located at http://patents.cnidr.org/access/access.html. The client searching module 710 has a foreign language command line GUI 906 for each foreign query language of interest.</p>
    <p>When using a foreign language command line GUI 906, the user enters at the command line a query request 910. The query request 910 is in the foreign query language associated with the foreign language command line GUI 906. The query request 910 is translated to a query request 908C in the enterprise server API by a translator 912 (there is a translator for each foreign query language supported by the invention). This query request 908C is then transferred to the searching module 410 in the enterprise server 314 where it is processed in the manner described above.</p>
    <p>The present invention also supports searching of other data objects, such as groups (in the group databases 621) and notes (in the notes databases 640). In fact, the present invention supports searching of all the tables in the databases 316. Preferably, all fields in all tables of the databases 316 are indexed and searchable. In some embodiments, only some of the tables are indexed and searchable, such as the group databases 621 and the notes 640. GUIs, such as those discussed above, are used to enable operators to define searches of any attributes of these tables.</p>
    <p>The present invention also supports context and linguistic type searching, and also supports image and object searching. The invention can be used, for example, with data blade search tools, such as those available from Informix.</p>
    <p>Automatic Searches Related to Groups</p>
    <p>The present invention also supports an automated search function related to groups. According to this aspect of the invention, a search is performed of all or part of the document databases 612 and/or the document bibliographic databases 602 to identify documents that satisfy a specified search criteria. The documents identified via this search are added to a specified group.</p>
    <p>For example, suppose that the customer has a group called XYZ group. This group contains the patents that name XYZ corporation as assignee. Periodically, the invention automatically searches the patent bibliographic databases 604 for any patents that name the XYZ corporation as assignee. Any patents found from this search are automatically added to the XYZ group.</p>
    <p>The invention supports performing such automatic searches at user defined intervals (such as every month), or at the occurrence of user-specified events, such as whenever the patent bibliographic databases 604 are updated.</p>
    <p>The invention allows the customer to define such automatic searches. In defining an automatic search, the customer specifies the target databases (what databases to search), the target groups (which groups receive the identified documents), the search criteria, and the frequency or circumstances that the automatic searches take place.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the searching module 410 performs the automatic searches.</p>
    <p>Searching Algorithm</p>
    <p>The searching module 410 processes a search string according to a preferred searching algorithm that is designed to take advantage of the searching and data accessing capabilities of the objects that directly interact with the databases 316. Such objects are herein called database accessing objects because they directly access and interact with the databases 316, and include the search engine(s) 424, the SQL server 426, and other database servers 428.</p>
    <p>A flowchart 13902 shown in FIG. 139 represents a searching algorithm performed by the searching module 410 according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The searching module 410 performs the steps of flowchart 13902 with respect to a search string that it has received from a requester, such as a client 304, 306, or any other entity that wishes to conduct a search of the databases 316.</p>
    <p>The search string includes one or more search string components, also called search string elements, which are preferably in the format shown in Table 3. The search string components/elements are separated by search syntax delimiters (Table 2).</p>
    <p>In step 13906, the searching module 410 identifies the search string components in the search string. The searching module 410 preferably performs step 13906 by parsing through the search string. In the course of such parsing, the searching module 410 identifies search string components based on the location of search string delimiters (that is, search string components represent groups of characters that are separated by search string delimiters). For example, consider the following example search string:</p>
    <p>(Phrase1 AND Phrase2) OR (Phrase6 AND (Phrase3 OR (Phrase4 AND Phrase5))).</p>
    <p>In step 13906, the searching module 410 identifies the following as search string components (parsing the example search string from left to right):</p>
    <p>Phrase1, Phrase2, Phrase6, Phrase3, Phrase4, and Phrase5.</p>
    <p>In step 13908, the searching module 410 analyzes each search string component (identified in step 13906) and assigns each search string component to a database accessing object. The searching module 410 in step 13908 assigns a search string component to a database accessing object based on the characteristics of the search string component and the capabilities of the database accessing object. Specifically, the searching module 410 analyzes and identifies the characteristics of the search string component. The searching module 410 then assigns the search string component to a data accessing object whose capabilities are matched to these characteristics (that is, whose capabilities are well suited for processing search string components having those characteristics).</p>
    <p>For example, suppose that the search string component being considered represents a text search in a collection of documents. This type of search is best suited to be performed by a search engine, such as search engine 424. Search engine 424 is well suited for performing text searches because the text in the databases 316 is indexed.</p>
    <p>As another example, suppose that the search string component represents a search for all patents that are referenced by U.S. Pat. No. 1,234,567. This search string component is best represented as a relational database query. Accordingly, it would be best processed by a relational database engine, such as the SQL server 426 or other relational database servers 428.</p>
    <p>After the search string components have been assigned to data accessing objects, the data accessing objects in step 13908 process their assigned search string components. Such processing preferably occurs in parallel. By processing the search string components in parallel, the length of time that it takes to conduct the search is reduced.</p>
    <p>In step 13910, the data accessing objects transfer their respective result sets or search results to the searching module 410. These search results represent multiple data streams. The searching module 410 in step 13910 combines these data streams according to the logical linking operations represented by the search syntax delimiters in the original search string.</p>
    <p>For example, FIG. 138 illustrates the manner in which the searching module 410 combines the search results resulting from the example search string presented above. R1 represents the search results generated by processing Phrase1. Similarly, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 represent the search results generated by processing Phrase2, Phrase3, Phrase4, Phrase5, and Phrase6.</p>
    <p>The searching module 410 combines R4 and R5 by logically AND'ing R4 and R5. That result is OR'd with R3. The result of that OR operation is AND'd with R6. The result of that AND operation is OR'd with the result of the logical AND'ing operation of R1 and R2. The result of this OR operation represents the final result of processing the original search string.</p>
    <p>Preferably, for efficiency purposes, the result sets received from the database accessing objects are ordered according to a common criteria. Preferably, the result sets are ordered according to patent number.</p>
    <p>The searching module 410 in step 13910 then returns this final result to the requester. Operation of flowchart 13902 is then complete, as indicated by step 13912.</p>
    <p>In the present invention, it is not necessary to store the intermediate search results. For example, it is not necessary to store R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6. Instead, the searching module 410 processes the intermediate search results as they are received. Referring to FIG. 138, the searching module 410 processes R4 and R5 (as they are received) by AND'ing them together. The result of that AND operation is immediately processed with R3 (as it is received) by OR'ing them together. The other search results are processed as they are received in a similar manner. As a result, the searching module 410 does not need to store the intermediate search results R1-R6 for any length of time.</p>
    <p>The searching algorithm of the present invention shall now be further described with reference to the processing of the "patents in local repository" command 5408 and the "patents not in local repository" command 5410 (FIG. 54). These commands were discussed above.</p>
    <p>The searching module 410 executes the "patents in local repository" command 5408 by first processing a search string in the manner shown in the flowchart 13902 (FIG. 139). The results of processing this search string are then logically AND'ed with a listing of the patents in the patent repository (that is, in the patent database 614). This logical AND operation yields a list of patents which satisfied the search string, and which are also in the patent database 614.</p>
    <p>The searching module 410 performs the "patents not in local repository" command 5410 by first processing a search string in a manner discussed above with reference to flowchart 13902 in FIG. 139. The results of processing the search string are then logically NAND'ed with the list of patents in the patent database 614. This NAND operation yields a list of patents which satisfy the search string, but which are not in the patent database 614.</p>
    <p>Grouping Module</p>
    <p>The grouping module 412 in the enterprise server 314 manages and interacts with the group databases 621. The grouping module 412 receives and processes enterprise server API commands (sent from clients 304, 306) to perform at least the following functions: obtain information on the hierarchy of the groups stored in the group databases 621, make an existing group a child of another group, unlink a child group from one of its parent groups, update group properties, create a new group as a child of an existing group, obtain a list of documents in a group, add documents to a group, and remove documents from a group.</p>
    <p>The grouping module 412 also supports group import and export functions. Some of these group import functions relating to BOM groups, corporate entity groups, and inventorship groups are described below. The grouping module 412 also supports a user-defined group (or generic) group import function. When performing this function, the grouping module 412 receives a properly structured file comprising a plurality of records (or lines of information), where each record specifies a name of a group and a physical level of the group in the group hierarchy. From this file, the grouping module 412 creates a user-defined group hierarchy in the user-defined group databases 624.</p>
    <p>An example file for group importation is shown below (other file structures could alternatively be used):</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular">______________________________________    1   A    2   B    3   C    2   D    3   E    4   F    3   G______________________________________</pre>
    
    <p>The first column corresponds to the physical level in the group hierarchy, and the second column corresponds to the group name. The information contained in this example file corresponds to a group hierarchy shown in FIG. 115.</p>
    <p>The grouping module 412, upon receipt of this file, creates a record in the group<sub>--</sub> table 1227 for each of the groups represented in the file (i.e., for groups A, B, C, D, E, F, and G). The physical level information from the file is stored in the group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229. For example, the group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229 would have a record that indicates that Group A is the parent of Group B. The group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229 would also have a record that would indicate that Group G is a child of Group D. (It is noted that similar physical level information is also preferably in the customer BOM data 4704 (FIG. 47) with respect to load of the BOM databases 626.)</p>
    <p>The client grouping module 712 displays the group hierarchy and the documents in a group, and enables a user to manipulate and process groups. FIG. 58 depicts an example screen shot displayed by the client grouping module 712 on the client monitor 1122. In a first window 5804, the client grouping module 712 displays a graphical representation of the hierarchy of groups stored in the group databases 621. Suppose that the user has selected an ALU group 5808 in this first window 5804. Selection of a group in the first window 5804 causes a list of the documents in the selected group to be displayed in a second window 5806. Accordingly, the client grouping module 712 displays the following list of documents: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,333,AAA; 4,788,BBB; 5,278,CCC; 4,760,478 (as should be apparent from this example, many of the patents referred to herein for illustrative purposes are fictional). These documents are in the selected ALU group. Note that the second window 5806 also displays bibliographic information on the listed documents. Preferably, the information listed in the second window 5806 is in a spread sheet format. However, other formats could alternatively be used.</p>
    <p>Selecting (by double clicking) a document from the list in the second window 5806 causes the selected document to be displayed. For example, suppose that the user selected U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,478 from the list displayed in the second window. This would cause the client 304, 306 to obtain the text and image of this patent from the databases 316 via the enterprise server 314. The client document storage retrieval module 708 would then display the retrieved text and image of the '478 patent at the client monitor 1122 using the format shown in FIG. 112, where the text is displayed in a text window 11202, and the image is displayed in an image window 11204.</p>
    <p>The client grouping module 712 receives from the user commands to navigate through the group hierarchy, to edit the group hierarchy, to edit groups, to add documents to groups, to delete documents from groups, to delete groups, etc. The client grouping module 712 modifies the display of the window 5802 as necessary to reflect these user commands. The client grouping module 712 also generates enterprise server API commands corresponding to these user commands, and forwards these enterprise server API commands to the enterprise server 314 for processing by the grouping module 412 in the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>Analysis Modules</p>
    <p>The analysis modules 416 are shown in FIG. 10. These analysis modules 416, which are also called methodology modules 416, automatically interact and process data contained in the databases 316 pursuant to user commands. The analysis modules 416 are patent-centric (or document-centric) and group-oriented. The analysis modules 416 are patent-centric because they all involve the processing (including reporting, analysis, and planning) of patent data either with or without consideration of other data, such as production data, HR data, financial data, etc. The analysis modules 416 are group-oriented because they have the capability of processing the patents (or other documents) in one or more groups, and potentially the children of these groups.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the invention is adapted and intended to include a wide and varied range of analysis modules 416. The analysis modules 416 shown in FIG. 10 represent only a sampling of the analysis modules 416 that the invention is adapted and intended to support. The invention can support many other analysis modules 416 because the databases 316 are so rich. The analysis modules 416 can include any other module that performs useful processing (from the point of view of the customer) of the data in the databases 316. Accordingly, the particular collection of analysis modules 416 shown in FIG. 10 are described herein for the purpose of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>For illustrative purposes, the analysis modules 416 are sometimes described herein as working with particular types of groups, such as BOM groups. However, it should be understood that the analysis modules 416 can work with any types of groups.</p>
    <p>The analysis modules 416 are described in detail in sections below.</p>
    <p>Security Module</p>
    <p>The security module 402 in the enterprise server 314 manages and interacts with the security databases 636, which stores information required to implement the security features of the invention. The security module 402 utilizes the information in the security databases 636 to implement a multilevel security methodology. The security databases 636 and the multilevel security methodology implemented by the security module 402 are described in detail in sections below.</p>
    <p>The client security module 702 in the clients 304, 306 enable a user to access and modify the security information in the security databases 636. Typically, access to the client security module 702 and the security databases 636 is limited to users with high security clearances, such as system administrators.</p>
    <p>Server Administration Module</p>
    <p>The server administration module 418 performs functions related to the enterprise server 314's resources, such as the databases 316 and the indexes to the databases 316. Some of the server administration module 418 functions include performing reindexing operations of the databases 316, when necessary, importing and exporting large portions of the databases 316, upon request, managing directories, etc. The server administration module 418 is also responsible for establishing user sessions with the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>The client server administration module 718 at the client 304, 306 and/or the server administration module 418 in the enterprise server 314 preferably maintains one or more server configuration files. Information in the server configuration files identifies, for example, the physical location of the databases, the number of possible concurrent users, memory size allocations, etc. The server configuration files can also include log files. The server configuration files would indicate what events are to be logged to the log files, such as whether to track all user actions, track error conditions, etc.</p>
    <p>Server Configuration Module</p>
    <p>Not all users have access to all of the enterprise server functions. A normal user, for example, may be only able to search documents and document bibliographical information, view documents, and print documents. Accordingly, a normal user would be able to access only the document storage and retrieval module 408 and the searching module 410 of the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>Also, different users may have different search capabilities. Some users may be able to search only document bibliographic information, while other users may be able to search both document bibliographic information and the text of documents.</p>
    <p>A power user may be allowed access to all enterprise server functions. The power user could search documents and document bibliographical information, view documents, print documents, work with groups, work with notes, and invoke analysis functions. Accordingly, the power user would be able to access the document storage and retrieval module 408, the searching module 410, the grouping module 412, the notes module 414, and the analysis modules 416 of the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>A system administrator may be able to set user security levels and perform enterprise server administration functions. Accordingly, a system administrator would have access to at least the security module 402 and the server administration module 418.</p>
    <p>The modules loaded on a user's computer preferably depend on the user's security level, and correspond to the modules in the enterprise server 314 to which the user has access. Referring to FIG. 7, only the client document storage and retrieval module 708 and the client searching module 710 are preferably loaded on the computers (i.e., clients 304, 306) of normal users. The client document storage and retrieval module 708, the client searching module 710, the client grouping module 712, the client notes module 714, and the client analysis module 716 are loaded on the computers of power users. The client security module 702 and the client server administration module 718 are preferably loaded on the computers of system administrators.</p>
    <p>The system configuration module 404 in the enterprise server 314 keeps track of the functions and modules that each user is permitted to access. Preferably, the server configuration module 404 maintains a database (not shown) having access privilege information for each user (note that this is different than security access information). As shown in FIG. 101, when the enterprise server 314 receives a command from a user, the server configuration module 404 in step 10108 ensures that the user has access to the target module (i.e., the module in the enterprise server 314 that would have responsibility for processing the command) before allowing the command dispatch module 406 to forward the command to the target module for processing. FIG. 101 is further described below.</p>
    <p>The functions and enterprise server modules that a user is allowed to access is dependent on a number of factors, such as the user's level of need, the user's level of expertise, and/or whether or not the user has purchased the modules and/or databases (in some embodiments, it may be necessary for the user to pay a fee to access and obtain the benefits of an enterprise server module, such as the notes module 414, the grouping module 412, and/or the analysis modules 416).</p>
    <p>The user's computer platform is also a consideration. In some embodiments, software for some client modules (such as the client grouping module 712, the client notes module 714, and/or the client analysis module 716) may not exist for the user's particular computer platform. This is especially true for the computer platforms used to implement the web clients 304. In these cases, the user will not be able to access any of the enterprise server modules for which the user's platform does not have a corresponding client module. In other embodiments, however, software for all of the client modules are available for all platforms. Accordingly, the user's computer platform is not a consideration with respect to the issue of which enterprise server modules the user is capable of accessing. In these embodiments, the client modules may be implemented using multi-platform enabled software, such as Java or other such software.</p>
    <p>In some embodiments, the modules are not loaded on the user's computer. Instead, they are run from a server connected to the user's computer. However, a particular user may not have access to all of the modules on the server, for the reasons discussed above.</p>
    <p>Command Dispatch Module</p>
    <p>The command dispatch module 406 routes enterprise server API commands received from clients 304, 306 to the enterprise server modules that are responsible for processing the commands. This functionality is represented in step 10110 of FIG. 101, described below. The enterprise server API commands are described below. Also described below is the mapping of enterprise server API commands to enterprise server modules (i.e., which enterprise server modules process which enterprise server API commands).</p>
    <p>Clients</p>
    <p>As noted above, the system 302 preferably includes two types of clients, network clients 306 and web clients 304. The network clients 306 and the web clients 304 are discussed in greater detail below.</p>
    <p>It is noted that the functional capabilities of network clients 306 and web clients 304 may differ in some embodiments, and may be the same in other embodiments (this is described below). However, for simplicity purposes, the present invention is sometimes described as interacting with "clients 304, 306," which may represent one or more network clients 306, one or more web clients 304, or any combination of network clients 306 and web clients 304.</p>
    <p>Network Clients</p>
    <p>The network clients 306 preferably communicate with the enterprise server 314 using the enterprise server 314's natural language, which is called the enterprise server API (application program interface). The network clients 306 can be considered to represent web browsers that are specific to the language and the functions supported by the enterprise server 314. The enterprise server API is described below.</p>
    <p>The network clients 306 preferably communicate directly with the enterprise server 314 via a communication network 312, which is preferably a network that supports the well known HTTP (hypertext transport) protocol.</p>
    <p>Each network client 306 is preferably implemented using a computer, such as the computer 1102 shown in FIG. 11. Preferably, the computers used to implement the network clients 306 are personal computers with at least 16 MBytes of main memory 1108, running the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or the Microsoft Windows NT operating system. The software executing in the network clients 306 is preferably written in the C++ computer programming language.</p>
    <p>In fact, preferably all software of the invention is written using the C++ computer programming language. Database manipulation code is written in a combination of SQL and C++. Other computer programming languages could alternatively be used, such as SmallTalk, Java, C, Pascal, ADA, etc.</p>
    <p>Web Clients</p>
    <p>The web clients 304 are each preferably implemented using a computer such as that shown in FIG. 11. Commercial web browser software preferably executes in the web clients 304. Any commercial and well known web browser software can be used, such as web browser software from Netscape, Microsoft, Sun, etc.</p>
    <p>Unlike the network clients 306, the web clients 304 do not typically utilize the enterprise server API. Accordingly, the web clients 304 communicate indirectly with the enterprise server 314 via the web server 310.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 is a block diagram of the web server 310. This block diagram also illustrates the data flow between the web client 304 and the enterprise server 314 via the web server 310. The web server 310 includes a translator 804 that translates between the respective languages of the web clients 304 (preferably HTML, or hypertext markup language) and the language of the enterprise server 314 (i.e., the enterprise server API).</p>
    <p>Specifically, the enterprise server 314 sends raw data 802 to the web server 310 over the network 312. The translator 804 in the web server 310 translates the raw data 802 to data in the well known HTML data format. This HTML data 806 is sent to the web client 304 over network 308. A browser 808 in the web client 304 renders the HTML data 806. The translator 804 translates data going from the web client 304 to the enterprise server 314 in a similar manner. It is noted that data formats other than HTML could alternatively be used. In particular, any data format used by the browser 808 could alternatively be used in the invention.</p>
    <p>Since the web server 310 communicates with the enterprise server over the network 312 using the enterprise server API, the web server 310 appears to be a network client 306 from the perspective of the enterprise server 314. The interaction between the web clients 304 and the enterprise server 314, and the network clients 306 and the enterprise server 314, is further described below.</p>
    <p>The use of commercial web browser software in the web clients 304 is advantageous because such software executes on different computer platforms (that is, there are versions of the browser software that executes on different computer platforms), such as computer platforms produced by IBM, Apple, Sun, SGI, HP, companies producing computers that are compatible with those produced by these companies, etc. Thus, the present invention via the web clients 304 enables users working on any type of computer platform for which a commercial web browser is available to access the enterprise server 314 and the databases 316. This feature of the invention is particularly important in the data processing world of today, where any given corporate entity may have users on many different computer platforms. The present invention allows all of these users (using commercial web browser software, which the corporation may already own) to access and work with the enterprise server 314 and the databases 316, irrespective of the type of computer that they are using.</p>
    <p>Enterprise Server API (Application Programming Interface)</p>
    <p>The enterprise server API includes commands for accessing functions and capabilities supported by the enterprise server modules (shown in FIG. 4). Many of the enterprise server commands have an implicit parameter which is the sessionID (identifier) of the current server session. A sessionID is obtained by calling the ReqLogin command. All commands issue an exception on failure.</p>
    <p>Interaction between the clients 304, 306 and the enterprise server 314 is conducted via direct or indirect use of the enterprise server API, whether or not stated explicitly herein.</p>
    <p>Other applications (not discussed herein) may interact with the enterprise server 314 as long as such applications conform to the enterprise server API.</p>
    <p>An embodiment of the invention includes timed, automatic executing commands (such as the automatic searches described above). These commands execute upon the occurrence of an event (the event can be defined in the passed parameters of the commands). Such events include time (for example, execute every 30 days), system update (for example, run this search every time new patents are loaded into the enterprise server), data change (for example, automatically regroup these patents every time a corporate entity changes), etc. These timed automatic executing commands are essentially those listed and described below, with additional logic for detecting the occurrence of the defined condition(s)/event(s), and for automatic execution upon such detection.</p>
    <p>The commands that make up the enterprise server API according to an embodiment of the invention are described below. It should be understood that the enterprise server API is extendable to support other enterprise server modules, or to support additional or modified functions in existing enterprise server modules, or to support other functions described herein. Embodiments of the enterprise server API may include only a subset of the following commands. Also, modules other than the ones identified could process the following commands. For example, the Server Administration Module 418 could process the Security Module 402's commands.</p>

    <p>Client/Server Interaction</p>
    <p>FIG. 101 is a flowchart depicting the generic interaction between the network clients 306 and the web clients 304 with the enterprise server 314. In step 10106, a client 304, 306 (either a network client 306 or a web client 304) sends a command and possibly information to the Enterprise server 314. The command represents a request to a module of the Enterprise server 314 to perform some function (which is called the requested function for reference purposes). In the case of the web client 304, the web server 310 translates the command to a message that conforms with the enterprise server API. In the case of the network client 306, the command already conforms to the enterprise server API.</p>
    <p>In step 10108, the security module 402 and the server configuration module 404 (see FIG. 4) in the Enterprise Server 314 determine whether or not the client 304, 306, or the user who is using the client 304, 306, is authorized to issue the command. More particularly, the security module 402 determines whether or not the client 304, 306 or user has the appropriate security privileges with respect to the target information in the databases 316 (that is, the information in the databases 316 that will be accessed if the requested function is performed by the enterprise server 314). The server configuration module 404 determines whether or not the client 304, 306 or user has access to the requested function (i.e., has the client 304, 306 or user been configured to access the requested function?). If the client 304, 306 or user is authorized to issue the command, then step 10110 is performed. Otherwise, the enterprise server 10110 does not honor (does not perform) the command (an appropriate message or exception may be sent back to the client 304, 306).</p>
    <p>In step 10110, the command dispatch module 406 in the enterprise server 314 routes the command and the information to the appropriate enterprise server module. These enterprise server modules are described above.</p>
    <p>In step 10112, the enterprise server module performs the requested function.</p>
    <p>In step 10114, the Enterprise server 314 sends the results of the command to the client 304, 306. In the case of the web client 304, the web server 310 translates the results received from the enterprise server 314 to the language supported by the web client 304 (preferably HTML), and then forwards these translated results to the web client 304 over the network 308. This network may be a local area network or a wide area network (it can even be a global network).</p>
    <p>In step 10116, modules in the client 304, 306 operate to display the results to the user, and also operate to enable the user to manipulate, process, and otherwise utilize the results.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 illustrates client modules 701 of a web client 304 and a network client 306 according to an embodiment of the invention. The modules in a web client 304 or a network client 306 correspond to modules in the enterprise server 314. A given module in the enterprise server 314 performs specific tasks pursuant to commands received from the clients 304, 306. The performance of these tasks generates results. For example, the document storage and retrieval module 408 in the enterprise server 314 stores and retrieves information from the databases 316.</p>
    <p>The corresponding module in the clients 304, 306 receives these results and presents them to the user, and enables the user to work with and manipulate the results. For example, the client document storage and retrieval module 708 presents to the user the information retrieved by the document storage and retrieval module 408 in the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>The process just described is an iterative one, as represented by control arrow 10118.</p>
    <p>The interaction between the web clients 304 and the enterprise server 314, and the network clients 306 and the enterprise server 314, is further described with reference to FIGS. 81-83. FIG. 81 generically depicts the interaction between the enterprise server 314 and the clients 304, 306. A client 304, 306 (either a web client 304 or a network client 306) sends, for example, a ReqSearch command to the enterprise server 314. The searching module 410 in the enterprise server 314 processes the ReqSearch command, and returns a handle (pointer) to the search results plus a list of documents from startIndex to endIndex. The client 304, 306 then issues a ReqRetrieveSearchResult in order to obtain the search results. The searching module 410 processes the ReqRetrieveSearchResult, and returns a list of documents.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 82 and 83 contrasts, in greater detail, the interaction between the enterprise server 314 and the network clients 306, and the enterprise server 314 and the web clients 304. FIG. 82 represents the interaction between the enterprise server 314 and a network client 306. The network client 306 sends a ReqRawCan command to the enterprise server 314. The document storage and retrieval module 408 processes this command, and returns image data representative of the document. Since the network client 306 supports the enterprise server API, translation of the command or the return result is not necessary.</p>
    <p>FIG. 83 represents the interaction between the enterprise server 314 and a web clients 304. The web client 304 issues a command to retrieve a document image. This command may or may not conform to the enterprise server API. If it does not conform, the web server 310 translates the command to one that conforms to the enterprise server API. The enterprise server 314 returns an image. However, the image is not in a format that the web client 304 supports. Thus, the web server 310 converts the image to a format that the web client 304 supports. In the example of FIG. 83, the web server 310 converts the image to the well known JPEG format, then forwards the converted image to the web client 304. Other image formats could also be used, and depends on the formats used by the commercial web browser software being used in the web clients 304.</p>
    <p>Patent-Centric URL Commands</p>
    <p>The interaction between the enterprise server 314 and the web clients 304 shall now be more particularly described.</p>
    <p>FIG. 151 illustrates the interaction between the Enterprise server 314 and the web client 304. FIG. 151 is similar to FIG. 8. However, FIG. 151 focuses on the commands that are transferred between the web client 304 and the Enterprise server 314, whereas FIG. 8 focuses on the data which is transferred between the web client 304 and the Enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>As discussed above, the web client 304 preferably includes a browser 808, which can be any commercially available browser, such as (but not limited to) those available from Netscape, Microsoft, IBM, SUN, Novell, etc. In an embodiment of the invention, the browser 808 issues URL (Uniform Resource Locator) commands in order to access and retrieve data from the databases 316 via the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>The general format of URL commands is well known, and is presented in FIG. 150 for the convenience of the reader. A URL command 15002 includes a protocol field 15004, a destination field 15006, and a command field 15008.</p>
    <p>The protocol field 15004 specifies the protocol that is to be used in transporting the URL command 15002 from its source to its destination. Example protocols include HTTP and FTP (file transfer protocol).</p>
    <p>The destination field 15006 specifies the destination of the URL command 15002. For example, the destination field 15006 may include information that identifies the server (such as the enterprise server 314) from whom information is being requested from.</p>
    <p>The Command field 15008 stores information representing a command or an action or an identification of requested data. The effect of the URL command 15002 is to request that the entity identified by the destination field 15006 perform the command or action specified in the command field 15008.</p>
    <p>According to the invention, the commands inserted into the command field 15008 are patent-centric or patent-specific. Accordingly, the URL commands generated by the present invention are patent-centric, or patent-specific.</p>
    <p>In practice, HTML data representative of a web page is transferred to the browser 808 in the web client 304 upon connection with the Enterprise server 314. The browser 808 processes this received HTML data and, as a result, displays a web page. HTML processing is well known. Examples of web pages are shown in FIGS. 53 and 140. An operator at the web client 304 enters information into the fields of the web page.</p>
    <p>For example, with reference to FIG. 53, an operator could enter an inventor name into the inventor field 5310 of web page 5302. The information entered by the operator represents a search string. After receiving an appropriate user command (which the user issues by pressing the Search button 5334, for example), the browser 808 in accordance with the software associated with the displayed web page 5302 generates one or more URL commands. These URL commands include the information entered by the operator into the fields of the displayed web page 5302. In other words, these URL commands include the search string entered by the operator. These URL commands are directed to the enterprise server 314, and request the enterprise server 314 to conduct one or more searches of the databases 316 in accordance with the operator-supplied search string.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 151, a translator 804 in the Web server 310 receives the URL commands from the browser 808 in the web client 304. The translator 804 converts the URL commands to Enterprise server API commands. These Enterprise server API commands are received and processed by the Enterprise server 314. The Enterprise server API commands are discussed above.</p>
    <p>According to an embodiment of the present invention, the URL commands sent from the browser 808 in the web client 304 to the translator 804 in the Web server 310 conform to a patent-centric URL command language. Accordingly, the URL commands sent from the browser 808 to the translator 804 represent patent-centric URL commands.</p>
    <p>The patent-centric URL command language of the present invention essentially represents an API (Application Programming Interface) of the Web server 310. The patent-centric URL command language of the present invention includes the following patent-specific commands that are inserted in the command field 15008 of URL commands. It should be understood that the following is a representation of the types of commands that can be placed into the command field 15008 of URL commands according to the invention. The invention can support other patent-centric/specific commands. Thus, the following is provided for purposes of illustration, not limitation.</p>
    <p>Command: Search</p>
    <p>Description: This command is used to instruct the enterprise server 314 to perform a search or to retrieve more results from a previous search.</p>

    <p>Operation</p>
    <p>An operator defines a search using, for example, the patent search screen 14002 of FIG. 140. The web client 304 generates a patent-centric URL command that contains a search command in the command field 15008. The parameters of the search command reflect the search defined by the operator. For example, if the operator defined a search based on patent number and PTO class, then the number and class parameters of the search command would be filled in.</p>
    <p>For a new search, the begin parameter is equal to 0, indicating that the enterprise server 314 should return the search results beginning from record 0 (of the search results). The numberpage parameter indicates to the enterprise server 314 the number of items to return search results on. For example, if the numberpage parameter equals 10, then the enterprise server 314 returns information on 10 search results items, starting with the first item (where begin is equal to 0).</p>
    <p>In a new search, the total parameter is returned by the enterprise server 314, and represents the number of search hits. This value of the total parameter is then returned to the enterprise server 314 in any subsequent, related search commands (to obtain additional search results, for example). The browser 808 receives the search results provided by the enterprise server 314 and displays the search results in a screen such as that shown in FIG. 141. The operator presses the navigation icons 14108 to obtain additional search results. If the operator presses a Next icon 14109, for example, a new URL command with the search command in the command field 15008 is generated to obtain the next page of search results.</p>
    <p>For this and any other subsequent, related search commands, the parameters (such as scope, search key terms, items to display, etc.) that define the search are the same as in the original search command. In this and subsequent related search commands, however, the GUID of the original search results is provided. The enterprise server 314 uses this GUID to access the original search results, if they are still available on the enterprise server 314 (they may have expired). If the original search results are not still available on the enterprise server 314, then the enterprise server 314 reexecutes the search.</p>
    <p>In the case where the operator pressed the Next icon 14109, the rel field is set equal to NEXT. If the operator pressed the Previous icon 14111, the rel field is set equal to PREVIOUS. If the operator presses a Last icon 14119, the rel field is set equal to LAST. If the operator pressed a First icon 14191, the rel field is set equal to FIRST.</p>
    <p>In the case where the operator pressed the Next icon 14109, the begin field is set to 0. The enterprise server 314, upon receipt of this command, identifies the next page of search results to send to the web client 304. The enterprise server 314 does this by adding the value of the numberpage to the value of begin. The result of this addition operation identifies the first record in the search results to send to the web client 304. Starting from this value, the enterprise server 314 sends numberpage items to the web client 304. Thus, where the begin field is equal to 0, and the numberpage is equal to 10, the enterprise server 314 sends records 10-19 of the search results to the web client 304.</p>
    <p>Suppose that the operator again presses the Next icon 14109. In the resulting search command, the begin field is set to 10 (this is done by software associated with the link associated with the Next icon 14109 in the display 14102 in FIG. 141). The enterprise server 314, upon receipt of this command, sends numberpage items to the web client 304 starting from begin plus numberpage. Thus, where the begin field is equal to 10, and the numberpage is equal to 10, the enterprise server 314 sends records 20-29 of the search results to the web client 304.</p>
    <p>If rel is equal to GET<sub>--</sub> RESULTS<sub>--</sub> IN<sub>--</sub> FILE, then the enterprise server 314 returns HTML data to the web client 304. The web client 304 prompts the operator for a file name, and then saves this data in the file identified by the file name.</p>
    <p>If rel is equal to SKIM<sub>--</sub> IMAGES, then the enterprise server 314 returns information that identifies two frames (or windows or panes). The enterprise server 314 supplies, for one of the frames, information that identifies a file in the enterprise server 314. This file stores a list of the search results. The web client 304 issues a URL command to retrieve this file from the enterprise server 314. The web client 304 then displays the list of the search results into this first frame. For the second frame, the enterprise server 314 provides information that identifies the location of the image of the first item in the search results. The web client 304 issues a URL command to retrieve this image (or a portion of the image, like the portion of the image corresponding to the first page of the document) from the enterprise server 314. The web client 304 then displays this image in the second frame. This two frame display is shown, for example, in FIG. 148.</p>
    <p>In the above description, the enterprise server 314 is described as interpreting the URL commands generated by the web client 304. In practice, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the translator 804 in the web server 310 translates the URL commands to commands in the enterprise server API language. The enterprise server 314 then processes these enterprise server API commands as discussed herein. Such translation is described below.</p>
    <p>Command: GetText</p>
    <p>Description: This command instructs the enterprise server 314 to retrieve and return the text of a patent. Preferably, the web server 310 returns the entire text of the patent to the web client 304. However, the following additional parameters are used for text/image synchronization purposes (i.e., when the operator switches between displaying text and displaying images).</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular">______________________________________Parameters:   section   Image files can contain multiple sections.             The first section is the image of a patent.             Subsequent sections contain post-issuance             documents, such as a certificate of             correction. This parameter describes the             specific section desired from the image file             and is used to help synchronize text and             image display. Specifically, suppose that the             operator is viewing an image. Then the             operator elects to view text, such that a             GetText command is generated. In the             section and page parameters of this             GetTest command, the section and page of             the image being viewed (when the GetText             command is generated) is stored. Thus, if             the operator then elects to switch back to             viewing the image, the invention can identify             which image to display by reference to the             values stored in these section and page             parameters.   page      Sections are decomposed into pages.

This parameter             identifies the current display mode, and             is used by the invention to identify icons             that should be active and inactive. For             example, if currentview is equal to             SPLIT<sub>--</sub> SCREEN, then any             split screen icons are greyed out, to             indicate that they are inactive.   number    Identifies the document to retrieve (such as a             patent number)______________________________________</pre>
    
    <p>Command: GetImage</p>
    <p>Description: This command instructs the enterprise server 314 to retrieve and return the image of a patent. Parameters are the same as described for GetText: section, page, and currentview. Section and page identify which image to retrieve.</p>
    <p>Command: GetSplitScreen</p>
    <p>Description: This command returns two views of a patent, one of the text and one of the image. Number identifies the document whose text is retrieved and displayed. Section and page identify the image which is retrieved and displayed. In an embodiment, the enterprise server 314 returns information on two side-by-side frames (or panes or windows). For one of the windows, the enterprise server 314 provides a GetText command (or equivalent enterprise server API command, which is then translated to the GetText command), to return the text corresponding to the document identified by number. In the other window, the enterprise server 314 provides a GetImage command (or equivalent enterprise server API command, which is then translated to the GetImage command), to return the image corresponding to section and page. The web client 304 then executes these GetText and GetImage command to retrieve this information from the enterprise server 314.</p>

    <p>Translation</p>
    <p>As described above, the translator 804 in the web server 310 translates between patent-centric URL commands and enterprise server API commands (see FIG. 151). Such translation according to an embodiment of the invention is shown in the following table. Other translations between patent-centric URL commands and enterprise server API commands are possible.</p>

    <p>Client Architecture</p>
    <p>FIG. 114 illustrates a logical representation of the architecture of the network client 306 according to an embodiment of the invention. This architecture also applies to the web client 304 in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the web client 304 is represented by well known browser software executing in a computer, such as that shown in FIG. 10.</p>
    <p>The User Interface layer 11404 may be based on various well known user interfaces. The user interface layer in the web client 304 preferably processes HTML data. The user interface layer 11404 in the network client 306 preferably uses MFC, or the Microsoft Foundation Class Library. In some embodiments, the user interface layer 11404 is built using multi-platform enabled languages, such as Java.</p>
    <p>The client modules 701 are shown in FIG. 7, and are described elsewhere herein.</p>
    <p>The transaction management layer 11406 implements the specific business-related operations of the invention. These operations include creating a group or changing the security permissions of the group (this could alternatively be done by the domain layer 11408). The transaction management layer 11406 interacts with the client modules 701 to perform these functions.</p>
    <p>The domain layer 11408 includes all of the objects that are required to properly implement a patent-centric decision support system. These objects in the domain layer 11408 represent the business and other high level intelligence of the client 304, 306, and enables the client 304, 306 to work with business rules, notes, analysis modules, etc.</p>
    <p>Supporting the domain layer 11408 is a broker layer 11410 that provides for sophisticated brokering and caching of objects in the client 304, 306. The broker layer 11410 is responsible for managing the communication between the domain layer 11408 and the server layer 11416. This decouples the domain layer 11408 from the enterprise server 314 and provides for maximum flexibility in the implementation of different enterprise servers 314.</p>
    <p>The caching subsystem 11412 of the broker layer 11410 provides a means for objects to be cached on the client 304, 306 after they have been retrieved from the enterprise server 314. The caching subsystem 11412 enables the client 304, 306 to manage an infinite number of objects obtained from the enterprise server 314 by only storing those objects that have been most recently used. In an embodiment of the invention, the client 304, 306 utilizes a demand paging algorithm. In an embodiment of the invention, caching only takes place on the network client 306.</p>
    <p>A demand paging algorithm according to an embodiment of the invention is represented by a flowchart 14902 shown in FIG. 149. Preferably, the present invention utilizes a two-level demand paging methodology. The first level of the demand paging methodology is performed by the Caching subsystem 11412 in the client 306, 304, and is represented by steps 14950 in flowchart 14902. The second level of the demand paging methodology is performed by the Enterprise server 314, and is represented by steps 14952 in the flowchart 14902.</p>
    <p>In step 14906, the Cache subsystem 11412 receives a request for data from a requester (the requester is typically an upper layer in the architecture). This data request is described herein as being a request for patent data. However, the discussion described herein applies to both patent and non-patent data.</p>
    <p>At this point, it would be useful to describe an example of how a data request is generated. Consider an example console user interface 11802 shown in FIG. 118 (FIG. 118 is further described below). A group hierarchy 11712 is shown in a first pane 11704 of the console user interface 11802. Patents contained within a selected group of the group hierarchy 11712 are listed (with their bibliographical information) in a second pane 11706. In the example shown in FIG. 118, a repository group 11710 is selected. Accordingly, the patents in the repository group 11710 are listed (along with their bibliographical information) in the second pane 11706 of the console user interface 11802.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at any given time, all of the information pertaining to the patents in the repository 11710 is not stored in the client 304, 306. Instead, only a portion of the information pertaining to the patents in the repository 11710 are stored in the client 304,306. Preferably, the client 304, 306 retrieves data from the databases 316 as it needs it.</p>
    <p>For example, 13 patents are currently listed in the second pane 11706. The client 304, 306 need only store information on these 13 listed patents. In practice, however, at any given time the client 304, 306 may store information on more than the patents being displayed in the second pane 11706. More generally, at any given time, the client 304, 306 may store information on more than the patents being processed, analyzed, displayed, etc., at the client 304, 306. However, the client 304, 306 does not store all of the data from the repository 11710 (unless, for some reason, the client 304, 306 is processing all of that data). Also, during a session with the enterprise server 314, the client 304, 306 does not discard information that it has received from the enterprise server 314, even when the information is no longer being used at the client 304, 306. In other embodiments, the client 304, 306 discards unused data received from the enterprise server 314 in order to make room for additional data.</p>
    <p>The client 304,306 retrieves information from the enterprise server 314 by sending a data retrieval request to the Caching subsystem 11412. The Caching subsystem 11412 receives this request in step 14906.</p>
    <p>Further in step 14906, the Caching subsystem 11412 identifies from the data retrieval request the patent and the portions of the patent that are being requested. Preferably, in the present invention, a patent has multiple parts or portions. These parts include the patent bibliographic information, the patent (equivalent) text file, and the patent image file. A given data retrieval request may be requesting any or all of these portions of the patent. In step 14906, the Caching subsystem 11412 identifies from the data request which patent is being requested, and also which portions of the patent are being requested. For reference purposes, the patent that is being requested is called the identified patent, and the portions of the identified patent that are being requested are called the identified portions.</p>
    <p>In step 14910, the Caching subsystem 11412 determines whether the identified portions of the identified patent are already stored in the local cache. For purposes of the present invention, the local cache is represented by the main memory 1108 in the client 304, 306. In alternate embodiments of the invention, the local cache is represented by cache memory in the client 304,306.</p>
    <p>If the identified portions of the identified patent are currently in the local cache, then in step 14912 the Caching subsystem 11412 retrieves those identified portions of the identified patent from the local cache and returns them to the requester. Operation of flowchart 14902 is then complete, as indicated by step 14922.</p>
    <p>If, in step 14910, the Caching subsystem 11412 determines that the identified portions of the identified patent are not in the local cache, then step 14914 is performed. In step 14914, the caching subsystem 11412 sends a message to the Enterprise server 314 to request retrieval of the identified portions of the identified patent from the databases 316.</p>
    <p>As should be clear by the above description of steps 14906, 14910, 14912, and 14914, the caching subsystem 11412 in the client 304,306 operates according to a caching methodology in which some data is stored in the local cache. When retrieving data, the Caching subsystem 11412 first looks in the local cache to determine whether the requested data is located in the local cache. If the data is not found in the local cache, then the Caching subsystem 11412 requests the data from the Enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>This caching methodology performed by the Caching subsystem 11412 in the client 304,306 represents a first level caching methodology according to the present invention. As mentioned above, the Enterprise server 314 performs a second level caching methodology. This second level caching methodology shall now be described.</p>
    <p>In step 14916, the Enterprise server 314 receives the message from the client 304,306. The Enterprise server 314 determines whether the identified portions of the identified patent (as indicated in the received message) are currently stored in the local cache of the Enterprise server 314. The local cache of the Enterprise server 314 is represented by the Main memory 1108 of the Enterprise server 314. In an alternative embodiment, the local cache of the Enterprise server 314 is represented by Cache memory in the Enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>If the identified portions of the identified patent are located in the local cache of the Enterprise server 314, then in step 14920 the Enterprise server 314 retrieves the identified portions of the identified patent from its local cache, and sends this retrieved data to the client 304,306.</p>
    <p>If, in step 14916, the Enterprise server 314 determines that the identified portions of the identified patent were not located in its local cache, then in step 14918 the Enterprise server 314 retrieves the identified portions of the identified patent from the databases 316. The Enterprise server 314 then in step 14920 returns this retrieved data to the client 304,306. The operation of flowchart 14902 is complete after the performance of step 14920, as indicated by step 14922.</p>
    <p>As described above, in an embodiment of the invention, the Enterprise server 314 retrieves and returns only the identified portions of the identified patent. In some cases, the Enterprise server 314 instead returns data representative of a plurality of patents, where such data includes the identified portions of the identified patent. This is called the bulk or cluster retrieval mode of the invention.</p>
    <p>Consider again FIG. 118. As described above, as the operator scrolls through the patents listed in the second panel 11706 of the console 11802, the caching subsystem 11412 sends requests to the Enterprise server 314 to retrieve additional patent data for display in the second panel 11706. When responding to such requests involving the console 11802, the Enterprise server 314 preferably returns patent data representative of a plurality of patents. Specifically, the Enterprise server 314 returns data representative of a patent cluster.</p>
    <p>A patent cluster represents a given number of patents. In an embodiment of the invention, the number of patents in a patent cluster is equal to 50, but this value is tuneable, and this value may be different for different contexts of the invention. When operating according to the cluster or bulk mode, the Enterprise server 314 in step 14916 determines whether the identified portions of the identified patent are in a cluster that is stored in the local cache of the Enterprise server 314. If the identified portions of the identified patent are in a cluster stored in the Enterprise server 314, then in step 14920 the Enterprise server 314 sends data representative of this cluster of patents to the client 304, 306. If, instead, the Enterprise server 314 determines in step 14916 that the identified portions of the identified patent are not in a cluster currently stored in the Enterprise server 314, then the Enterprise server in step 14918 retrieves data representative of the cluster from the databases 316. The Enterprise server 314 then, in step 14920, sends this retrieved information to the client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>Supporting both the domain layer 11408 and the broker layer 11410 is the persistence mapping layer 11414. The persistence layer 11414 is responsible for managing all interactions between the domain layer 11408 and a specific persistent storage device (not shown in FIG. 114). This decouples the domain objects from a particular physical representation, and enables various performance optimizations to be made.</p>
    <p>Supporting all aspects of the client 304, 306 is the abstract server interface 11416. This layer 11416 presents a logical server to the other layers of the client 304, 306. It is important to note that all interactions between the client 304, 306 and the enterprise server 314 take place using a high-level, patent-centric set of business decision system command objects. These command objects represent atomic transactions between the client 304, 306 and the enterprise server 314. These commands (or command objects) allow the client 304, 306 to communicate with the enterprise server 314 in a manner that decouples the client 304, 306 from any specific physical implementation of the enterprise server 314. For example, the enterprise server 314 could be running MS-DOS and storing objects in a flat file, or be running Unix and storing objects in Informix. As long as the enterprise server 314 responds to the set of command requests presented by the client 304, 306 through the abstract server interface 11416, the client 304, 306 will work correctly. These commands represent the Enterprise server API commands.</p>
    <p>The abstract server interface 11416 communicates to make a physical connection to the enterprise server 314. This is done through the network transport layer 11418, which is responsible for taking command objects and transmitting these command objects over a suitable communications network. The network transport layer 11418 also manages appropriate context information that is needed to manage a network connection. The network transport layer 11418: (a) does not require the physical presence of a network--it is possible to run the client 304, 306 and enterprise server 314 on the same physical machine and still have the system used properly; and (b) does not require the use of any specific network, even though one implementation of the system will be based on HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol).</p>
    <p>Additionally, general features of the architecture of FIG. 114 are described in Luke Hohmann, Journey of the Software Professional A Sociology of Software Development, Prentice Hall PTR, New Jersey, 1997, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p>Databases</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 6, some of the databases 316 are described in detail below. In particular, the document bibliographic databases 602, the group databases 621, the person databases 632, the employee databases 634, the security databases 636, the financial databases 638, and the methodology support databases 642 are described in detail below. Both the database structure and the methodology for extract and load of these databases are described below. The document databases 612, in particular the patent database 614, and the notes databases 640 are not described below since they are thoroughly covered in U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,681, U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,679, pending application Ser. No. 08/341,129, and pending application Ser. No. 08/590,082, all of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <p>The database structures of the document bibliographic databases 602, the group databases 621, the person databases 632, the employee databases 634, the security databases 636, the financial databases 638, and the methodology support databases 642 are shown in FIGS. 12B-12M. These figures also depict the interaction and connection between these databases. FIG. 12A illustrates the preferred orientation of FIGS. 12B-12M with respect to one another.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the tables and attributes shown in FIGS. 12B-12M only represent one embodiment of the present invention. The data in the databases 316 could be stored using other combinations of tables and attributes. Such other combinations of tables and attributes will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts based on the discussion contained herein. Accordingly, the tables and attributes are shown in FIGS. 12B-12M only for purposes of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>FIG. 45 is a generic dataflow diagram illustrating the general manner in which the databases 316 are loaded with data in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 95 is a flowchart 9502 representing the operation of this general extract and load procedure. In practice, the initial extract and load of the databases 316, and/or the updating of the databases 316, may be performed by employees of the customer and/or consultants retained by the customer.</p>
    <p>In step 9506, the customer provides data 4504 for upload into the databases 4508 being processed. The customer provided data 4504 is pertinent to the databases 4508. For example, if the databases 4508 are intended to store financial information, then the customer provided data 4504 would comprise financial information of interest to the customer, including possibly both the customer's financial information and financial information of competitors.</p>
    <p>In step 9508, a filter 4506 modifies the format of the customer provided data 4504 to conform to the database format of the databases 4508. The structure and operation of database filters, such as filter 4506, are well known.</p>
    <p>In step 9510, the formatted customer provided data is loaded into the databases 4508. More particularly, the formatted customer provided data 4504 is loaded into a portion of the databases 4508, called a first part 4510 of the databases 4508. Remaining portions of the databases 4508, called the second part 4512 of the databases 4508, cannot be loaded using only the formatted customer provided data 4504. Instead, loading of the second part 4512 may require other information 4516 pertinent to the databases 4508. Additionally, loading of the second part 4512 may require analysis of such additional information 4516 in conjunction with the information in the first part 4510 of the databases 4508. Such analysis is performed by operators 4514 with, potentially, the assistance of the system of the invention.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, in step 9512, other information 4516 pertinent to the databases 4508 is obtained.</p>
    <p>In step 9514, methodology reports 4518 are run, as needed. Such methodology reports 4518 represent the result of automatic processing and analysis of the databases 4508 with other tables in the databases 316. Such automatic processing and methodology reports are performed and generated by the enterprise server 314, and is described in detail below.</p>
    <p>In step 9516, operators 4514 analyze the customer provided data 4504 in the first part 4510 of the databases 4508. The operators 4514 may also analyze the other information 4516. In performing this analysis, the operators 4514 may refer to the methodology reports 4518 run in step 9514. Since these methodology reports 4518 were prepared by the enterprise server 314, the system of the invention assists the operators 4514 in performing this analysis. Based on the analysis of the operators 4514, additional database information for the databases 4508 is generated.</p>
    <p>In step 9518, this additional database information is loaded into the second part 4512 of the databases 4508. The databases 4508, at that point, are fully loaded. Periodically, the steps of flowchart 9502 must be repeated in order to update the databases 4508 with additional and/or modified customer provided data 4504 and/or additional and/or modified other information 4516.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment of the invention, data is not preloaded into the invention's databases. Instead, the invention accesses the customer's corporate databases for data on an as needed basis. This alternate embodiment is described below with respect to the BOM databases 626, but are applicable to the other tables in the databases 316 as well.</p>
    <p>Document Bibliographic Databases</p>
    <p>FIGS. 12B-12F and 12H illustrate the structure of the document bibliographic databases 602. As indicated in FIG. 6, the document bibliographic databases 602 include bibliographic databases for documents of interest to the customer. The patent bibliographic databases 604 include information about (i.e., bibliographic information) U.S. and/or foreign patents. Preferably, the patent bibliographic databases 604 have bibliographic information on all U.S. Patents and a subset of all foreign patents. As an alternative embodiment, the patent bibliographic databases 604 include (in addition to information on foreign patents) patent bibliographic information on only a subset of all U.S. patents, such as all U.S. patents available in electronic form from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or all U.S. patents that issued after a certain date, or all U.S. patents of interest to the customer.</p>
    <p>The patent bibliographic databases 604 include a patent table 1222 (FIG. 12H). The patent table 1222 includes a record for each U.S. and foreign patent represented in the patent bibliographic databases 604. Each record in the patent database 1222 includes a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute that stores a unique identifier (or key) for the associated patent. It is noted that, in the tables of the databases 316, the symbol FK stands for foreign key, AK stands for alternate key, and IE stands for inversion entry (which is a non-unique index).</p>
    <p>Each record of the patent database 1222 also includes attributes that, for the most part, correspond to the bibliographic information on the first page of U.S. patents. In an embodiment of the invention, each record of the patent database 1222 includes attributes that, for the most part, correspond to the bibliographic information contained in the electronic representations of U.S. patents publicly available from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
    <p>For example, a record in the patent database 1222 includes a document<sub>--</sub> number attribute that stores a patent number 4004 (see the example patent in FIG. 40). In an entry of the patent database 1222, the AppNo attribute corresponds to the application number 4014, the AppDate corresponds to the filing data 4016, the title corresponds to the title of the patent 4010, the issue date corresponds to the date that the patent issued 4006, the NumClaims corresponds to the number of claims in the patent 4036, the AsstExaminerLastName corresponds the last name of the assistant examiner 4032, the AsstExaminerFirstName corresponds to the first name of the assistant examiner 4032, the PrimaryExaminerLastName corresponds to the last name of the primary examiner 4030, and the PrimaryExaminerFirstName corresponds to the first name of the primary examiner 4030.</p>
    <p>Also in each record of the patent database 1222, the NumDrawingPages corresponds to the number of drawing sheets 4038, the disclaimer date corresponds to any terminal disclaimer 4106 (FIG. 41), the ReissueLevel, ReissueAppNo, ReissueAppDate, ReissuePatentNo, and ReissuelssueDate corresponds to any reissue information 4308, 4304, and 4306 (FIG. 43).</p>
    <p>Each record of the patent database 1222 also includes attributes that correspond to patent bibliographic information not shown on the front page of U.S. patents. For example, a record of the patent database 1222 also includes a SeriesCode that corresponds to the series code of the patent. Other information contained in each record of the patent database 1222 and not shown on the front page of the U.S. patent is the AppType, PubLevel, ArtUnit, ExemplaryClaimNo, NumFigures, NumSpecPages, TermYears, and IntlEdition. Each record of the patent database 1222 may also include fields whose values are calculated during the loading phase. For example, each record of the patent database 1222 may include a calc<sub>--</sub> exp<sub>--</sub> date that corresponds to the expiration date of the patent. This date is calculated and loaded into the patent database 1222 during the load phase of the patent database 1222 (described below). calc<sub>--</sub> exp<sub>--</sub> date and issue date are collectively referred to as patent term expiration related information.</p>
    <p>Each record of the patent database 1222 also includes one or more user<sub>--</sub> defined fields. Users may enter any information into this field. The amount of information that can be entered into this field is relatively large, such as 32 kbytes or greater. This field is preferably indexed searchable. The user can enter into this field information that is specific and/or of interest to his company. For example, a user may enter into this field its own matter or reference/tracking number.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the invention allows operators to add any number of additional user defined fields, both into the patent database 1222 and into any other table of the databases 316. The fields must be of certain predefined types, such as date fields, string fields, numeric fields, etc. The user can define the name of these fields and the types of these fields (from a number of available field types). Preferably, these fields are indexed and searchable.</p>
    <p>The record in the patent table 1222 corresponding to a particular patent is herein called the base record for the patent (because this record in the patent table 1222 includes most of the bibliographical information about the patent). The patent bibliographic databases 604 include other tables that store additional patent bibliographic information about each patent represented in the patent bibliographic databases 604. Records in these other tables are linked to their respective base records in the patent database 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute.</p>
    <p>An assignee table 1201 (FIG. 12B) includes information on the assignees of a patent, if any. A given patent may have multiple assignees. For each assignee of a patent, there is a record in the assignee table 1201. These assignee records in the assignee table 1201 are linked to the corresponding base record in the patent table 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute. Each record of the assignee table 1201 includes an assignee<sub>--</sub> id attribute which is an identifier that uniquely identifies the assignee. Each record of the assignee table 1201 also includes information pertaining to the assignee, such as country information, state information, the name of the assignee, and the city and zip code of the assignee. This information is found on the front page of U.S. patents (see field 4104 in FIG. 41). In each entry of the assignee table 1201, the country and state of the assignee as preferably specified using codes. These codes are defined in a state table 1207 and a country table 1210 (FIG. 12C).</p>
    <p>An intlclass table 1203 (FIG. 12B) stores information pertaining to the international class of a patent and the international search classes of the patent. For a given patent, the intlclass table 1203 includes a record for each international class to which the patent is assigned. Additionally, the intlclass table 1203 includes a record for each international search class which was searched during the prosecution of the patent. Whether a record in the intlclass table 1203 corresponds to an international class or an international search class is denoted by the attribute is<sub>--</sub> search<sub>--</sub> class. This attribute is set to true if the record corresponds to an international search class. Referring to FIG. 40, the international class is identified by reference number 4024. Not all patents have international search classes, and this is the case with the patent shown in FIG. 40. The records in the intlclass table 1203 are linked to the associated base record in the patent table 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute.</p>
    <p>The patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> xref table 1204 (FIG. 12B) includes information on the U.S. classification of a patent. For a given patent, the patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> xref table 1204 includes an entry for the original classification of a patent. The patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> xref table 1204 also includes an entry for each unofficial classification of the patent, and each digest classification of the patent. Whether or not a record in the patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> xref table 1204 corresponds to the original classification is denoted by an original attribute. Whether or not an entry in the patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> xref table 1204 corresponds to an unofficial classification or a digest classification is designated by a patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> type<sub>--</sub> id code, whose values are defined by a patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> type table 1202. Records in the patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> xref table 1204 are linked to the corresponding base record in the patent table 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute.</p>
    <p>A patent class/subclass is stored in a record of the patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> xref table 1204 using the patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> id attribute, the subclass<sub>--</sub> id attribute, and the suffix<sub>--</sub> id attribute. Consider the following class/subclass: 364/419.19. For this example, the patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> id is equal to 364. The subclass<sub>--</sub> id is equal to 419. The suffix<sub>--</sub> id attribute is equal to 19. By breaking the class/subclass into these three fields, it is possible to fine tune searches and direct searches to any combination of the class, subclass, or subclass suffix.</p>
    <p>The patent<sub>--</sub> class<sub>--</sub> id attribute is actually a code. The same is true of the subclass<sub>--</sub> id and the suffix<sub>--</sub> id attributes. These patent class codes are defined in a patent<sub>--</sub> class table 1209 (FIG. 12C).</p>
    <p>A RelatedApp table 1206 (FIG. 12B) stores information on applications which are related to a patent. For a given patent, the RelatedApp table 1206 includes a record for each application that is related to the patent. Related application data is shown, for example, in FIG. 44B at reference number 4490. Records in the RelatedApp table 1206 are linked to the associated base record in the patent table 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute. An entry in the RelatedApp table 1206 includes attributes to store the serial number of the related application, the filing date of the related application, the status of the related application, and the patent number and issue date of the related application, if the related application issued as a patent. Each entry of the RelatedApp table 1206 also includes a grammarcode attribute that stores a code corresponding to such text as "continuation of", "continuation-in-part," "which is a continuation-in-part of". These grammar codes are found in the electronic representations of U.S. patents publicly available from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
    <p>A LegalRepAttor table 1205 includes information on the attorney or agent who prosecuted the patent. Such information is shown in FIG. 40 at reference number 4034. There is a record in the LegalRepAttor table 1205 for each attorney or agent who prosecuted and is listed on the front page of the patent. Records in the LegalRepAttor table 1205 are linked to the corresponding base record in the patent table 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 12C, a PatentRef table 1208 stores information on U.S. patents that were cited during the prosecution of a given patent. The PatentRef table 1208 includes a record for each U.S. patent that was cited during the prosecution of a given patent. Such reference to U.S. patents are shown, for example, in FIG. 40 at reference number 4028. Each record of the PatentRef table 1208 includes a RefPatentNo attribute that represents the patent number of the reference patent. Each record of the PatentRef table 1208 also includes attributes that store the issue date of the reference patent, the first named inventor of the reference patent, and the class/subclass of the reference patent. Records in the PatentRef table 1208 are linked to the corresponding base record in the patent table 1222 using the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 12D, a SearchClass table 1211 stores information on U.S. classes and subclasses which were searched during the prosecution of a patent. For any given patent, the SearchClass table 1211 includes a record for each class/subclass that was searched during the prosecution of the patent. U.S. search class information is shown, for example, in FIG. 40 at reference number 4026. Records in the SearchClass table 1211 are linked to the corresponding base record in the patent table 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute.</p>
    <p>The inventor table 1212 includes information on the inventors of a patent. The inventor table 1212 includes a record for each inventor of a given patent. Records in the inventor table 1212 are linked to the corresponding base record in the patent table 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute. Inventorship information is shown, for example, in FIG. 44A by reference number 4450. Each record in the inventorship table 1212 includes an inventor<sub>--</sub> id attribute that stores a key that uniquely identifies the inventor. Each record of the inventorship table 1212 also includes attributes to identify the first and last name of the inventor, the address of the inventor, and the state and country of the inventor. The state and country values are specified by the state<sub>--</sub> id and the country<sub>--</sub> id attributes, which are codes. The state and country codes are defined in the state table 1207 and the country table 1210, respectively (FIG. 12C).</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 12E, the LegalRepFirm table 1213 includes information on the law firm that prosecuted the patent. There is one record in the LegalRepFirm table 1213 for each law firm that prosecuted the patent and that is shown on the front page of the patent. This law firm information is shown, for example, in FIG. 40 by reference number 4034. Records in the LegalRepFirm table 1213 are linked to the corresponding base record in the patent table 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute.</p>
    <p>The PatCoopTreaty table 1214 stores information on a PCT application, in those cases where the U.S. patent was first filed as a PCT application. Such PCT information is shown, for example, in FIG. 42 at reference number 4204. Records in the PatCoopTreaty table 1214 are linked to the corresponding base record in the patent table 1222 via the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute.</p>
    <p>The priority table 1215 includes priority information related to the patent. Such priority information is shown, for example, in FIG. 43 at reference number 4310. Records in the priority table 1215 are linked to the corresponding base record in the patent table 1222 by using the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 12F, the ForeignRef table 1216 includes information on foreign references that were cited during the prosecution of the patent. Such citations of foreign references are shown, for example, in FIG. 40 at reference number 4040. For a given patent, the ForeignRef table 1216 includes a record for each foreign reference that was cited against the patent. Each record of the ForeignRef table 1216 includes a ForeignPatentNo attribute that corresponds to the patent number of the foreign reference. Each record of the ForeignRef table 1216 also includes attributes that store information identifying the issue date of the foreign patent, the country of the foreign patent, and U.S. and international classes.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 6, the document bibliographic databases 602 include other bibliographic databases corresponding to documents that are of interest to the customer. In the example of FIG. 6, the document bibliographic databases 602 include deposition bibliographic databases 606, pleadings bibliographic databases 608, and prior art bibliographic databases 610. These databases may be of interest to the customer if, for example, the customer is involved in a patent litigation. Examples of the database structure of the deposition bibliographic databases 606, the pleadings bibliographic databases 608, and the prior art bibliographic databases 610 are shown in FIG. 12H. A depositions table 1225 corresponds to the deposition bibliographic databases 606. The depositions table 1225 includes a record for each deposition-related document that is of interest to the customer. Each record in the depositions table 1225 includes a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute that is a key that uniquely identifies the document. Each record of the depositions table 1225 also includes other bibliographic information about the deposition-related document, such as a deposition<sub>--</sub> id attribute that stores an identifier that identifies the deposition document. Each record of the depositions table 1225 may also include other bibliographic information such as the date that the deposition took place, the parties involved in the deposition, the number of pages of the deposition transcript, the place that the deposition took place, a summary of the deposition, etc.</p>
    <p>A pleadings table 1224 corresponds to the pleadings bibliographic databases 608. The pleadings table 1224 includes a record for each pleadings-related document that is of interest to the customer. Each record of the pleadings table 1224 includes a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute that stores a key that uniquely identifies the pleadings-related document. Each record of the pleadings database 1224 may also include other bibliographic information, such as a pleadings<sub>--</sub> id attribute. The pleadings table 1224 may include other attributes, such as attributes that identify the author of the pleadings, the date that the pleadings were created, the subject matter of the pleadings, the number of pages of the pleadings, the parties involved in the pleadings, the title of the pleadings, the type of the pleadings, etc.</p>
    <p>The prior<sub>--</sub> art table 1226 corresponds to the prior art bibliographic databases 610. There is a record in the prior<sub>--</sub> art table 1226 for each prior art reference that is of interest to the customer. Each reference of the prior<sub>--</sub> art table 1226 includes a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute that uniquely identifies the prior art reference. Each record of the prior<sub>--</sub> art table 1226 also includes other attributes, such as a prior<sub>--</sub> art<sub>--</sub> id attribute, and attributes to store information identifying the author of the prior art reference, the publication date of the prior art reference, the title of the prior art reference, the subject matter of the prior art reference, the number of pages of the prior art reference, etc.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 12H, a document table 1223 represents a table of the methodology support databases 642 (FIG. 6). The document table 1223 represents a master index of all of the documents represented in the document bibliographic databases 602. The document table 1223 has a record for each document represented in the patent bibliographic databases 604, the deposition bibliographic databases 606, the pleadings bibliographic databases 608, the prior art bibliographic databases 610, and any other bibliographic databases in the document bibliographic databases 602. Each record of the document table 1223 includes a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute that is a key that uniquely identifies a document. The document<sub>--</sub> id attribute is a common attribute in the document bibliographic databases 602, and serves to link the tables in the document bibliographic databases 602 together. Each record of the document table 1223 also includes a document<sub>--</sub> type attribute that identifies the type of the document (for example, whether the document is a patent, a deposition-related document, a pleadings-related document, a prior art-related document, etc.). Each record of the document table 1223 also includes a document<sub>--</sub> guid attribute that serves as a second identifier for the document, and a version<sub>--</sub> number attribute that identifies the version of the document.</p>
    <p>The document bibliographic databases 602 shall now be further described with reference to an example shown in FIGS. 13-17. FIG. 13 illustrates an example patent table 1222X. For simplicity, the example patent table 1222X only shows the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute and the document<sub>--</sub> number. The patent table 1222X stores therein bibliographic information on documents D1-D14, each of which corresponds to a patent.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14 is an example depositions table 1225X. For simplicity, only the document<sub>--</sub> id and the deposition<sub>--</sub> id attributes are shown. The depositions table 1225X stores bibliographic information on documents D15-D17, each of which represents a deposition-related document.</p>
    <p>FIG. 15 shows an example pleadings table 1224X. For simplicity, only the document<sub>--</sub> id and the pleadings<sub>--</sub> id attributes are shown. The pleadings table 1224X stores information on documents D18-D21, each of which corresponds to a pleadings-related document.</p>
    <p>FIG. 16 is an example prior<sub>--</sub> art table 1226X. For simplicity, only the document<sub>--</sub> id and the prior<sub>--</sub> art<sub>--</sub> id attributes are shown. The prior<sub>--</sub> art table 1226X stores information on documents D22 and D23, each of which represents a prior art-related document.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17 is an example document table 1223X. The document table 1223X includes an entry for each of the documents represented in the example patent table 1222X, the example depositions table 1225X, the example pleadings table 1224X, and the example prior<sub>--</sub> art table 1226X (shown in FIGS. 13-16, respectively). Accordingly, the document table 1223X has entries for documents D1-D23. For simplicity, only the document<sub>--</sub> id and the document<sub>--</sub> type attributes are shown in the example document table 1223X. The document<sub>--</sub> type attribute indicates the type of the document.</p>
    <p>The preferred procedure for loading the document bibliographic databases 602 shall now be described.</p>
    <p>FIG. 46 illustrates a data flow diagram of the loading of the patent bibliographic databases 604. FIG. 96 is a flowchart 9602 that corresponds to the data flow diagram 4602 of FIG. 46, and that represents the operation of the invention when loading bibliographic information of a given patent into the patent bibliographic databases 604.</p>
    <p>In step 9606, the patent text file 4604 and the patent image file 4624 of the patent being processed is received. For U.S. patents, electronic text and image files of patents are available from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Similarly, text and image files corresponding to foreign patents are available from foreign patent offices.</p>
    <p>In step 9608, an error detection and correction module 4612 in a parser 4610 analyzes the patent text file 4604 and detects any errors in the bibliographic data contained in the patent text file 4604. The error detection and correction module 4612 detects many types of errors. For example, an error which is detected by the error detection and correction module 4612 involves the issue date. With regard to patent text files 4604 received from the U.S. Patent Office, the issue date appears in the following format:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">ISD 19790315.</pre>
    
    <p>Thus, the issue date information is set off by the ISD token. This token is followed by four digits representing the year, two digits representing the month, and two digits representing the day. The error detection and correction module 4612 detects errors in the date given known date ranges. For example, the error detection and correction module would identify the following as an error:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">ISD 99790315</pre>
    
    <p>The error detection and correction module 4612 would detect this as an error, since the year value is out of range. The error detection and correction module 4612 operates in this manner to detect all date-related errors.</p>
    <p>Another error which the error detection and correction module 4612 detects involves state information and zip code information. The error detection and correction module 4612 correlates the state information and zip code information contained in the patent text file 4604 to determine if the zip code is possibly incorrect given the state, and vice versa. Such processing is possible, since each state is associated with a finite set of zip codes.</p>
    <p>Another error which the error detection and correction module 4612 detects involves the patent number. The patent number of a U.S. patent comprises seven digits. The error detection and correction module 4612 confirms that the patent number has seven digits, and detects an error if it does not. The error detection and correction module 4612 performs a similar function for non-U.S. patents, and other types of patent documents, such as reissues, reexams, etc.</p>
    <p>The patent number of a reissued patent has the token RE followed by five digits. The error detection and correction module 4612 detects an error if the patent number of a reissued patent does not follow this format.</p>
    <p>The detection performed by the error detection and correction module 4612 also involves street addresses. The error detection and correction module 4612 detects a possible error if the street address has no alphabetic characters, or has no space characters, or has no digit characters. Similarly, the error detection and correction module 4612 detects a possible error with the city name if the information in the patent text file 4604 corresponding to a city name has no alphabetic characters.</p>
    <p>The error detection and correction module 4612 performs additional error correction with regard to U.S. states by comparing information corresponding to U.S. state names from the patent text file 4604 with a list of the U.S. state abbreviations used by the U.S. Patent Office. If the state information does not match one of the state abbreviations, the error detection and correction module 4612 detects an error.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the error detection and correction module 4612 detects errors with information in the patent text file 4604 corresponding to country abbreviations by comparing such country information from the patent text file 4604 with the list of country codes utilized by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (and any other appropriate foreign patent office).</p>
    <p>The error detection and correction module 4612 also checks to ensure that mandatory data is contained in the patent text file 4604. Some bibliographic fields in the patent text file 4604 are mandatory, while others are optional. For example, the patent text file 4604 must contain document type information that identifies whether the patent is a utility patent, a design patent, a plant patent, a defensive publication, etc. In contrast, the patent text file 4604 may or may not include assignee information, since a patent does not have to have an assignee. The error detection and correction module 4612 checks for mandatory information, and detects an error if mandatory information is not contained in the patent text file 4604.</p>
    <p>Many fields in the patent text file 4604 must be in a proper format. Some of these fields were already discussed above, such as the patent number and date. Other fields which must be in a certain format are classes and subclasses, and dates. The error detection and correction module 4612 determines whether this information from the patent text file 4604 is in the proper format, and detects an error if they are not.</p>
    <p>Also in step 9608, the error detection and correction module 4612 automatically corrects the errors that it detects, where such automatic correction is possible. For example, given the patent number, the error detection and correction module 4612 can estimate the issue date. If the error detection and correction module 4612 detected an error with the issue date, then the error detection and correction module 4612 can attempt to automatically correct the error in the issue date based on the patent number (assuming that the patent number was found to contain no errors).</p>
    <p>If the error detection and correction module 4612 cannot automatically correct the errors that it detected, then the error detection and correction module 4612 notifies an operator 4616. The operator 4616 then manually corrects the error.</p>
    <p>The error detection and correction module 4612 also detects for errors in the information in the patent text file 4604 corresponding to assignees. The same company can be listed as assignee in different patents using different names. For example, IBM can be listed as the assignee in patents using various different names, such as IBM; International Business Machines; IBM, Inc.; etc. The error detection and correction module 4612 includes a thesaurus feature that lists the most commonly used names for well-known companies. The error detection and correction module 4612 compares the assignee name from the patent text file 4604 with this thesaurus and replaces the assignee information in the patent text file 4604 with the name retrieved from the thesaurus. Alternatively, the name retrieved from the thesaurus may be written to an appropriate user-defined field of the bibliographic databases 602.</p>
    <p>In step 9610, a formatting module 4614 in the parser 4610 formats the error detected and corrected patent text file 4604. This formatting is performed in order to convert the format of the patent text file 4604 to the format of the patent bibliographic databases 604. Such formatting includes formatting performed with respect to patent numbers. The required formats for different types of patents are presented in Table 4, below. It is noted that Table 4 is not a complete list, but just an illustrative one. Other types of patents (applicable in both the U.S. and foreign countries) could also be processed by the formatting module 4614.</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular">              TABLE 5______________________________________Type of Patent           Format______________________________________Utility patent           7Design patent            D6Plant patent             PP5Utility SIR              H7Design SIR               HD6Plant SIR                HP6Defensive publication    T6X patent                 X7Additional improvements patent                    AI4Non-patent literature    NP6Reissued utility patent  RE5Reissued design patent   RD5Reissued plant patent    RP5Reissued X patent        RX5______________________________________</pre>
    
    <p>The formatting module 4614 confirms that the information in the patent text file 4604 corresponding to patent numbers corresponds to the formats shown in Table 5. If the format is not as shown in Table 5, the formatting module 4614 modifies the patent text file 4604 so that the patent number conforms with the format of Table 5. For example, consider the format of a plant patent, which is a token PP immediately followed by five digits. Assume that the information in the patent text file 4604 was as follows: PP-11111 (for illustrative purposes, spaces are indicated as dashes). This patent number is not in the proper format because five digits do not immediately follow the PP token. Instead, there is a space between the PP token and the five digits. Accordingly, the formatting module 4614 modifies the patent text file 4604 so that the patent number is in the proper format. In the example above, the formatting module 4614 deletes the space between the PP token and the five digits.</p>
    <p>In step 9612, the parser 4610 generates a corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 from the error detected and corrected, and formatted patent text file 4604. The corrected and normalized patent text file includes both the text from the patent text file 4604 and the error detected and corrected, and formatted patent bibliographic information from the patent text file 4604.</p>
    <p>When generating the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618, the parser 4610 may take into consideration other patent information 4605. The parser 4610 may modify the information from the patent text file 4604 with this other patent information 4605 when generating the corrected and normalized patent text file 4619. For example, a patent is sometimes reassigned to another company after it issues. The new assignee, however, is not indicated on the front page of the patent (because the patent was published before the reassignment took place). Often, patent reassignment information is in the assignment records of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (if such information was recorded with the USPTO). Such assignment records may constitute part of the other patent information 4605. The parser 4610 in generating the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 may take into account such assignment information when generating the corrected and normalized patent text file. For example, the parser 4610 may include a note in the corresponding record of the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 that the patent has been reassigned, and indicate the new assignee(s). This note may be, for example, in a field of the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 corresponding to the user defined attribute in the record of the patent table 1222 (FIG. 12H).</p>
    <p>The patent bibliographic information in the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 is stored in normalized format. Preferably, this normalized format is a condensed, field delimited format. Essentially, in normalizing the patent bibliographic information from the patent text file 4604, the parser 4610 separates the patent bibliographic information into fields that correspond to the attributes in the patent bibliographic databases 604. These fields are delimited either using commas, tabs, or some other symbol.</p>
    <p>For example, the format of a class/subclass in the patent text file 4604 is as follows: XCL---17-34-2 (for illustrative purposes, spaces are indicated as dashes). Therefore, in the patent text file 4604, a class/subclass is denoted by the token XCL, followed by two spaces. Three characters follow this token that correspond to the class. This is followed by three characters that correspond to the subclass. Finally, two characters follow the subclass. These two characters correspond to the suffix. In the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618, this class/subclass information is represented in a field delimited format, as follows: 17, 34, 2. This is a comma delimited format. In other embodiments, the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 uses a tab delimited format for the patent bibliographic information.</p>
    <p>In step 9614, the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 is used to regenerate the patent text file 4604. The regenerated patent text file is designated by reference number 4608. A comparison module 4606 then compares the patent text file 4604 with the regenerated patent text file 4608. If the regenerated patent text file 4608 differs from the patent text file 4604, then the comparison module 4606 determines that the parser 4610 incorrectly generated the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 from the patent text file 4604. If such an error is detected, then the comparison module 4606 notifies an operator 4616. It is noted that step 9614 is optional.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 represents an object-oriented framework. Generating the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 as a framework is useful because it can then be easily exported to a number of different formats, for later processing. Accordingly, in step 9616, the corrected and normalized patent text file is stored in various formats for later retrieval. Such formats may include a human editable production format 4620, and/or a SPML format 4622. It is noted that step 9616 is optional.</p>
    <p>In step 9618, the corrected and normalized patent text file is paginated by a pagination module 4626 to generate a patent equivalent text file 4630. The patent equivalent text file 4630 includes equivalency information that establishes an equivalency relationship between the text in the patent equivalent text file 4630 and the image in the patent image file 4624. For example, this equivalency information includes pagination information that enables the patent equivalent text file 4630 to be displayed having the same pagination (line breaks, column breaks, page breaks) as the patent image file 4624. The pagination module 4626 generates the patent equivalent text file 4630 by comparing the patent text in the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618 with the patent image file 4624 to detect equivalency information. This equivalency information is then embedded in the patent equivalent text file 4630, along with the patent text. While the pagination module 4626 is capable of performing the pagination operation automatically, in some cases some manual intervention is required. In accordance, an operator 4628 is sometimes involved with the pagination process performed by the pagination module 4626. The pagination process performed by the pagination module 4626 is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,681, U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,679, and pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/341,129, all of which are incorporated by reference herein. It is noted that step 9618 is optional.</p>
    <p>In step 9620, a patent bibliographic flat file 4619 is generated from the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618. The patent bibliographic flat file 4619 includes the normalized patent bibliographic information from the corrected and normalized patent text file 4618. Preferably, the patent bibliographic flat file 4619 does not include the patent text. The patent bibliographic flat file 4619 is generated using standard database utilities.</p>
    <p>In step 9622, the patent bibliographic information in the patent bibliographic flat file 4619 is loaded into the tables of the patent bibliographic databases 604. This loading operation is performed by using standard database loading utilities.</p>
    <p>After completion of step 9622, the patent bibliographic information from the patent being processed is completely loaded into the patent bibliographic databases 604. The steps of flowchart 9602 are repeated for each patent that is to be represented in the patent bibliographic databases 604.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 6, the loading of the deposition bibliographic databases 606, the pleadings bibliographic databases 608, and the prior art bibliographic databases 610 (and any other bibliographic databases in the document bibliographic databases 602) is conducted generally according to the methodology shown in FIGS. 46 and 96 for U.S. patents. More generally, the extract and load for these bibliographic databases may be performed according to the methodology shown in FIGS. 45 and 95, described above. The actual implementation of the extract and load methodologies for these bibliographic databases will necessarily be case specific and depend on a number of factors, including the bibliographic information contained in the source documents, the format of the source documents (that is, whether or not they are electronically stored, the storage format, how bibliographic data is represented in the storage format, etc.), etc. The extract and load processes for these other bibliographic databases will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the discussion contained herein.</p>
    <p>Group Databases</p>
    <p>The group databases 621 are described below. In particular, the structure of the group databases 621 and the methodologies for loading the group databases 621 with data are described in the following sections.</p>
    <p>User Defined Groups</p>
    <p>FIG. 12I depicts the user-defined group (also called arbitrary group) databases 624. A group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 has a record for each user-defined group. Each record in the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 includes a group<sub>--</sub> id attribute that stores a key that uniquely identifies the user-defined group from all other user-defined groups. Each record of the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 also includes a group<sub>--</sub> guid which is an alternate key (identifier) of the record, a name attribute that stores the name of the user-defined group, a creation<sub>--</sub> date attribute that stores the date that the group was created, a modification<sub>--</sub> date attribute that stores the date that the group was last modified, a version<sub>--</sub> number attribute that stores the version number of the group, a description attribute that stores a description of the group, and an owner<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies the owner (that is, the creator) of the user-defined group.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, groups are hierarchically organized. In other words, a given group can be a child of one or more parent groups, and can also be a parent to one or more child groups. This hierarchical organization is illustrated by way of example in FIG. 18, which is an example screen shot 1801 displayed by the client grouping module 712 on the client display unit 1122. This screen shot 1801 includes a first window 1802 and a second window 1804. The first window 1802 graphically depicts the hierarchical organization of the groups, both user-defined and predefined. The highest level group is called the root group, or repository. A BOM group is a child of the root group. The BOM group is a pre-defined group and is discussed below.</p>
    <p>A user-defined group is also a child of the root group. The user-defined group has a number of child groups. These child groups are user-defined groups. In the example, the child groups are: companies to acquire, patents about bikes, and litigation. The companies to acquire user-defined group has a number of child user-defined groups. They include: ABC Corp., XYZ Corp., and PQR Corp.</p>
    <p>The hierarchical structure of the user-defined groups is defined by information in a group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229 (FIG. 12I). The group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229 includes a record for each parent/child relationship in the user-defined group hierarchical structure. Each record of the group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229 includes a parent attribute and a group<sub>--</sub> id attribute. Both the parent attribute and the group<sub>--</sub> id attribute store group<sub>--</sub> id values. The parent attribute stores the group<sub>--</sub> id of the parent group, and the group<sub>--</sub> id stores the group<sub>--</sub> id of the child group.</p>
    <p>The group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 and the group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229 shall be further described with reference to an example illustrated in FIGS. 19 and 20. FIG. 19 illustrates an example group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227X that includes information representative of the user-defined group hierarchical structure shown in FIG. 18. The example group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227X in FIG. 19 has a record for each user-defined group shown in FIG. 18. Accordingly, there is an entry in the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227X for the following user-defined groups: companies to acquire, ABC Corp., XYZ Corp., PQR Corp., patents about bikes, and litigation. The group<sub>--</sub> id values of these user-defined groups are GRP1-GRP6, respectively. Note that the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227X has no information pertaining to the hierarchical structure of the user-defined groups. Instead, such information on the hierarchical structure of the user-defined groups is contained in the group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229.</p>
    <p>FIG. 20 illustrates an example group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229X. The group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229X has entries that define parent/child relationships in the user-defined groups hierarchical structure. For example, an entry 2002 specifies that the parent attribute is GRP1 (corresponding to the companies to acquire group), and the group<sub>--</sub> id attribute is GRP2 (corresponding to the ABC Corp. group). Therefore, entry 2002 in the group<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> xref table 1229X specifies that the ABC Corp. group is a child of the companies to acquire group. Similarly, the entry 2004 specifies that the XYZ Corp. group is a child of the companies to acquire group, and entry 2006 specifies that the PQR Corp. group is a child of the companies to acquire group.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 12I, a user-defined group can contain any number of documents, such as patents. The documents in a group are considered to be relevant to the group. In practice, a user places the documents in a group.</p>
    <p>A group<sub>--</sub> document<sub>--</sub> xref table 1228 stores information that identifies the documents that are in each user-defined group. The group<sub>--</sub> document<sub>--</sub> xref table 1228 includes a record for each document in each user-defined group. Each record of the group<sub>--</sub> document<sub>--</sub> xref table 1228 stores a group<sub>--</sub> id attribute to identify the user-defined group, a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute to identify a document in that group, and a modification<sub>--</sub> date attribute that stores the date that the record in the group<sub>--</sub> document<sub>--</sub> xref table 1228 was last modified.</p>
    <p>The group<sub>--</sub> document<sub>--</sub> xref table 1228 shall be further described with reference to an example shown in FIG. 21. FIG. 21 illustrates an example group<sub>--</sub> document<sub>--</sub> xref table 1228X. The example in FIG. 21 indicates that documents D1-D3 are in the user-defined group having the group<sub>--</sub> id of GRP2 (that is, the ABC Corp. group). Documents D7 and D8 are in the XYZ Corp. group; documents D11 and 12 are in the PQR Corp. group; documents D1-D3 and D9 are in the patents about bikes group; documents D22, D23, D18, D21, D16 and D1 are in the litigation group.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 18, note that the user has selected the ABC Corp. group in the window 1802 (this is indicated by the dotted circle 1850). Selection of a group in window 1802 results in a listing of the documents in the selected group being displayed in a window 1804. Accordingly, a list including documents D1-D3 is displayed in window 1804. Other bibliographic information pertaining to these documents can also be displayed in window 1804 in a tabular or "spreadsheet" format by retrieving such bibliographic information from the appropriate tables in the document bibliographic databases 602.</p>
    <p>A user can view a document by double-clicking (or use any other well known GUI technique) on that document in the window 1804. In the example of FIG. 18, the user has selected document D1 (indicated by dotted circle 1852). This results in the document being displayed in a window 1806. The window 1806 includes a window 1808, where the text of document D1 is displayed, and/or a window 1810, where the image of document D1 is displayed. The example of window 1806 where text and images of a document are selectively displayed is more particularly shown in FIG. 112. An example of screen shot 1801 where the user-defined group hierarchical structure is shown in one window 1802 and a list of documents is displayed in another window 1804 is more particularly shown in FIG. 58.</p>
    <p>The procedures for initially loading the user-defined group databases 624 with data generally track the generic extract and load procedures illustrated in FIGS. 45 and 96. Such an initial extract and load procedure will only be required if any user-defined groups exist prior to initiation of the enterprise server 314 for a particular customer. If the customer does not have any user-defined groups prior to initiating the enterprise server 314 for the first time, then the user-defined group databases 624 will be loaded with information as the user creates and modifies user-defined groups.</p>
    <p>Predefined Group Databases</p>
    <p>The predefined group databases 622 (also called system defined group databases) are described in the following sections.</p>
    <p>Bill of Materials (BOM) Databases</p>
    <p>A bill of materials (BOM) is a well-known data structure often used by companies to abstractly represent a product. A BOM is a hierarchical and recursive data structure that identifies the subassemblies of a product, and that identifies the parts of the subassemblies. Accordingly, a product's BOM is useful for recording the sub-assemblies and parts needed to construct the product. BOMs are also called herein BOM data structures, or BOM structures, or BOM trees.</p>
    <p>FIG. 22 illustrates an example BOM 2202 for a bicycle. The bicycle is the product (also called the assembly). As indicated in FIG. 22, the bicycle includes a frame, two wheels, and a handle bar (only a portion of the BOM for the bicycle is shown for simplicity purposes).</p>
    <p>The frame, the two wheels, and the handle bar are subassemblies because they each are composed of one or more subassemblies or parts. For example, the frame subassembly includes a screw, which is a part. A part is defined as an item which does not have component parts separately represented in the BOM. Each of the two wheel subassemblies includes a rim and a tire, which are both parts. The handlebar subassembly includes a metal rod and two hand grips, all three of which are parts.</p>
    <p>Although not indicated in the example of FIG. 22, a subassembly may be composed of any combination of parts and/or subassemblies.</p>
    <p>The BOM 2202 in FIG. 22 includes a number of nodes, called BOM nodes. A node corresponds to each assembly (i.e., the bicycle node), each subassembly (i.e., the frame, wheel, and handle bar nodes), and each part (i.e., the screw, rim, tire, metal rod, and hand grip nodes).</p>
    <p>In the context of and as applied by the present invention, each BOM node has a logical level in the hierarchical structure of the BOM. According to an embodiment of the invention, there are three BOM logical levels (although a customer can define others): assembly, subassembly, and part. Accordingly, the logical level of the bicycle node is assembly. The logical level of the frame, wheel, and handle bar nodes is subassembly. The logical level of the screw, rim, tire, metal rod, and hand grip is part.</p>
    <p>In the invention, the reason for using logical levels is to enable enhanced reporting and analysis functions, such as the reporting functions described herein that are organized according to BOM logical level. As discussed above, an advantage of predefined groups is that their structure and attributes are better defined and more extensive than user-defined groups. Accordingly, more extensive and more useful analysis and reporting functions can be developed for predefined groups.</p>
    <p>FIG. 23A illustrates an example BOM 2302 of a lawn mower. The lawn mower includes a frame, an engine, and a handlebar. These are all subassemblies (although for simplicity purposes the engine subassembly is not further defined in the BOM 2302 shown in FIG. 23A). The frame subassembly includes a screw. The handlebar subassembly includes two hand grips. The screw and the hand grips are parts. It is noted that the screw part in the bicycle BOM 2202 is the same physical part as the screw part in the lawnmower BOM 2302. Similarly, the hand grip part in the bicycle BOM 2202 is the same physical part as the handgrip part in the lawnmower BOM 2302. However, the frame subassembly in the bicycle BOM 2202 is not the same physical part as the frame subassembly in the lawnmower BOM 2302. Also, the handle bar subassemblies in the bicycle BOM 2202 and the lawnmower BOM 2302 are not the same.</p>
    <p>FIG. 23B illustrates a portion of a BOM of an example antique car. This BOM includes a body subassembly, and two wheel subassemblies. In the present example, these wheel subassemblies are the same as the wheel subassemblies in FIG. 22. As discussed below, these wheel subassemblies are represented as a single BOM group in the BOM databases 626. Both the BOM group corresponding to the bicycle and the BOM group corresponding to the antique car include the wheel BOM group (that is, the wheel BOM group is a child group of the bicycle BOM group and the antique car BOM group). That is, the wheel BOM group is shared by the bicycle BOM group and the antique car BOM group. Accordingly, the wheel BOM group is herein called a shared group.</p>
    <p>The BOM databases 626 are illustrated in FIG. 12G. A BOM table 1217 includes a record for each unique BOM node of each BOM of interest. Accordingly, each record in the BOM table 1217 represents a BOM node in a BOM of interest to the customer.</p>
    <p>The BOM table 1217 includes entries for only unique BOM nodes of interest. Again referring to FIG. 22, the two wheel subassembly BOM nodes are not unique with respect to each other. Therefore, the BOM table 1217 only includes a single record for the wheel BOM node. Similarly, the screw node in the BOMs of FIGS. 22 and 23 represent the same physical part. Accordingly, the BOM table 1217 only includes one record for the screw part.</p>
    <p>Each record in the BOM table 1217 includes a BOM<sub>--</sub> id attribute which stores a key that is unique to the associated BOM node. Each record of the BOM table 1217 also includes a BOM<sub>--</sub> guid representing an alternate key of the record, a name attribute storing a name of the BOM node, a level<sub>--</sub> id attribute representing the logical level of the BOM node (that is, whether the BOM node represents an assembly, a subassembly, a part, etc.), a status<sub>--</sub> id attribute representing the status of the BOM node in the customer's business (that is, whether the part, subassembly, or assembly represented by the BOM node is in production, is discontinued, is contemplated for a future product, etc.), a creation<sub>--</sub> date attribute identifying the date that the record was created, a modification<sub>--</sub> date attribute indicating the date that the BOM record was last modified, and a version<sub>--</sub> number attribute identifying the version of the BOM record.</p>
    <p>The level<sub>--</sub> id attribute is actually a code. The values of the level<sub>--</sub> id codes are defined in a BOM<sub>--</sub> level table 1220. Similarly, the status<sub>--</sub> id attribute is a code whose values are defined in a BOM<sub>--</sub> status table 1221.</p>
    <p>As evident by the examples of FIGS. 22 and 23, a BOM is a hierarchical and recursive structure, where each node in the structure may be a child of multiple parent nodes, and/or may itself have multiple child nodes. Information pertaining to this BOM hierarchical structure is not contained in the BOM table 1217. Instead, this information is contained in the BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219.</p>
    <p>The BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219 includes a record for each parent/child relationship in the BOMs represented in the BOM table 1217. Each record of the BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219 includes a parent<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> id attribute and a BOM<sub>--</sub> id attribute. The parent<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> id attribute stores the BOM<sub>--</sub> id of the parent BOM node, and the BOM<sub>--</sub> id attribute stores the BOM<sub>--</sub> id of the child BOM node. Each record of the BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219 also includes a sort<sub>--</sub> order attribute which specifies the order in which the records in the BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219 should be displayed or printed, when an appropriate command is received from the user. The value of the sort<sub>--</sub> order attribute is set to a default value, which is preferably 100. The user may change this value to any other number, either below or above 100. When printing or displaying the records of the BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219, such records are printed or displayed in ascending or descending order (as indicated in the user command) based on the sort<sub>--</sub> order attribute.</p>
    <p>The BOM table 1217 and the BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219 shall be further described by reference to examples shown in FIGS. 24-25. FIG. 24 includes an example BOM table 1217X and FIG. 25 illustrates an example BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219X. These tables in FIGS. 24 and 25 store data corresponding to the example BOMs 2202 and 2302 shown in FIGS. 22 and 23, respectively. Accordingly, the example BOM table 1217X in FIG. 24 includes an entry for each BOM node in the bicycle BOM 2202 and the lawnmower BOM 2302. For simplicity purposes, only the BOM<sub>--</sub> id attribute and the name attribute are shown in the example BOM table 1217X. Accordingly, the BOM table 1217 includes an entry for the bicycle assembly, the bicycle frame subassembly, the screw part, the wheel subassembly, the rim part, the tire part, the bicycle handle bar subassembly, the metal rod part, the hand grip part, the lawnmower assembly, the lawnmower frame subassembly, the engine subassembly, and the lawnmower handle bar subassembly.</p>
    <p>Information pertaining to the hierarchical structure of the bicycle BOM 2202 and the lawnmower 2302 is contained in an example BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219X shown in FIG. 25. The BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219X includes a record for each parent/child relationship in the BOM tables 2202 and 2302. Accordingly, record 2502 in the BOM<sub>--</sub> BOM<sub>--</sub> xref table 1219X indicates that BOM node 2 is a child of BOM node 1. In other words, record 2502 indicates that the bicycle frame node is a child of the bicycle node. Similarly, record 2504 indicates that the screw node is a child of the bicycle frame node, record 2506 indicates that the wheel node is a child of the bicycle node, record 2508 indicates that the rim node is a child of the wheel node, and record 2510 indicates that the tire node is a child of the wheel node. Further, record 2512 indicates that the bicycle handlebar node is a child of the bicycle node; record 2514 indicates that the metal rod node is a child of the bicycle handlebar node; record 2516 indicates that the handgrip node is a child of the bicycle handlebar node; record 2518 indicates that the lawnmower frame node is a child of the lawnmower node; record 2520 indicates that the screw node is a child of the lawnmower frame node; record 2522 indicates that the engine node is a child of the lawnmower node; record 2524 indicates that the lawnmower handle bar node is a child of the lawnmower node; and record 2526 indicates that the hand grip node is a child of the lawnmower handle bar node.</p>
    <p>A BOM group represented in the BOM table 1217 may contain any number of documents. Preferably, the documents in a BOM group include patents that map to the BOM group. In other words, the documents in a BOM group include patents that map to the product represented by the BOM node corresponding to the BOM group in the BOM table 1217. As used herein, the term "product" refers to any assembly, subassembly, or part in a BOM.</p>
    <p>A BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218 stores information that identifies the documents in a BOM group. The BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218 includes a record for each document in each BOM group. Each record of the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218 includes a BOM<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies the BOM group, and a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies the document that is in that BOM group.</p>
    <p>FIG. 26 illustrates an example BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218X that corresponds to the example in FIGS. 24 and 25. The example BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218X indicates that documents D1 and D2 are in the bicycle BOM group. Documents D1 and D2 are patents (see FIG. 17). Accordingly, the patents having document<sub>--</sub> ids D1 and D2 map to the BOM group having BOM<sub>--</sub> id 1 (that is, the bicycle assembly).</p>
    <p>The preferred methodology for initially loading the BOM databases 626 is represented by a data flow diagram in FIG. 47 and a corresponding flowchart 9702 in FIG. 97. In step 9706, customer BOM data is received. Typically, a customer will have his own database that stores BOM data. In preparation for performing step 9706, the customer exports the BOM data from his database into a computer file. This computer file is represented as the customer BOM data 4704 in FIG. 47.</p>
    <p>In step 9708, a BOM filter 4706 formats the customer BOM data 4704 so as to conform with the format of the BOM databases 626. The formatting done by the BOM filter 4706 may be minor or extensive, depending on whether, during the extract of the BOM data from the customer's databases, the customer was able to format the extracted data (represented as the customer BOM data 4704) in a format that closely matched the format of the BOM databases 626. Database filters, such as the BOM filter 4706, for formatting data in preparation for upload to a database are well-known.</p>
    <p>In some embodiments, the invention includes a filter that is specific to the database format of the BOM databases 626 (this is true for all filters discussed herein--that is, the filters are specific to their respective databases). The structure and operation of this specialized filter will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the discussion herein, particularly the discussion of the database formats.</p>
    <p>In step 9710, the formatted customer BOM data 4704 is loaded into a portion of the BOM databases 626. This portion is indicated as the first part 4708 in FIG. 47. It is not possible to load the remaining parts of the BOM databases 626, indicated as the second part 4710, using only the customer BOM data 4704, since the customer BOM data 4704 probably does not include the data attributes represented by the second part 4710. For example, the customer BOM data 4704 probably does not contain BOM logical level information or status information required by attributes in the BOM table 1217. Additionally, the customer BOM data 4704 will not include the patent mapping information (that is, an identification of which patents/documents map to which BOM groups) required by the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218.</p>
    <p>In step 9712, data on the customer's products is obtained. This data is obtained from the customer, such as the customer's production department or R&amp;D department, and pertains to the status of the products (such as whether the products or parts are currently in production, whether they are contemplated for future production, whether they are discontinued, etc.).</p>
    <p>In step 9714, patent related information is obtained. This patent related information may include, for example, a list of the customer's patents, and a list of competitor patents. Bibliographic information on these patents are loaded into the patent bibliographic databases 604 in the manner described above, to the extent that the patent bibliographic databases 604 do not already include patent bibliographic information on these patents.</p>
    <p>In step 9716, operators 4712 may run methodology reports which will be later used to aid in the analysis of the data gathered in prior steps. The methodology reports which may be run include a patent mapping report (described below). The patent mapping report may be incomplete due to the lack of information in the BOM databases 626. However, even an incomplete patent mapping report may be useful to aid in the analysis of the data.</p>
    <p>In step 9718, operators 4712 analyze the customer BOM data 4704, the product data 4716, and the patent related information 4714 to determine, for each BOM group, the BOM level, the BOM status, and the documents (that is, patents) that map to the BOM groups. For example, the operators 4712 will analyze the BOM data and the product data to determine the status (that is, whether discontinued, in production, contemplated for future production, etc.) of the BOM node associated with each BOM group. Additionally, the operators 4712 will analyze the customer BOM data 4704 and the patent related information to identify patents which map to the BOM group (that is, patents which map to the products represented by the BOM nodes corresponding to the BOM groups).</p>
    <p>In step 9720, the information generated in step 9718 is loaded into the appropriate attribute fields of the BOM databases 626 (i.e., the second part 4710 of the BOM databases 626).</p>
    <p>The steps of flowchart 9702 are periodically performed to update the BOM databases 626 with changes in BOMs, patents that map to BOMs, production changes, new products and features, etc.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment, the BOM databases 626 are not preloaded in the manner shown in FIG. 47 and discussed with reference to FIG. 97. Instead, referring to FIG. 48, BOM data is downloaded from a corporate BOM database 4808 via a corporate BOM database management system 4806 to the enterprise server 314 when needed. A translator 4804 translates the customer BOM data from the format of the corporate BOM database 4808 to the required format of the BOM databases 626 in the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>It is noted that this alternative embodiment could also be used with the other tables of the databases 316.</p>
    <p>The approach of FIG. 48 is advantageous because the enterprise server 314 is assured of receiving and, accordingly, processing the most up to date BOM data. The disadvantage of the approach in FIG. 48 is that, typically, analysis of a customer corporation takes a number of weeks. During that period of analysis, the BOM data should be stable. In other words, during the period of analysis, the analysis should be conducted on a snapshot of the customer's BOM data. The approach illustrated in FIG. 48 would not lend this stability, since the corporate BOM database 4808 will no doubt change during the course of the analysis period. Accordingly, the enterprise server 314 when downloading BOM data from the corporate BOM database 4808 will be working with different versions of the BOM data at different times. In contrast, the approach of FIGS. 47 and 97 provide the desired stability of the BOM data during the analysis period.</p>
    <p>BOM groups (and, in fact, any predefined group) can also be represented using user-defined groups as long as the operator is willing to abstract and map the BOM group attributes to the attributes supported by the user-defined groups. Such definition of BOM groups may be useful with BOMs that change frequently but core technologies change slowly, as in consumer products.</p>
    <p>Corporate Entity Databases</p>
    <p>A corporate entity is considered to be a predefined group because any number of documents can be associated with the corporate entity. These documents are preferably relevant and of interest to the corporate entity. For example, the documents could be patents that are owned, licensed, or otherwise of interest to the corporate entity.</p>
    <p>The corporate entity databases 630 include information on the customer corporation, the corporations associated or affiliated with the customer corporation, and/or corporations that are otherwise of interest to the customer corporation, such as the customer corporation's competitors or potential competitors.</p>
    <p>The corporate entity databases 630 are shown in FIG. 12J. A corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 includes a record for each corporate entity of interest. In each record of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 includes a corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute that stores a key that is unique to the corporate entity. Each record of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity database 1230 also incudes a corp<sub>--</sub> level<sub>--</sub> id attribute that specifies the level of the corporate entity in its respective corporate structure (it is noted that data pertaining to one or many corporate structures may be stored in the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230). Possible values of the corp<sub>--</sub> level<sub>--</sub> id attribute include parent corporation, subsidiary corporation, franchise, headquarters, etc. A name attribute stores the name of the corporate entity.</p>
    <p>Information on the corporate structure is also stored in the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230. In particular, each entry of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 includes a parent<sub>--</sub> corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute. This attribute stores the corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id of the immediate parent corporation of the corporate entity.</p>
    <p>A sort<sub>--</sub> order attribute stores information that identifies the order in which the records of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity database 1230 should be displayed or printed when requested by the user. The sort<sub>--</sub> order attribute is set to a default value of preferably 100. The user can change this value of the sort<sub>--</sub> order attribute. The records of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 are displayed and printed according to the sort<sub>--</sub> order attribute in the records. In particular, the records of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 are displayed or printed in ascending or descending order (specified by the user) of the sort<sub>--</sub> order attributes in the records.</p>
    <p>The corp<sub>--</sub> level<sub>--</sub> id attribute is implemented as a code whose values are defined in a corporate<sub>--</sub> level database 1232.</p>
    <p>A primary<sub>--</sub> corp database 1231 stores the corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id of the customer corporation. This primary<sub>--</sub> corp table 1231 is referenced when the enterprise server 314 needs to identify who the customer is during analysis operations. For example, if the user requests a listing of all patents owned by the customer corporation, the enterprise server 314 refers to the primary<sub>--</sub> corp table 1231 to identify who the customer is, and then refers to the corp<sub>--</sub> patents<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233 (described below) to identify all patents owned by the corporate customer.</p>
    <p>A corporate entity group represented in the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 can include any number of documents, such as any number of patents. Typically, the patents in a corporate entity group represent patents for which the corporate entity has some interest, such as patents owned by the corporate entity, patents assigned to the corporate entity, or patents that, for whatever reason, the corporate entity is analyzing. A corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233 stores information that identifies the documents contained in each corporate entity group. The corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233 includes a record for each document in each corporate entity group.</p>
    <p>Each record of the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233 includes a corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies the corporate entity group, and a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies the document that is in the corporate entity group.</p>
    <p>Each record of the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233 also includes an ownership<sub>--</sub> id attribute and a relevance<sub>--</sub> id attribute. The ownership<sub>--</sub> attribute identifies the relationship of the document to the corporate entity. Possible values of the ownership<sub>--</sub> id attribute include owned, assigned, interested in, etc. The ownership<sub>--</sub> id attribute is implemented as a code whose values are defined by a patent<sub>--</sub> ownership table 1234, and are ultimately under the control of (i.e., defined by) the customer.</p>
    <p>The relevance<sub>--</sub> id attribute identifies the relevance of the document to the corporate entity. Preferably, the possible values of the relevant<sub>--</sub> id attribute are core and non-core. A relevance of core indicates that the patent (identified by the document<sub>--</sub> id) maps to an assembly, subassembly or part that is currently in production, or that is contemplated for future production, or for some other reason is important to the corporate entity. As discussed above, such assemblies, subassemblies and parts are represented in the BOM table 1217 as BOM groups. A non-core relevancy value indicates that the patent either does not map to any assembly, subassembly or part of interest or that the patent maps to an assembly, subassembly, or part that is currently discontinued, or that, for whatever reason the corporate entity does not have great interest in the patent. The relevance<sub>--</sub> id attribute is implemented as a code whose values are specified in a relevance table 1235, and are ultimately under the control of (i.e., defined by) the customer.</p>
    <p>The corporate entity databases 630 shall be further described with reference to an example in FIGS. 33-36. These figures correspond to an example corporate structure 3202 illustrated in FIG. 32, wherein corp1 has two child corporations, corp2 and corp3, and corp3 has a child corporation, corp4. Corp5 is a competitor of Corp1.</p>
    <p>FIG. 33 illustrates an example corporate<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> table 1230X. For simplicity purposes, only the corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute, the corp<sub>--</sub> level<sub>--</sub> id attribute, and the parent<sub>--</sub> corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute are shown in FIG. 33. The corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230X has a record for each corporate entity of interest (that is, the corporate entities shown in FIG. 32). Each of these records in the corporatre<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230X represents a corporate entity group that may contain any number of documents. Record 3304 in the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230X indicates that corp2 is a subsidiary of corp1. Similarly, record 3306 indicates that corp3 is a subsidiary of corp1, and record 3308 indicates that corp4 is a subsidiary of corp3.</p>
    <p>Note that corp5 in FIG. 32 is not a part of the corporate structure that includes corp1, corp2, corp3 and corp4. In the example of FIG. 32, corp5 is a competitor of corp1.</p>
    <p>The corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230X also includes a record 3310 for corp5. As indicated above, corp5 is a competitor of the customer corporation corp1. Therefore, the example of FIG. 33 indicates that the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230X includes a record for each corporate entity of interest including the competitors of the customer corporation corp1.</p>
    <p>FIG. 36 illustrates an example corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233X. This table indicates that the corp1 group includes documents D1, D2, and D3. These are patent documents (see FIG. 17). The ownership<sub>--</sub> id attribute and the relevance<sub>--</sub> id attribute are defined in the example patent<sub>--</sub> ownership table 1234X in FIG. 35 and in the example relevance table 1235X in FIG. 34, respectively. Pursuant to these tables, document D1 is indicated as being owned by corp1 and being a core patent. Similarly, documents D2 and D3 are indicated as being owned by corp1 and being core patents.</p>
    <p>The methodology for initially loading the corporate entity databases 630 shall now be described with reference to the data flow diagrams in FIGS. 51 and 52 and the flowchart 10002 in FIG. 100. In step 10006, information on all corporate entities of interest is obtained. Such information includes compiling a list of the corporate entities of interest, determining their names, and determining their respective corporate structures. This information is represented in FIG. 51 as corporate entity data 5104.</p>
    <p>In step 10008, a corporate entity filter 5106 formats the corporate entity data 5104 to conform to the format of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230. Database filters for formatting data prior to upload to a database are well known.</p>
    <p>In step 10010, the formatted corporate entity data 5104 is loaded into a part of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 (this portion is indicated as the first part 5108 in FIG. 51). It is possible that the corporate entity data 5104 may include all the data necessary to load all of the fields of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity database 1230. In this case, the formatted corporate entity data 5104 is also loaded into the second part 5110 of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity database 1230. In other cases, however, the corporate entity data 5104 will not include all of the information necessary to load all of the fields of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230, such as the parent<sub>--</sub> corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute. In such cases, in step 10012, an operator 5112 analyzes the corporate entity data 5104 and determines values for the corp<sub>--</sub> level<sub>--</sub> id attribute and the parent<sub>--</sub> corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute, when necessary. This information is loaded into the remaining portion of the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 (this remaining portion is identified in FIG. 51 as the second part 5110).</p>
    <p>In step 10014, information on patents of interest which are not already represented in the patent bibliographic databases 604 is obtained. This information is loaded into the patent bibliographic databases 604 in the manner discussed above to the extent that it is not already represented in the patent bibliographic databases 604.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 52, this patent information that is of interest to the corporate entities represented in the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 is represented as patent information 5204.</p>
    <p>In step 10016, operators 5208 map patents to corporate entities. In particular, these operators 5208 determine which patents are relevant to which corporate entities. This data is stored in the corporate<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233. In other words, the operators 5208 determine which patents go into which corporate entity groups, and store this information in the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 233.</p>
    <p>In step 10018, the operators 5208 and 5214 run methodology reports, as needed, such as patent mapping reports. These reports will aid the operators 5208 and 5214 in performing the analysis of 10020.</p>
    <p>In step 10020, the operators 5208 and 5214 identify the ownership relationship for each patent/corporate entity pair specified in the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233. In other words, for each record in the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233, the operators 5208 and 5214 identify the ownership relationship between the corporate entity and the patent. Additionally in step 10020, the operators 5208 and 5214 identify, for each record of the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233, the relevance of the patent to the corporate entity. Relevance can be core, non-core, etc.</p>
    <p>In step 10022, this additional data generated in step 10020 is stored in the appropriate fields of the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233. These fields are presented by the second part 5212 in FIG. 52.</p>
    <p>The steps of flowchart 10002 are periodically performed to update the corporate entity databases 630 to reflect changes in corporate structure, corporate acquisitions, corporate acquisition of patents, product line changes (that may change the relevance<sub>--</sub> id attribute), patent expirations (that would change the ownership<sub>--</sub> id attribute), etc.</p>
    <p>Inventor, Employee, and Person Databases</p>
    <p>An inventor is a predefined group because any number of patents can be associated with the inventor (i.e., patents where the person has been named an inventor). The inventorship databases 628 of the present invention preferably include information on the customer's past and present employee inventors, inventors of other companies, such as competitors, and inventors of any other patents of interest to the customer.</p>
    <p>The inventor databases 628 are shown in FIG. 12J. These inventorship databases 628 interact with the person databases 632 and the employee 634. The person and employee databases 632 and 634 are shown in FIGS. 12J and 12L.</p>
    <p>In particular, the person table 1242 represents the person databases 632. The person table 1242 includes a record of each person of interest to the customer. These persons could be past and present employees of the customer, inventors of patents of interest to the customer, employees (past and present) of competitors, etc. Each record of the person table 1242 includes a person<sub>--</sub> id attribute that represents a unique key of the person. Also included in each record of the person<sub>--</sub> id table 1242 are attributes that store the first name, middle name, and last name of the person, and the preferred suffix (Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr., etc.) of the person.</p>
    <p>An employee table 1243 is a table in the employee databases 634. The employee table 1243 includes a record of each employee of interest (whether or not the employee is an employee of the customer or a competitor, or is a past or present employee). Each record of the employee database 1243 includes a person<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies the person (from the person table 1242), and a corporate<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies the corporate entity who is related to the person<sub>--</sub> id. There could be multiple entries in the employee table 1243 for the same person, if the person worked for many corporate entities represented in the databases 316.</p>
    <p>Each record of the employee table 1243 further includes a job<sub>--</sub> function<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies the job function of the employee (for example, engineer, attorney, computer programmer, etc.), an employee<sub>--</sub> type<sub>--</sub> id that identifies the type of employee (such as part-time, full-time, etc.), an employee<sub>--</sub> status<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies the status of the employee (active, inactive, etc.), a start<sub>--</sub> date attribute and an end<sub>--</sub> date attribute that identify the period that the employee was employed by the corporate entity, and an employee<sub>--</sub> id attribute that indicates the employee's identification number within the corporate entity. The job<sub>--</sub> function<sub>--</sub> id attribute, the employee<sub>--</sub> type<sub>--</sub> id, and the employee<sub>--</sub> status<sub>--</sub> id attribute are preferably implemented as codes whose values are defined in an employee<sub>--</sub> job<sub>--</sub> func table 1245, an employee<sub>--</sub> type table 1244, and an employee<sub>--</sub> status table 1246, respectively.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 12J, a validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236 represents the inventor databases 628. The validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236 stores information that identifies the patents to which a person is a named inventor. In particular, the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236 includes a record for each patent for which a person or employee is an inventor. Each record of the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236 includes a person<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies a person, and a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies a patent with which the person is a named inventor. Each record of the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236 also includes a corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies a corporate entity. This corporate entity is the corporate entity that the person was associated with when the patent was filed or issued, or the corporate entity with whom the person was employed when the invention of the patent was invented. If the person was not employed by or associated with a company, this field is left empty.</p>
    <p>The inventor databases 628, person databases 632, and employee databases 634 will now further be described with reference to the example shown in FIGS. 37-39. FIG. 37 illustrates an example person table 1242X. For simplicity purposes, only the person<sub>--</sub> id attribute is shown. As indicated by FIG. 37, there are five persons of interest to the customer.</p>
    <p>FIG. 38 illustrates an example employee table 1243X. For simplicity purposes, only the person<sub>--</sub> id attribute, the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id attribute, and the employee<sub>--</sub> status<sub>--</sub> id attribute are shown. As indicated by the example in FIG. 38, person1 is an active employee of corp1. Similarly, person2 is an active employee of corp2, person4 is an inactive employee corp1 and person5 is an inactive employee of corp3.</p>
    <p>FIG. 39 illustrates an example validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236X. For simplicity purposes, only the person<sub>--</sub> id attribute and the document<sub>--</sub> id attribute are shown in FIG. 39. As evident from FIG. 39, person1 is a named inventor in the patents having document<sub>--</sub> ids D1-D3. Person3 is a named inventor in the patents having document<sub>--</sub> ids D1, D4, and D5. Person5 is a named inventor in the patent having document<sub>--</sub> id D6.</p>
    <p>The preferred methodology for initially loading the person databases 632, the employee databases 634, and the inventor databases 628 shall now be described with reference to the data flow diagrams in FIGS. 49 and 50, and the flowcharts in FIGS. 98 and 99. FIGS. 49 and 98 corresponds to the extract and load procedures for the person databases 632 and the employee databases 634. In step 9806, information on the customer's past and present employees of interest are obtained, preferably from the customer's HR (Human Resources) or personnel department. This data is represented in FIG. 49 as the customer provided person and employee data 4904.</p>
    <p>In step 9808, information on other people of interest (such as inventors of patents of interest or employees of competitors) is obtained. Such information is represented in FIG. 49 as other person and employee data 4906.</p>
    <p>In step 9810, a person filter 4910 modifies the format of the customer provided person and employee data 4904 and the other person and employee data 4906 to match the format of the person databases 632 (that is, the person table 1242). Database filters for formatting data in preparation for database uploading are well-known.</p>
    <p>In step 9812, the formatted customer provided person and employee data 4904 and the formatted other person and employee data 4906 are loaded into the person databases 632 (that is, the person table 1242).</p>
    <p>In step 9814, an employee filter 4914 formats the customer provided person and employee data 4904 and the other person and employee data 4906 to match the format of the employee databases 634.</p>
    <p>In step 9816, the formatted customer provided person and employee data 4904 and the formatted other person and employee data 4906 are loaded into the employee databases 634.</p>
    <p>It is noted that in some cases, depending on the state of the data 4904, 4906, loading of the person databases 632 and the employee databases 634 may require the involvement of operators 4912, 4916.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 50 and 99 pertain to the loading of the inventor databases 628 (that is, the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor database 1236). In step 9906, information is obtained on the patents of interest to the customer. Such patents of interest include the customer's own patents and patents of competitors.</p>
    <p>In step 9908, bibliographic information on the patents obtained in step 9906 is loaded into the patent bibliographic databases 604 to the extent that such information is not already stored in the patent bibliographic databases 604.</p>
    <p>In step 9910, operators 5008 analyze the patent information 5004 in conjunction with the person databases 632 and the employee databases 634 to map the patents obtained in step 9906 to the persons represented in the person databases 632 and in the employee databases 634. In other words, in step 9910, the operators 5008 identify, for each person represented in the person databases 632 and in the employee databases 634, the patents where that person is a named inventor.</p>
    <p>In step 9912, the information generated in step 9910 is modified by a validated inventor filter 5006 to place the information in a form conforming with the format of the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236. Such formatted information is then loaded into the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236.</p>
    <p>The steps of flowcharts 9802 in FIG. 98 and 9902 in FIG. 99 are periodically repeated to update the inventor databases 628, the person databases 632, and the employee databases 634.</p>
    <p>Financial Databases</p>
    <p>Example financial databases 638 are shown in FIG. 12M. These example financial databases include a BOM financial table 1247 and a patent licensing table 1248. The BOM financial table 1247 includes financial information pertaining to BOM groups. Each record of the BOM financial table includes a BOM<sub>--</sub> id attribute which identifies the BOM group, and also includes attributes that specify the R&amp;D dollars that the customer spent to develop the assembly, subassembly, or part corresponding to the BOM group. Each record of the BOM financial table 1247 also includes attributes that specify the gross revenue generated by that assembly, subassembly, or part corresponding to the BOM group, and the net revenue generated by that assembly, subassembly, or part.</p>
    <p>The patent licensing table 1248 includes financial information pertaining to the licensing fees generated by patents of interest. Each record of the patent licensing table 1248 includes a document<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies a document (more specifically, that identifies a patent). Each record of the patent licensing table 1248 also includes attributes that identifies the licensee of the patent, the licensor of the patent, and the current licensing revenue generated by such licensing of the patent.</p>
    <p>It is noted that the financial tables 1247 and 1248 shown in FIG. 12M are only examples of the financial databases 638 supported and envisioned by the present invention. The invention is adapted and intended to include other financial tables directed to other financial information of interest to the customer. Accordingly, tables 1247, 1248 of FIG. 12M are provided for purposes of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>The financial databases 638 are generally loaded as described above with reference to FIGS. 45 and 95. The extract and load procedure represented in these FIGS. 45 and 95 may need to be modified to accommodate the particular financial information being processed. Such modifications will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the discussion herein.</p>
    <p>Security Databases</p>
    <p>The security databases 636 are shown in FIG. 12K. A user<sub>--</sub> table database 1238 includes a record for each user (that is, each person having rights to any of the data in the databases 316). Each record of the user<sub>--</sub> table database 1238 includes a user<sub>--</sub> id representing a key that uniquely identifies the user. Each record of the user<sub>--</sub> table 1238 also includes a user<sub>--</sub> name attribute that is an alternate key of the record, a user<sub>--</sub> full name attribute that stores the full name of the user, and a password attribute that stores the user's password.</p>
    <p>The present invention supports a multi-level security methodology. A first level of this security methodology specifies that the creator of a data item has full access privileges with respect to the data item. For example, consider the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 in FIG. 12I. Each record of the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 includes an owner<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> id attribute which identifies the creator (i.e., the owner) of the associated user-defined group. The owner<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> id attribute is implemented using codes whose values (user<sub>--</sub> id) are defined by the user<sub>--</sub> table database 1238 (FIG. 12K). Accordingly, the creator of a user-defined group as represented in a record of the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 has full access privileges with respect to that user-defined group.</p>
    <p>A second level of the invention's security methodology defines that a user may have specific access privileges with respect to an object, called a secured object. Such secured objects include, for example, a note, a document and its notes, a document, and a database. Such secured objects also include a user-defined group.</p>
    <p>This level of the security methodology as it relates to user-defined groups as secured objects is implemented using a group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237. It is noted that other types of secured objects can be implemented in a similar manner.</p>
    <p>Each record of the group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237 includes a group<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies a user-defined group, and a user<sub>--</sub> id attributed that defines a user. Each record of the group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237 also includes a permission attribute which defines the access privileges that the user has with respect to the group. Possible access privileges include no access privileges, a read access privilege, a change access privilege (which allows the user to both read and modify the data item), and a delete access privilege (that allows the user to read, modify, and delete the data item). Other access privileges could also be defined. Accordingly, a record in the group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237 specifies that a person (represented by user<sub>--</sub> id) has specific privileges (indicated by the permission attribute) to a particular user-defined group (represented by the group<sub>--</sub> id).</p>
    <p>A third level of the security methodology of the present invention specifies that a user group (such as a department) may have a particular access privilege with respect to a user-defined group. If a user is in that user group, then that user would also have that access privilege with respect to the user-defined group. This level of the security methodology is implemented using a grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> xref table 1240. Each record of this table 1240 includes a group<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies a user-defined group, and a user<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> id that identifies a user group. The user<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> id attribute is implemented as a code whose values are defined in a user<sub>--</sub> group table 1241. Each record of the grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> xref table 1240 also includes a permission attribute that defines the access privilege that the user group (specified by the user<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> id attribute) has with respect to the user-defined group (specified by the group<sub>--</sub> id attribute). Preferably, a user group permission is overridden by a user's explicit permission, allowing the system administrator to give a user a higher or lower permission than the user group that the user is in.</p>
    <p>A usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> xref table 1239 specifies the users who are in each user group. In particular, each record of this table 1239 includes a user<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies a user group, and a user<sub>--</sub> id attribute that identifies a user who is in that user group.</p>
    <p>The security databases 636 will now be further described with reference to an example in FIGS. 27-31. FIG. 27 illustrates an example user<sub>--</sub> table 1238X. As evident by FIG. 27, three users have access privileges with respect to the data in databases 316, Mike, Jen, and Kathryn. Referring again to FIG. 19, a group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227X is shown wherein user 1 (Mike) is indicated as being the owner of groups GRP1-GRP4. User 2 (Jen) is indicated as being the owner of group GRP5. User 3 (Kathryn) is indicated as being the owner of group GRP6. Accordingly, according to the security methodology of the present invention, user 1 (Mike) has complete access privileges (that is, the delete access privilege) with respect to groups GRP1-GRP4. User 2 (Jen) has delete access privileges with respect to group GRP5. User 3 (Kathryn) has delete access privileges with respect to group GRP6.</p>
    <p>FIG. 28 illustrates an example group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237X. This table indicates that user 2 has the change privilege with respect to user-defined group GRP1, and no privileges with respect to user-defined group GRP2.</p>
    <p>FIG. 31 illustrates an example grp<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> xref table 1240X. This table 1240X indicates that a user group with user<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> id UGRP2 has delete access privileges with respect to user-defined group GRP5. Similarly, a user group UGRP3 has no access privileges with respect to user-defined group GRP5, and user group UGRP3 has delete access privileges with respect to user-defined group GRP6. FIG. 29 illustrates an example user<sub>--</sub> group table 1241X.</p>
    <p>FIG. 30 illustrates an example usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> xref table 1239X. This table 1239X indicates that user 2 is in user group UGRP2, user 1 is in user group UGRP3, and user 3 is in user group UGRP4. Accordingly, considering both usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> xref table 1239X and grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> xref table 1240X, user 2 (Jen) has delete privileges with respect to GRP5, user 1 (Mike) has delete privileges with respect to user-defined group GRP6, and user 3 (Kathryn) has no privileges with respect to user-defined group GRP5.</p>
    <p>The various levels of the security methodology of the present invention do not work individually. Instead, these security methodology levels work together in a well defined and integrated manner. This integrated security methodology is implemented by the security module 402 in the enterprise server 314. The operation of the security module 402 when processing a request to access a data item (in particular, a user-defined group) is depicted in a flowchart 11002 in FIG. 110.</p>
    <p>The security module 402 performs the steps of flowchart 11002 to determine whether a user who is requesting an operation involving a data item has sufficient security access privileges with respect to that data item. Preferably, all operations performed by the enterprise server 314 are security checked. In other embodiments, only some operations performed by the enterprise server 314 are security checked. For example, operations involving reading patent documents are not security checked in some embodiments because patents are widely available public documents.</p>
    <p>The user requesting the operation involving the data item is called the requestor for reference purposes. For purposes of example, the data item that is involved in the operation is assumed to be a user-defined group having associated with it a record in the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 (FIG. 12I).</p>
    <p>In step 11006, the security module 402 determines whether or not the requester is the owner of the requested user-defined group. The security module 402 performs step 11006 by comparing the requestor's user<sub>--</sub> id with the owner<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> id attribute in the record of the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 corresponding to the requested user-defined group. If it is determined that the requester is the owner of the requested user-defined group, then the requestor is granted all access privileges (that is, the delete access privilege) with respect to the requested user-defined group. Processing of flowchart 11002 is then complete. If it is determined that the requestor is not the owner of the requested user-defined group, then step 11008 is performed.</p>
    <p>In step 11008, the security module 402 determines if the requestor has an explicit access right with respect to the requested user-defined group. The security module 402 performs step 11008 by referring to the group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237 (FIG. 12K). The security module 402 determines whether there is a record in the group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237 having group<sub>--</sub> id equal to the key of the requested user-defined group, and also having the user<sub>--</sub> id attribute equal to the user<sub>--</sub> id of the requestor. If such a record exists in the group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237, then the requester is given access to the requested user-defined group in accordance with the access right specified by the permission attribute in the record of the group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237. Processing of flowchart 11002 is then complete. If such a record does not exist in the group<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> xref table 1237, then step 11010 is performed.</p>
    <p>In step 1110, the security module 402 determines whether or not the requester is in a user group that has an explicit access right with respect to the requested user-defined group. The security module 402 performs step 11010 by accessing the usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> xref table 1239 to identify all groups that has the requestor as a member. The security module 402 then accesses the grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> xref table 1240 to determine whether any of the user groups in which the requester is a member has an explicit access right with respect to the requested user-defined group. This is done by identifying a record in the grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> xref table 1240 where the group<sub>--</sub> id attribute is equal to the identifier of the requested user-defined group, and the user<sub>--</sub> group<sub>--</sub> id attribute is equal to an identifier of a user group in which the requestor is a member. If such a record exists, then the requestor is given the explicit access right specified by the permission attribute in the record of the grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> xref table 1240.</p>
    <p>Processing of flowchart 11002 is then complete. If such a record does not exist in the grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> xref table 1240, then step 11012 is performed.</p>
    <p>In step 11012, the security module 402 accesses a record in the grp<sub>--</sub> usr<sub>--</sub> grp<sub>--</sub> xref table 1240 corresponding to a user group called World, if such a record is available. All users are considered to be a member of the user group World. The requester is then granted the access rights associated with the user group World (again, if such a World record is available). Referring to the example in FIG. 31, the World user group has the access right of read. Accordingly, in step 11012, the security module 402 grants the requestor the read access right with respect to the requested user-defined group. Processing of flowchart 11002 is incomplete. Note that, if a World record is not available, the requester is given no access rights.</p>
    <p>Some embodiments of the invention also include other levels of security. These levels can be in addition to, or in place of, one or more levels of security shown in FIG. 110. For example, the security module 402 before performing step 11006 may check to see if the requester has been explicitly revoked access to a particular portion of the database 316 that includes the data object. The requester may be revoked access to all of the data in the databases 316. As another example, the security module 402 before performing step 11006 may check to see if the requester is a super user, in which case the requester has complete access rights (i.e., the delete privilege) as to all data in the databases 316. These additional security levels can be implemented using tables in addition to the ones shown in FIG. 12K, or using modified variations of the tables shown in FIG. 12K. For example, additional fields can be added to the user<sub>--</sub> table 1238 that would indicate whether the user was a super user, or whether all access privileges for the user had been revoked as to a part of or all of the databases 316.</p>
    <p>In an embodiment of the invention, the security module 402 preferably processes these security levels in the following order (other orderings of the security levels could also be used):</p>
    <p>(1) Has the requester been revoked access? If not, then:</p>
    <p>(2) Is the requester a super user? If not, then:</p>
    <p>(3) Is the requester the owner of the data item? (step 11006) If not, then:</p>
    <p>(4) Does the requester have explicit rights as to the data item? (step 11008) If not, then:</p>
    <p>(5) Is the requester in a user group that has explicit rights as to the data item? (step 11010) If not, then:</p>
    <p>(6) If a World group exists, then use the access rights associated with the World group. Otherwise, the requester is granted no rights.</p>
    <p>It is noted that the security databases 636 shown in FIG. 12K and as described above apply only to the user-defined group databases 624. In other words, the security databases 636 only apply security measures as to the user-defined group databases 624. However, the invention is adapted and intended to extend the security of the security databases 636 and the security module 402 to all tables in the databases 316. The modifications necessary to the databases 316 and to the security module 402 to extend the security methodology of the present invention to all of the tables in the databases 316 will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s). For example, in order to extend the security methodology of the present invention to the BOM databases 626, it is only necessary to modify the BOM table 1217 to include an owner<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> id attribute. It would not be necessary to modify any of the security databases 636, as long as the group<sub>--</sub> id attribute could store identifiers of BOM groups.</p>
    <p>In order to extent the security methodology to the notes databases 640, it would only be necessary to modify the notes databases 640 to include an owner<sub>--</sub> user<sub>--</sub> id. No modifications to the security databases 636 would be necessary, as long as the group<sub>--</sub> id attribute in the security databases 636 could be overloaded to store the identifiers of notes. Alternatively, additional security tables could be added to the security databases 636.</p>
    <p>Only select persons have the ability to view and/or modify the data in the security databases 636. Such persons must have a high security level, and are typically system administrators. The client security module 702 provides a user interface at the clients 304, 306 that enable persons with sufficient security to view and/or modify the data in the security databases 636.</p>
    <p>Some security information may be obtained from the underlying operating system, such as user IDs and passwords, and perhaps even access privileges. This information is then loaded into the security databases 636.</p>
    <p>Enterprise Server and Client Functional Modules</p>
    <p>The analysis modules 416 in the enterprise server 314 and the corresponding client analysis module 716 in the clients 304, 306 are described in detail below. FIG. 10 illustrates a block diagram of the analysis modules 416 in the enterprise server 314. The analysis modules 416 in FIG. 10 are not intended to be an exhaustive list of analysis modules that the invention is adapted or intended to support. The invention, instead, can support any analysis modules capable of processing data in the databases 316 in a useful manner as judged by the customer. The scope of the invention is intended to include these modules.</p>
    <p>For the most part, the analysis modules 416 perform functions in a patent-centric and a group-oriented manner. In other words, the analysis modules 416 perform functions on patent related information, with or without consideration of other information. Also, the analysis modules 416 perform functions on documents in groups.</p>
    <p>Patent Mapping Module</p>
    <p>The patent mapping module 1002 operates to identify all patents that are mapped to a product. As discussed above, each product (assembly, subassembly, part) of interest to the customer is represented by a node in a BOM. Each BOM node is represented by a BOM group. Each BOM group is represented by a record in the BOM table 1217 (FIG. 12G). Accordingly, the patent mapping module 1002 operates to identify all patents within a BOM group. Such patents map to a product that is represented by the BOM group.</p>
    <p>The operation of the patent mapping module 1002 is represented by a flowchart 8402 in FIG. 84. In step 8406, the patent mapping module 1002 receives from the operator (working at a client 304, 306, called the requesting client 304, 306) information that identifies one or more BOM groups (for reference purposes, these are called the operator-specified BOM groups). In an embodiment of the invention, this information identifies one or more BOM group names. The patent mapping module 1002 matches these BOM group names to BOM<sub>--</sub> ids by searching in the BOM table 1217 for matches of the operator-provided BOM names to the name attribute.</p>
    <p>In step 8408, the patent mapping module 1002 identifies the patents contained in the BOM groups having the BOM<sub>--</sub> ids identified in step 8406. The patent mapping module 1002 performs step 8408 by searching in the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218 for records having BOM<sub>--</sub> id attributes equal to the BOM<sub>--</sub> ids identified in step 8406.</p>
    <p>In step 8410, the patent mapping module 1002 retrieves patent bibliographical information pertaining to the patents identified in step 8408. This is done by using the document<sub>--</sub> ids from the records of the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218 identified in step 8408 as indexes into the patent bibliographic databases 604. This patent bibliographic information is transferred to the requesting client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>In step 8412, the corresponding client analysis module 716 in the requesting client 304, 306 displays the received information. FIGS. 59 and 60 illustrate example display formats which the client analysis module 716 uses to display the patent data. In the display format 5902 of FIG. 59, the patent mapping data is sorted by BOM groups of logical level "subassembly". There are three BOM groups of logical level "subassembly" displayed in the example of FIG. 59, indicated by reference numbers 5904, 5906 and 5908. The BOM group of logical level "subassembly" having reference number 5904 is called "analog special effects controller subassembly". Each of its child BOM groups of logical level "part" are displayed under this title 5904. For each of these child BOM groups of logical level "part", the part description and part number (corresponding to data from the name attribute in the BOM table 1217) are displayed. Also displayed is the patent number of a patent that maps to the part (obtained from the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218), as well as the part status (obtained from the status<sub>--</sub> id attribute in the BOM table 1217), the ownership (obtained from the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233), and the relevancy status (obtained from the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233).</p>
    <p>The display format 6002 in FIG. 60 is similar to the display format 5902 in FIG. 59. Patent mapping data in the display format 6002 is also organized according to the BOM logical level "subassembly". Child BOM groups of logical level "part" are displayed below the respective titles of the BOM groups of logical level "subassembly".</p>
    <p>In some embodiments of the invention, the patent mapping module 1002 can also perform a document (as opposed to a patent) mapping function. This functionality is depicted in flowchart 8502 in FIG. 85. In step 8506, the patent mapping module 1002 receives from the operator (at the requesting client 304, 306) information that preferably identifies one or more group names. The patent mapping module 1002 matches these group names to group<sub>--</sub> ids by reference to the BOM table 1217.</p>
    <p>In step 8508, the patent mapping module 1002 identifies the documents that are in the groups corresponding to the group<sub>--</sub> ids identified in step 8506. The patent mapping module 1002 performs step 8508 by reference to the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218. These identified documents may include patents and non-patent documents.</p>
    <p>In step 8510, the patent mapping module 1002 extracts bibliographic information pertaining to the documents identified in step 8508 from the appropriate document bibliographic databases 602. This information is transferred to the requesting client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>In step 8512, the client analysis module 716 in the requesting client 304, 306 displays the information using display formats similar to that shown in FIGS. 59 and 60.</p>
    <p>Patent Citation Module</p>
    <p>The patent citation module 1004 operates to identify, for a particular patent (called the source patent), the patents which were cited during the prosecution of the selected patent (these patents are called citing patents). This is called a backwards citation report, because its focus is on looking backwards from the perspective of the source patent.</p>
    <p>The patent citation module 1004 also performs a forward citation function. In performing the forward patent citation function, the patent citation module 1004 identifies, for a source patent, the patents in which the source patent was cited. Again, these patents are called citing patents for reference purposes.</p>
    <p>A flowchart 8602 in FIG. 86 represents the operation of the patent citation module 1004 while performing the backward patent citation function.</p>
    <p>In step 8606, the patent citation module 1004 receives information from the operator (at a client 304, 306 called the requesting client 304, 306) that identifies one or more BOM groups. In an embodiment of the invention, the information provided by the operator identifies one or more group names corresponding to one or more BOM groups. The patent citation module 1004 identifies the BOM<sub>--</sub> ids for the BOM groups corresponding to the BOM group names by conducting a search through the BOM table 1217 using the BOM group names (provided by the operator) as an index.</p>
    <p>More generally, the patent citation module 1004 operates on any type of group, such as user-defined groups, inventor groups, corporate entity groups, etc. The operation of the patent citation module 1004 is discussed herein with reference to BOM groups for illustrative purposes only.</p>
    <p>In step 8608, the patent citation module 1004 identifies the patents which are mapped to the BOM groups corresponding to the BOM<sub>--</sub> ids identified in step 8606. The patent citation module 1004 performs step 8608 by searching in the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218 using the BOM<sub>--</sub> ids identified in step 8606 as indexes.</p>
    <p>In step 8610, the patent citation module 1004 identifies the patents (called the citing patents) that are cited in the patents identified in step 8608 by reference to the PatentRef table 1208 (FIG. 12C). The patent citation module 1004 performs step 8610 by processing each patent identified in step 8608 in turn. In particular, the patent citation module 1004 selects one of the patents identified in step 8608 and uses the document<sub>--</sub> id of the selected patent as an index into the PatentRef table 1208. As a result of this operation, the patent citation module 1004 will identify a record in the PatentRef table 1208 for each patent that was cited in the selected patent. The patent citation module 1004 performs this operation for each of the patents identified in step 8608.</p>
    <p>Also in step 8610, patent bibliographic information is retrieved from the patent bibliographic databases 604 for each of the citing patents.</p>
    <p>Also in step 8610, the patent citation module 1004 forwards the results of the above operations to the requesting client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>In step 8612, the client analysis module 716 in the requesting client 304, 306, displays the data received from the patent citation module 1004 to the operator. The client analysis module 716 displays this data in a format selected by the operator. FIGS. 61-65 depict example patent citation reporting formats. The operator can elect to view the patent citation information in any of these formats.</p>
    <p>For example, if the operator chooses to view the patent citation information organized by BOM group, then the display format illustrated in FIG. 61 and/or FIG. 63 is used. In the display format 6102 of FIG. 61, the patent citation data is sorted by BOM group. A portion of the patent citation data for a BOM group titled "digital video recording system" is shown in the example of FIG. 61. A table is displayed for each patent mapped to this BOM group. In the example of FIG. 61, such patents include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,327,235 and 5,359,428. These patents are called source patents, and they were identified in step 8608. Their patent numbers are displayed in the patent citation report in column 6106 of the tables. The titles of the source patents are displayed in column 6108 of the tables. The patents which are cited by the source patents are listed in column 6110 of the tables. These citing patents were identified in step 8610 of flowchart 8602. Bibliographic information on the citing patents is displayed in the remaining columns of the tables, such as the assignee information which is displayed in column 6112, title information which is displayed in 6114, and date information which is displayed in 6116. Other bibliographic information may be contained in the table and may be viewed by appropriate use of the navigation icons 6118.</p>
    <p>The display format 6302 in FIG. 63 is similar to the display format 6102 in FIG. 61. The patent citation data in the format 6302 is organized by BOM group. Listed below each BOM group are the patents which are mapped to that BOM group. These patents are listed by their patent numbers in column 6304, and are called source patents. The patents which are cited in these source patents (called citing patents) are listed by their patent number in column 6306. Bibliographic information on these citing patents are displayed in the following columns of the tables.</p>
    <p>Referring again to step 8612, if the operator elects to display the patent citation information sorted by selected patent characteristics, such as owned/license, then the display format 6402 in FIG. 64 is used. The display format 6402 includes a field 6404 which indicates whether owned or licensed patents are being displayed. If the operator elects to display only owned patents, then field 6404 would be modified to indicate this, and patent citation information on only patents owned by the customer (or any other corporate entity identified by the operator) would be displayed in the patent citation report using format 6402.</p>
    <p>Referring again to step 8612, if the operator elects to display the patent citation information in conjunction with ownership information, then display format 6202 in FIG. 62 is used. In display format 6202, the patent citation data is sorted by source patent number. For each source patent, the patents which cite the source patent (called citing patents) are displayed by patent number. Other patent bibliographic information on the citing patents is also displayed. In addition, ownership information (that is, whether or not the citing patent is owned, licensed, etc.) is also displayed in column 6204. This information was previously retrieved in step 8610 by the patent citation module 1004 by conducting a search of the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233 (FIG. 12J) using as indexes the document<sub>--</sub> ids of the citing patents (identified earlier in step 8610) and the corp<sub>--</sub> entity<sub>--</sub> id of a corporate entity specified by the operator. Accordingly, the ownership information displayed in column 6204 of display format 6202 can be relative to any operator-specified corporate entity, not just the customer corporate entity. The operator may have specified a corporate entity for purposes of data mining in the information received by the patent citation module 1004 in step 8606.</p>
    <p>Referring again to step 8612 in FIG. 86, the patent citation report can be performed and displayed in a recursive fashion with an operator specified depth. The display of such a recursive patent citation function is shown in FIG. 65. In the example of FIG. 65, patent 1 is the source patent, and patents 2-4 are cited in patent 1 (that is, patents 2-4 are citing patents with respect to source patent 1). The patent citation report of FIG. 65 is multi-leveled. Accordingly, the display format of FIG. 65 indicates that patents 5-8 are cited in patent 2, patent 9 is cited in patent 3, and patents 10-12 are cited in patent 4. The example format 6502 shown in FIG. 65 is a two level patent citation report. The present invention can support patent citation reports of any operator specified level. Other display formats could be used by the invention to more effectively display the results of multi-level patent citation reports, such as the well-known Xerox hyperbolic tree display format.</p>
    <p>The patent citation module 1004 collects data for a multi-level patent citation report by repetitively performing the steps of flowchart 8602, which will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts. The level of the report desired by the operator could be contained in the information that the patent citation module 1004 receives in step 8606.</p>
    <p>The forward patent citation function performed by the patent citation module 1004 is depicted in a flowchart 8702 shown in FIG. 87. In step 8706, the patent citation module 1004 receives information from the operator at the requesting client 304, 306 that identifies one or more BOM groups. In one embodiment, the information received from the operator identifies one or more BOM names that correspond to the one or more BOM groups. Also in step 8706, the patent citation module 1004 identifies the BOM<sub>--</sub> ids of the BOM groups by conducting a search in the BOM table 1217 using the BOM names as an index.</p>
    <p>In step 8708, the patent citation module 1004 identifies the patents which are mapped to the BOM groups associated with the BOM<sub>--</sub> ids identified in step 8706. The patent citation module 1004 performs step 8708 by conducting a search in the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218 using the BOM<sub>--</sub> ids identified in step 8706 as indexes.</p>
    <p>In step 8710, the patent citation module 1004 determines the patents that cite the patents identified in step 8708. The patent citation module 1004 performs step 8710 by conducting a search through the PatentRef table 1208 using the document<sub>--</sub> ids corresponding to the citing patents identified in step 8708 as indexes. The patent citation module 1004 forwards the results of the above operation to the client analysis module 716 in the requesting client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>In step 8712, the client analysis module 716 displays this information received from the patent citation module 1004 on the client display monitor 1122. The client analysis module 716 displays this information to the operator in any one of a number of display formats, examples of which are shown in FIGS. 61-65. These display formats are described above.</p>
    <p>Patent Aging Module</p>
    <p>The patent aging module 1006 operates to identify and analyze the remaining terms of patents that map to products, corporate entities, or inventors (that is, that are in BOM groups, corporate entity groups, or inventor groups that correspond to the products, corporate entities, or inventors). The patent aging module 1006 also operates to identify and analyze the remaining terms of patents that are in user-defined groups. The operation of the patent aging module 1006 is depicted in a flowchart 8802 shown in FIGS. 88A and 88B.</p>
    <p>In step 8806, the patent aging module 1006 receives from the operator at the requesting client 304, 306, information that identifies one or more groups. These can be user-defined groups or predefined groups, or any combination of such groups. In an embodiment of the invention, the patent aging module 1006 receives information from the operator that identifies group names that correspond to groups. The operator can identify such groups while located at the client 304, 306 by selecting one or more groups from the group hierarchy user interface (FIG. 58). This is true in all cases herein where the user identifies groups to the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>In some embodiments, the information may also have to identify the group types (i.e., BOM group, corporate entity group, inventor group, user-defined group, etc.). The patent aging module 1006 identifies the appropriate group IDs of these groups by reference to the appropriate group tables (that is, the BOM table 1217 for BOM groups, the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 for corporate entity groups, the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236 for inventor groups, the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227 for user-defined groups, etc.).</p>
    <p>In step 8808, the patent aging module 1006 identifies the patents which are contained in the groups corresponding to the group IDs identified in step 8806. The patent aging module 1006 performs step 8808 by searching through the appropriate patent xref tables, for example, the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218, the group<sub>--</sub> document<sub>--</sub> xref table 1228, the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233, the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236, etc.</p>
    <p>In step 8810, the patent aging module 1006 identifies the issue dates of the patents identified in step 8808 by reference to the patent table 1222 (FIG. 12H). The patent aging module 1006 does this by searching through the patent table 1222 using the document<sub>--</sub> ids identified in step 8808. In some embodiments, in step 8810, the patent aging module 1006 retrieves the expiration dates of the patents identified in step 8808 by reference to the calc<sub>--</sub> exp<sub>--</sub> date attribute in the patent table 1222.</p>
    <p>In step 8812, to the extent that the expiration dates of the identified patents were not loaded in the patent table 1222, the patent aging module 1006 calculates the expiration dates of the identified patents in accordance with the existing patent laws of the appropriate jurisdiction. The patent aging module 1006 does this by using the patent issue dates. The patent aging module 1006 then forwards the results of the above operation to the client analysis module 716 in the requesting client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>The client analysis module 716 then displays this information received from the patent aging module 1006 in an operator selected format. Such display of the patent aging information is described in the following steps.</p>
    <p>In step 8814, the client analysis module 716 determines whether the operator requested to display the patent aging information in a standard report format. If the operator wishes to display the patent aging information in a standard report format, then the client analysis module 716 uses the display formats shown in FIG. 66 and/or FIG. 67 to display the patent aging information.</p>
    <p>The display format 6602 of FIG. 66 is sorted by BOM group. The information for a BOM group titled "analog controller &amp; imaging system patents" is shown in the example of FIG. 66. The display format 6602 displays the remaining patent term for the patents that map to the BOM group in a bar graph format.</p>
    <p>The display format 6702 shown in FIG. 67 is similar to that of display format 6602 shown in FIG. 66.</p>
    <p>In step 8818, the client analysis module 716 determines whether the operator wishes to display the patent information in a standard format in conjunction with ownership information. If the operator elects to display the patent aging information in a standard report in conjunction with ownership information, then example display format 6902 shown in FIG. 69 is used. It is noted that, in order to utilize the display format 6902, the patent aging module 1006 must have previously have obtained ownership information on the patents identified in step 8808 from the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233, and forwarded this information to the requesting client 304, 306. Such an operation is represented by step 8820.</p>
    <p>The example display format 6902 shown in FIG. 69 is organized by ownership status relative to a corporate entity which the operator previously identified (this corporate entity could have been identified, for example, in the information received by the patent aging module 1006 in step 8806). Thus, the information shown in the display format 6902 can refer to patents owned and licensed by the customer or any other corporate entity, such as the customer's competitors.</p>
    <p>In step 8824, the patent aging module 1006 determines whether or not the operator wishes to view the patent aging information sorted by group. If the operator wishes to view the patent aging information sorted by group, then in step 8826 the patent aging information is displayed using an example format 6802 shown in FIG. 68. The display format 6802 displays patent expiration information sorted by group.</p>
    <p>In step 8828, the patent aging module 1006 determines whether the operator wishes to view the patent aging information sorted by organization level. If the operator wishes to view the patent aging information sorted by organization level, then the patent aging information is displayed in step 8834 using an example format 7002 shown in FIG. 70. It is noted that format 7002 can be used only if corporate<sub>--</sub> level<sub>--</sub> id information is obtained from the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230 for each patent identified in step 8808, and if this information is forwarded to the requesting client 304, 306. This operation is performed by the patent aging module 1006 in the enterprise server 314, and is represented by step 8830. Additionally, the display format 7002 also requires that ownership information be obtained from the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233 by the patent aging module 1006, and that this information be forwarded to the requesting client 304, 306. Such ownership information is obtained for each patent identified in step 8808 and for the corporate entity identified by the operator in the information preferably received by the patent aging module 1006 in step 8806. This operation is represented by step 8832.</p>
    <p>In the display format 7002 of FIG. 70, the patent aging information is sorted by organization level (that is, by the information from the corp<sub>--</sub> level<sub>--</sub> id attribute retrieved from the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230). Additionally, ownership information relative to the specified corporate entity is displayed along with remaining patent term information.</p>
    <p>In step 8836, the patent aging module 1006 determines whether the operator wishes to view the patent aging information organized by BOM level.</p>
    <p>If the operator wishes to view the patent aging information organized by BOM level, then the client analysis module 716 displays the patent aging information in a display format similar to that shown in FIG. 70, however instead of being sorted by organization level as currently shown in FIG. 70, the patent aging information is sorted by BOM level. It is noted that, in order to display the patent aging information in this manner, the BOM level<sub>--</sub> id information must be retrieved from the BOM table 1217 for each of the patents identified in step 8808, and ownership information for these identified patents and for the operator-specified corporate entity must be obtained from the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233. Such operation is performed by the patent aging module 1006 in the enterprise server 314, and is represented by steps 8838 and 8840.</p>
    <p>Patent Clustering and Bracketing Module</p>
    <p>The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 in the enterprise server 314 operates to identify and graphically represent potential relationships between a source patent and citing patents, where the citing patents are either cited in the source patent, or cite the source patent. Accordingly, the patent bracketing/clustering module performs a backwards operation, where it operates to identify potential relationships between a source patent and citing patents which were cited during the prosecution of the source patent. Additionally, the patent bracketing/clustering module 1008 also performs a forward function, where it attempts to identify potential relationships between a source patent and citing patents in which the source patent was cited.</p>
    <p>The operation of the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 when performing its backwards operation is represented by a flowchart 8902 in FIG. 89. In step 8906, the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 receives information identifying a patent number from an operator at the requesting client 304,306. The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 operates to identify the document<sub>--</sub> id of the patent having this patent number by using the patent number as an index in a search of the patent table 1222. This patent is called the source patent, for reference purposes.</p>
    <p>In step 8908, the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 identifies patents (called citing patents) that are cited by the source patent. The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 performs step 8908 by using the document<sub>--</sub> id identified in step 8906 as an index during a search of the PatentRef table 1208.</p>
    <p>In step 8910, the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 identifies the ownership of the source patent and ownership of the citing patents by reference to the assignee table 1201 and/or the core<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233. The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 forwards the results of the above operations to the client analysis module 716 in the requesting client 304,306.</p>
    <p>In step 8912, the client analysis module 716 displays the information received from the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 in the client display unit 1122. The client analysis module 716 displays this information using any one of a number of formats, such as the example formats shown in FIGS. 71-73.</p>
    <p>In an embodiment, the display format 7102 in FIG. 71 displays the patent bracketing/clustering information in a horizontal-oriented tree format (this is also called a connected graph format). An icon 7104 at the root of the tree represents the source patent. This icon is filled with a first pattern designated by reference number 7150 in key 7154. Icons 7106, 7108 and 7110 represent the citing patents.</p>
    <p>In the display format 7102, links 7148 are used to represent the relationship between the source patent (represented by icon 7104) and the citing patents (represented by icons 7106, 7108 and 7110). In particular, the links 7148 indicate that the citing patterns were cited during the prosecution of the source patent 7104.</p>
    <p>The icons 7106, 7108, 7110 corresponding to citing patents are filled with the same pattern 7150 of the icon 7104 corresponding to the source patent if the citing patents are owned by the same corporate entity as the source patent. In the example of FIG. 71, the icons 7106, 7108, 7110 corresponding to the citing patents are all filled with the first pattern 7150, which is the same that is used to fill the icon 7104 corresponding to the source patent. Accordingly, the example in FIG. 71 indicates that all of the patents (both the source patent and the citing patents) are owned by the same corporate entity.</p>
    <p>FIG. 71 illustrates a clustering scenario, because the corporate entity who owns the source patent and the citing patents has managed to cluster his patents in a given area of technology. Of course, this observation assumes that the source patent and the citing patents pertain to the same area of technology. However, this assumption is a reasonable one, given the relationship of the patents to one another (that is, given that the citing patents were cited during the prosecution of the source patent, and therefore can be presumed to be related to the source patent).</p>
    <p>The example display format 7202 shown in FIG. 72 illustrates a scenario where the source patent 7204 is not owned by the same corporate entity as the citing patents 7206,7208,7210 and 7212. The scenario in FIG. 72 represents a potential bracketing situation, because the corporate entity who owns the source patent has not managed to obtain additional patents in the area of technology of the source patent. Instead, other corporate entities have obtained patents (represented by icons 7206, 7208, 7210 and 7212) in this area of technology. The source patent is potentially surrounded or bracketed by the citing patents.</p>
    <p>The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 is capable of performing a multi-level, recursive patent bracketing/clustering function. The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 performs such a function by performing steps 8908 and 8910 for each of the citing patents. This operation by the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 can continue to any operator specified level of recursion. An example display format generated by the client analysis module 716 on the client display unit 1122 is shown in FIG. 73. The source patent is represented by icon 7304, and has two citing patents represented by icons 7306 and 7312. The patent corresponding to 7306 has itself two citing patents, represented by icons 7308 and 7310. The patent represented by 7312 has a citing patent represented by 7314, which itself has two citing patents represented by icons 7316 and 7318. The display in FIG. 73 represents a three-level patent bracketing/clustering scenario. This scenario in FIG. 73 also represents a hybrid clustering/bracketing situation. Note that the corporate entity who owns the root source patent (represented by icon 7304) also owns some of the citing patents in each level (that is, the patents represented by icons 7306, 7310, 7314 and 7316). However, there are some citing patents in the various levels which are not owned by this corporate entity.</p>
    <p>The operation of the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 when performing its forward operation is represented by a flowchart 9002 in FIG. 90. In step 9006, the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 receives information from the operator that identifies a patent number. The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 identifies the document<sub>--</sub> id that corresponds to a patent having this patent number by reference to the patent table 1222. This patent is called the source patent, for reference purposes.</p>
    <p>In step 9008, the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 identifies patents (called citing patents) in which the source patent is cited. The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 performs step 9008 by reference to the PatentRef table 1208.</p>
    <p>In step 9010, the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 identifies the ownership of the source patent and the citing patents by reference to the assignee table 1201 and/or the core<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233. The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 sends the information obtained by the above operation to the client analysis module 716 at the requesting client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>In step 9012, the client analysis module 716 displays this information on the client display unit 1122 using any of a number of display formats, such as the display formats shown in FIGS. 71-73. These display formats were described above.</p>
    <p>It is noted that the operation of the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008, in performing the backwards operation (FIG. 89) and/or the forwards operation (FIG. 90), can be done on a group basis, instead of the individual patent basis as described above. In performing this functionality on a group basis, the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 identifies all patents contained in the operator-specified group, and then identifies all citing patents of those patents in the operator-specified group. The client analysis module 716 displays the results of such group-oriented processing using any of a number of display formats, such as the formats shown in FIGS. 71-73, or in well-known formats suitable for displaying hierarchical data, such as the Xerox hyperbolic tree display format. It is noted that such display formats useful for displaying hierarchical structured data, such as the Xerox hyperbolic tree format, could also be used in the case of the individual patent operation represented by FIGS. 89 and 90.</p>
    <p>Financial Module</p>
    <p>The financial modules 1010 in the enterprise server 314 perform patent-centric and group-oriented processing of the data in the financial databases 638. Examples of the functions performed by the financial modules 1010 include determining the research and design (R&amp;D) expenditures on a product or product line basis, determining the R&amp;D expenditures per inventor or per employee on a product or product line basis, determining net licensing revenue on a product or product line basis, determining the number of patents issued on a product or product line basis, determining patent maintenance fees on a product or product line basis, determining market share on a product or product line basis, determining the tax rate on a product or product line basis, determining marketing costs on a product or product line basis, determining selling costs on a product or product line basis, determining the number of outstanding shares (P/E) on a product or product line basis, determining revenue on a product or product line basis, determining cumulative product revenue on a product or product line basis, etc. The financial modules 1010 can also perform the above processing on a geographical region basis, or on a time basis.</p>
    <p>Reference is made to the financial databases 1247 and 1248 shown in FIG. 12M for an example of the processing performed by the financial modules 1010. For example, the financial modules 1010 operate to determine the R&amp;D dollars on a product basis (more particularly, the R&amp;D dollars on a group basis, such as a BOM group basis). Given a operator-specified product (or an operator-specified group, such as a BOM group), the financial modules 1010 reference the BOM financial table 1247 using the associated BOM<sub>--</sub> id as a key to identify the record in the BOM financial table 1247 associated with the operator-specified BOM group. From that record, the financial modules 1010 can retrieve the values stored in the R&amp;D dollars attribute. This value represents the R&amp;D dollars spent in developing the product associated with the BOM group. The financial modules 1010 can also retrieve from that record the gross revenue and the net revenue generated by that product.</p>
    <p>As another example, the financial modules 1010 can determine the licensing revenue associated with any patent owned by the company. This is done by referencing the patent licensing table 1248 using the document<sub>--</sub> id of the operator-specified patent as an index to identify the record(s) in the patent licensing table 1248 corresponding to that operator-specified patent. Once the record is found, the financial modules 1010 can retrieve information on the licensee, licensor, and license revenue related to the license of the patent from the licensor to the licensee. It is noted that a given patent may have multiple entries in the patent licensing table 1248, corresponding to each licensor/licensee combination.</p>
    <p>The financial modules 1010 transfer the information generated from the above-described operation to the client analysis module 716 in the requesting client 304, 306. The client analysis module 716 displays this information on the client display unit 1122, and enables the operator to manipulate the information.</p>
    <p>Inventor Patent Count Module</p>
    <p>The inventor patent count module 1012 in the enterprise server 314 operates to analyze patent inventor information to identify the top inventors for an operator-specified group. Top inventors are defined herein as being persons who most frequently are named as inventors on the patents in the group. The operation of the inventor patent count module is represented in the flowchart 9102 and FIG. 91.</p>
    <p>In step 9106, the inventor patent count module 1012 receives from the operator at the requesting client 304, 306 information that identifies one or more groups. These can be any types of groups, such as BOM groups, corporate entity groups, operator-defined groups, etc. In an embodiment of the invention, the information received from the user identifies the group names of groups. These groups are called the operator-specified groups for reference purposes. In some embodiments, this information may also identify the types of the groups (i.e., BOM group, corporate entity group, user-defined group, etc.).</p>
    <p>The inventor patent count module 1012 identifies the group IDs of the operator-specified groups by using the group names as indexes in searches of the appropriate group table (that is, the BOM table 1217, the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227, and the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230).</p>
    <p>In step 9108, the inventor patent count module 1012 identifies patents that are contained in the operator-specified groups. The inventor patent count module 1012 performs step 9108 by accessing the appropriate cross-reference tables using the group keys (identified in step 9106) as indexes. Such cross-reference tables include the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218, the group<sub>--</sub> document<sub>--</sub> xref table 1228, and the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233.</p>
    <p>In step 9110, the inventor patent count module 1012 identifies the inventors of the patents identified in step 9108 by reference to the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236. The inventor patent count module 1012 accesses the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236 using the document<sub>--</sub> ids of the patents identified in step 9108 as indexes. The inventor patent count module 1012 processes the patent and inventorship information obtained as described above to determine, for each person, the number of patents (in the operator-specified group) in which the person is named as an inventor.</p>
    <p>In step 9112, the inventor patent count module 1012 extracts additional pertinent information from the databases 316, such as each person's employment status from the employee table 1243, the relevance of the identified patents from the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233, and the corporate levels of the corporate entities that own the identified patents from the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230. The inventor patent count module 1012 forwards the information resulting from the above operation to the client analysis module 716 in the requesting client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>In step 9114, the client analysis module 716 displays this data to the operator on the client display unit 1122. The client analysis module 716 displays the inventor patent count information in any of a number of display formats, such as display formats shown in FIGS. 74-77.</p>
    <p>The sample displays in FIGS. 74 and 75 are similar, wherein the inventor patent count information is displayed in a bar graph format.</p>
    <p>The display format 7602 in FIG. 76 displays the inventor patent count information in more of a spreadsheet or tabular format. This table lists, for a given group, the persons who are named as inventors of patents. Also listed are the number of patents in which each person is listed as inventor, as well as other information such as each person's employment status. Also listed in the display format 7602 of FIG. 76 is, for each person, the number of core patents and the number of non-core patents in which the person is named as an inventor.</p>
    <p>The example display format 7702 in FIG. 77 is also a spreadsheet or tabular format sorted by organization level. The information contained in the format 7702 of FIG. 77 is similar to the information contained in the display format 7602 of FIG. 76.</p>
    <p>Inventor Employment Information Module</p>
    <p>The inventor employment information module 1014 in the enterprise server 314 operates to obtain information on persons who are named as inventors in patents that map to operator-specified groups. The operation of the inventor employment information module 1014 is represented by a flowchart 9202 in FIG. 92.</p>
    <p>In step 9206, the inventor employment information module 1014 receives information from the operator at the requesting client 304, 306. This information identifies one or more groups, called operator-specified groups for reference purposes. Such groups may be BOM groups, user-defined groups, corporate entity groups, etc. In an embodiment of the invention, the information received from the operator identifies one or more group names that correspond to the operator-specified groups. The inventor employment information module 1014 identifies the group IDs of the operator-specified groups by reference to the appropriate group tables, such as the BOM table 1217, the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230, the group<sub>--</sub> table database 1227, etc. The inventor employment information module 1014 accesses these group tables using the group names as indexes.</p>
    <p>In step 9208, the inventor employment information module 1014 identifies the patents which are contained in these operator-specified groups. These patents are called the identified patents for reference purposes.</p>
    <p>The inventor employment information module 1014 performs step 9208 by accessing the appropriate cross-reference tables using the group IDs identified in step 9206. These cross-reference tables include the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218, the group<sub>--</sub> document<sub>--</sub> xref table 1228, the corp<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1233, etc.</p>
    <p>In step 9210, the inventor employment information module 1014 identifies the inventors of the identified patents (identified in step 9208) by reference to the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236. The inventor employment information module 1014 accesses the validated<sub>--</sub> inventor table 1236 using the document IDs for the identified patents identified in step 9208.</p>
    <p>In step 9212, the inventor employment information module 1014 extracts from the databases 316 information about the inventors. Such information is extracted by the inventor employment information module 1014 from the person table 1242 and the employee table 1243.</p>
    <p>In step 9214, the inventor employment information module 1014 extracts other information for display in reports, such as the names of the corporate entities who own or license the identified patents. Such information is retrieved from at least the corporate<sub>--</sub> entity table 1230. The inventor employment information module 1014 transfers the information obtained from the above processing to the client analysis module 716 at the requesting client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>In step 9216, the client analysis module 716 displays this information on the client display unit 1122 in a variety of operator-selected display formats, such as the example display formats shown in FIGS. 78-80.</p>
    <p>The display format 7802 in FIG. 78 sorts the inventorship data by group. Information pertaining to the patents that map to a particular group is displayed in tabular format. The display format 7902 in FIG. 79 is similar to the display format 7802 in FIG. 78.</p>
    <p>The display format 8002 in FIG. 80 organizes data according to the corporate entity that owns the identified patent. Information pertaining to the patents owned by each corporate entity is presented in a tabular format.</p>
    <p>Exporting Patent Data Module</p>
    <p>The exporting patent data module 1018 in the enterprise server 314 operates to copy data from the databases 316 to an operator-specified location. For example, the exporting patent data module 1018, pursuant to operator command, can export a subset of the patent database 614 to an operator-specified location. The operator could then utilize this data locally, separate from the enterprise server 314. Operation of the exporting patent data module 1018 is represented by flowchart 9402 in FIG. 94.</p>
    <p>In step 9406, the client analysis module 716 in the client 304, 306 enables the operator to select which of the patents in the patent database 614 to export. The operator can select such patents by group, or individually, or both by group and individually. The client analysis module 716 transfers this operator request to the exporting patent data module 1018 in the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>In step 9408, the exporting patent data module 1018 causes the document storage and retrieval module 408 to retrieve information from the patent database 614 corresponding to the patents selected by the operator in step 9406. The enterprise server 314 transmits this information to the client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>In step 9410, the client analysis module 716 copies the information retrieved from the enterprise server 314 to a operator-specified location.</p>
    <p>Importing Patent Data Module</p>
    <p>As discussed above, the exporting patent data module 1018 operates to copy a portion of the customer's patent repository (stored in the patent database 614) to a operator-specified location. The operator can then work locally with this patent information. Eventually, the operator may want to update the databases 316 in the enterprise server 314 with any updates made to this subset of the patent database 614.</p>
    <p>The importing patent data module 1016 in the enterprise server 314 operates to perform this functionality. In particular, the importing patent data module 1016 imports to the databases 316 data that a operator has been working with locally, separate from the enterprise server 314. The operation of the importing patent data module 1016 is represented by a flowchart 9302 in FIG. 93.</p>
    <p>In step 9306, the client analysis module 716 in the client 304, 306 accesses patent information stored in an operator-specified location 9306 which is local to the client 304, 306. The client 304, 306 transfers this patent information to the enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>In step 9308, the importing patent data module 1016 receives this information from the client 304, 306 and loads the patent information into the databases 316, including the patent database 614 and the patent bibliographic databases 604.</p>

    <p>The tasks listed above, and other tasks that would be useful to the business customer, can be performed by invoking the analysis modules 416, either individually or in combination. For example, some of the tasks mentioned above can be performed by invoking the patent mapping module 1002 alone. Others of the tasks listed above require, for example, the invocation of the patent mapping module 1002 in combination with one or more of the other analysis modules 416, such as the patent citation module 1004 or the patent aging module 1006.</p>
    <p>The performance of some of the tasks mentioned above involve human intervention. Specifically, with some of the tasks, one or more of the analysis modules 416 are invoked. These analysis modules 416 automatically process data in the databases 316, and automatically prepare reports (generally called methodology reports) based on such processing. One or more human operators then analyze the reports to complete the tasks. The invention supports and assists the human operators in performing their functions by automatically analyzing data and running reports.</p>
    <p>In some embodiments, the invention includes expert system(s) 1020 to automatically analyze and process the data in the reports that were automatically generated by the analysis modules 416. It is noted that the expert system 1020 is shown as being a part of the analysis modules 416 in FIG. 10, but may in practice be a separate component of the enterprise server 314, or may form part of the client 304, 306.</p>
    <p>In these embodiments, the expert system 1020 either aids the human operators in performing the above-listed tasks, or completely replaces the human operators in analyzing the data that was automatically generated by the analysis modules 416. Such expert systems 1020 could be trained (using well known procedures) with the knowledge and experience of the human operators. The structure and operation of expert and rule based systems, and the training of such systems, are well known and are described in a number of publicly available documents, including (but not limited to) Charniak et al., Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Addison Wesley, 1986, and Nils J. Nilsson, Principles of Artificial Intelligence, Morgan Kaufmann, Los Altos, Calif., 1980, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. The manner in which to construct and train expert systems to automatically perform a part of or all of the processing described herein as being performed by human operators will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s).</p>
    <p>Various patent-centric and group-oriented methodologies of the present invention are described below. These methodologies represent tasks that can be performed (either with or without human involvement) through use of the invention. These methodologies essentially involve two steps. In the first step, one or more analysis modules 416 are invoked for the purpose of automatically accessing and processing data contained in the databases 316, and for the purpose of automatically reporting on such processing (such reports are generally called methodology reports). In the second step, the reports generated by the analysis modules 416 are analyzed, and business-related actions, plans, and/or strategies are taken or developed based on the analysis. This second step may be performed by human operators, or may be automatically performed by expert systems (as described above), or may be performed by a combination of human operators and expert systems. In the following description of the methodologies, the second step is described as being performed by human operators. It should be understood, however, that the second step could alternatively be performed by expert systems, or by expert systems in combination with human operators.</p>
    <p>The methodologies described below represent a sampling of the tasks that can be performed through use of the invention. The invention is adapted and intended to perform other patent-centric and group-oriented tasks, particularly tasks that can be implemented through mining and/or processing of the data in the databases 316. Accordingly, the following methodologies are described herein for purposes of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>Patent Mapping and Mining</p>
    <p>A corporate entity can utilize the present invention in order to perform a patent mapping and mining process. This process is an internally focused analysis where the impact of the corporate entity's patents (both owned and licensed) on the corporate entity is analyzed. The business impact of this process is to provide high financial leverage within the corporate entity. The patent mapping and mining process provides a tangible way of defining core (active) and non-core (non-active) patents and how they relate to the corporate entity's business. Short term financial results of the patent mapping and mining process can be found in licensing opportunities and non-renewal of inactive patents and licensed patents.</p>
    <p>It is noted that the customer may, based on its own practices or needs, define the meaning of core and non-core. For example, core could correspond to patents being used by the customer, and non-core could correspond to patents not being used by the customer. Accordingly, the definition of core and non-core is implementation dependent.</p>
    <p>A flowchart 10202 in FIG. 102 illustrates an example patent mapping and mining process. In FIG. 10206, an operator (that is, an employee or agent of the customer corporate entity) at a client 304, 306 issues a command that causes the patent mapping module 1002 to run a patent mapping report with respect to a product specified by the operator. The patent mapping module 1002 runs a patent mapping report on the BOM group corresponding to the operator-specified product in the manner discussed above. Example patent mapping reports are shown in FIGS. 59 and 60.</p>
    <p>In step 10208, the operator identifies from the patent mapping reports the core and non-core patents that map to the BOM group corresponding to the operator-specified product. For example, in the example display of FIG. 59, if the operator specified product is the analog special effects controller subassembly 5904, then the operator would be able to determine from the patent mapping report that U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,719,523; 4,686,590; 4,716,476 and 5,029,013 were non-core patents. In contrast, if the operator specified group was the digital color correction subassembly 5906, then the operator could identify from the patent mapping report that U.S. Pat. Nos. that 5,381,175; 5,452,018; and 5,353,059 were core patents.</p>
    <p>In step 10210, the operator considers various business options with respect to the non-core patents. In particular, the operator considers whether the non-core patents should be licensed or sold. This determination may be based on whether the corporate entity is contemplating the introduction of future products having features that would be covered by the non-core patents.</p>
    <p>The operator may also consider whether or not the non-core patents should be held in reserve as a shield against a possible allegation of infringement by a competitor. This issue may depend on whether the non-core patents cover technology which is used by competitors. The operator can run patent citation reports (performed by the patent citation module 1004) and/or patent clustering/bracketing reports (performed by the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008) to determine whether it appears that its competitors are active in the areas of technology covered by the non-core patents.</p>
    <p>The operator could also consider whether patent maintenance fees should be paid on the non-core patents. This issue, like those discussed above, may depend on whether the corporate entity intends to use the technology covered by the non-core patents in future products, or whether or not the corporate entity's competitors are currently using the technology covered by the non-core patents. A decision to discontinue payment of maintenance fees on the non-core patents would result in an immediate monetary savings for the corporate entity.</p>
    <p>Also, the operator could consider whether or not the corporate entity should continue to license the non-core patents. The issues involved with this determination are similar to those discussed above. If the corporate entity decides to discontinue the license of the non-core patents, then the corporate entity could realize an immediate cost savings.</p>
    <p>Further, the operator could consider whether the technology covered by the non-core patents could be used in the development of new features or products for the corporate entity.</p>
    <p>In the above, step 10210 is described as being performed by a single operator. In practice, the performance of step 10210 may require the involvement of many people with knowledge in many different fields and having different abilities (or expert systems with this knowledge and abilities).</p>
    <p>The patent mapping and mining process as represented in flowchart 10202 is an iterative process, as represented by control arrow 10212. In other words, the patent mapping and mining process represented in flowchart 10202 could be performed repeatedly over time for the same product, or could be performed a number of times, each time for a different product.</p>
    <p>Situation Assessment</p>
    <p>A corporate entity could use the present invention to perform a situation assessment process. A situation assessment process focuses on the corporate entity's current business situation. The situation assessment process determines the strategic "playing field" of the corporate entity's business as it relates to its patents and products. By performing a situation assessment process or analysis, the corporate entity can begin to analyze its current market in the competitive situation in relation to its products and patents. The situation assessment analysis begins by running a number of methodology reports in order to better understand the corporate entity's competitive situation. These methodology reports provide a clear understanding of a number of patent related business metrics, including:</p>
    <p>potential patent infringement;</p>
    <p>the length of protection on core product patents based on patent aging reports;</p>
    <p>how well the corporate entity's patents are clustered to protect current and future products and key features;</p>
    <p>determination of whether competitors are bracketing the company's current and future products through their patents;</p>
    <p>determination of whether key technologists who have developed the current core products are still in the company or have gone to competitors;</p>
    <p>a determination of whether key inventors and other R&amp;D personnel are working on appropriate products based on the corporate entity's strategic direction; and</p>
    <p>a determination of whether any R&amp;D resources should be reallocated for best use of human resources.</p>
    <p>Based on the above patent related business metrics, the corporate entity can determine what strategic steps need to be implemented in relation to: merger and acquisitions, human resources (HR) retention programs, patent licensing programs, patent acquisition programs, product or division sale, appropriate tax strategies, etc.</p>
    <p>A flowchart 10302 in FIG. 103 illustrates an example situation assessment process.</p>
    <p>In step 10306, a competitive analysis process is performed to identify and analyze the positions of the corporate entity's competitors. In performing the competitive analysis process, the corporate entity examines the competitor's products per product line, examines competitor's patents via aging reports, profiles competitor's inventors, and determines whether competitors are potentially infringing the corporate entity's patents. Details of the competitive analysis process is described below.</p>
    <p>In step 10308, patent clustering and bracketing are evaluated. In performing this evaluation, the corporate entity runs clustering and bracketing reports for future product protection, determines if product features have been adequately protected, determines if the corporate entity's present and future core technologies have been adequately protected by patents, etc. Details of the clustering and bracketing process are described below.</p>
    <p>In step 10310, an inventor analysis is performed. In performing this inventor analysis, the corporate entity analyzes inventorship with respect to patents covering its core technology, analyzes competitor's inventors, determines whether it should consider hiring the inventors of its competitors, determines whether its own employee retention program should be modified in any way, etc. Details of the inventor analysis are described below.</p>
    <p>In step 10312, the corporate entity performs a financial analysis process using the present invention. In performing this financial analysis, the corporate entity evaluates a number of patent-centric and group-oriented business metrics, such as the R&amp;D expenditures per product, the R&amp;D expenditures per inventor for a product line, the net licensing revenue per product line, the patent budget for a product line, the patent maintenance fees associated with a product line, the market share of a product line, the tax rate of a product line, marketing costs of a product line, selling costs of a product line, allocated costs of a product line, product revenue over product costs, etc. Details of this financial analysis process are described below.</p>
    <p>The situation assessment process is an iterative one, as represented by control arrow 10314 in the flowchart 10302. The steps of flowchart 10302 can be performed repeatedly, and in any order. Thus, the steps in FIG. 103 are provided for purposes of illustration, not limitation.</p>
    <p>Competitive Analysis</p>
    <p>FIG. 104 is a flowchart 10402 representing the operation of the competitive analysis process.</p>
    <p>In step 10406, an operator associated with the corporate entity (such as an employee or consultant of the corporate entity) located at a client 304, 306 issues a command to the patent citation module 1004 to run a patent citation report on the patents in a group specified by the operator. The operator may request that either a backwards and/or a forwards patent citation report be formed. The manner in which the patent citation module 1004 performs the patent citation process is described above. Examples of patent citation reports are shown in FIGS. 61-65.</p>
    <p>In step 10408, the operator, by reference to the patent citation report, identifies the companies who are the current assignees of the citing patents. These companies may be potentially working in the same technological areas as the source patents since their patents either cited the source patents (in the case of forwards patent citation reports), or they were cited in the source patents (in the case of backwards patent citation reports). Accordingly, the assignees of the citing patents may potentially be competitors of the customer corporate entity (assuming, of course, that the assignees of the citing patents are not the same as the customer corporate entity). Accordingly, in step 10408, the operator, through analysis of the patent citation report, is able to identify potential competitors of the customer client entity with respect to the technological area of the operator-specified group. It is noted that these potential competitors may be infringing the corporate entity's patents (that is, the source patents). These potential competitors may also be interested in licensing the corporate entity's patents (the source patents). Further, the customer corporate entity may be interested in licensing or purchasing the patents listed as citing patents in the patent citation report.</p>
    <p>In step 10410, the operator further analyzes the patent citation report to determine the potential strength of the competitors' positions in the technological areas relative to the source patents. For example, if a large number of the citing patents are assigned to a given competitor company, then that may indicate that the competitor company has a strong patent position with respect to the technological area of the associated source patent. An operator may conclude from this that the customer corporate entity should consider reducing its product line or even discontinuing the product line given the potential strengths of the competitor's patents in the area. Other options would be to sell the product line to the potential competitor, or modify the product line to avoid any potential patent infringement by the customer client entity of the competitor's patents.</p>
    <p>In step 10412, the operator reviews the patent citation report to identify a competitor's potential future product direction. The operator performs step 10412 by noting the number of patents that a potential competitor has in an area, and also noting the filing and issue dates of those patents. This information may indicate the extent to which a potential competitor is interested in a technological area. For example, if a potential competitor has a large number of patents in an area, and those patents were filed or issued relatively recently, then that may be an indication that the potential competitor is preparing to move into or expand its presence in the area.</p>
    <p>In step 10414, the operator issues a command that causes the patent aging module 1006 to run an aging report. The patent aging reports are run with respect to the citing patents (that is, the patents which are owned by potential competitors). The manner in which the patent aging module 1006 performs the patent aging function is described above. Examples of patent aging reports are shown in FIGS. 66-70. The operator analyzes the patent aging report in view of issues including whether or not to license competitor patents, purchase competitor patents, design around competitor patents, ignore competitor patents, etc. These decisions are impacted by the remaining terms of the competitor patents. For example, if a potentially relevant competitor patent has a long patent term remaining, then the customer corporate entity may be more inclined to license or purchase the patent. In contrast, if the patent has a short term remaining, then the customer corporate entity may be more inclined to ignore the patent or design around the patent.</p>
    <p>In step 10416, the operator issues commands that cause the inventor patent count module 1012 and the inventor employment information module 1014 to run inventorship reports on the patents owned by the potential competitors. The manner in which the inventor patent count module 1012 and the inventor employment information module 1014 operate to run these inventorship reports are described above. Examples of inventor patent count reports are shown in FIGS. 74-77. Examples of inventor employment information reports are shown in FIGS. 78-80.</p>
    <p>In step 10418, the operator analyzes inventor patent count reports to identify the top inventors of patents covering key technology. The operator analyzes the inventor employment information reports to determine if these key inventors are still with the competitors. If they are not, then the operator can consider whether the corporate entity should consider hiring the inventors. Also from the inventor employment information reports, the operator can determine if the top inventors were former employees of the customer corporate entity. If they were, then the operator can set in motion processes to insure that these inventors are complying with their former employment agreements with the customer corporate entity. Further from the inventor employment information reports, the operator can determine if the top inventors are still employed by the competitors. If they are, the operator can consider whether the corporate entity should consider hiring these top inventors.</p>
    <p>The competitive analysis process is an iterative one, as indicated by control arrow 10420. The steps of flowchart 10402 can be performed repeatedly, and in any order. Therefore, the steps of flowchart 10402 are provided in FIG. 104 for purposes of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>The above operation is described as being performed by a single operator. In practice, the above operation may require the involvement of many people with knowledge in many different fields and having different abilities (or expert systems with this knowledge and abilities).</p>
    <p>Clustering and/or Bracketing</p>
    <p>The clustering and/or bracketing process is illustrated in a flowchart 10502 in FIG. 105. In step 10506, an operator associated with the customer corporate entity at a client 304, 306 issues commands to run patent clustering/bracketing reports for a particular product, called the operator specified product for reference purposes. This product corresponds to a BOM group. The patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 in the enterprise server 314 runs these patent clustering/bracketing reports for the operator specified BOM group. The operation of the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 is described above. Examples of patent clustering/bracketing reports are shown in FIGS. 89 and 90.</p>
    <p>In step 10508, the operator studies the patent clustering/bracketing reports to determine whether the customer client entity's product has been adequately protected by the customer corporate entity's patents. In other words, the operator reviews the clustering/bracketing report to determine whether or not clustering exists. An example of clustering is shown in FIG. 71.</p>
    <p>In step 10510, the operator reviews the patent clustering/bracketing reports to determine the extent to which others have patented the technology related to the patents in the BOM group associated with the operator-specified product. In other words, the operator in step 10510 analyzes the patent clustering/bracketing reports to determine whether full or partial bracketing exists. An example of full bracketing is shown in FIG. 72. An example of partial bracketing is shown in FIG. 73.</p>
    <p>Based on the above analysis, the operator evaluates whether these patents owned by others should be licensed, purchased, ignored, designed around, etc. To assist in performing this evaluation, the operator may run patent aging reports and/or inventorship reports on these patents owned by others. These reports will aid the operator in conducting the evaluation.</p>
    <p>The clustering and/or bracketing process is an iterative one, as represented by control flow arrow 10512. The steps of the clustering and/or bracketing flowchart 10502 can be performed repeatedly for the same or different BOM groups, and can be performed in any order. Accordingly, the steps of the clustering and/or bracketing flowchart 10502 are presented in FIG. 105 for purposes of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>The above operation is described as being performed by a single operator. In practice, the above operation may require the involvement of many people with knowledge in many different fields and having different abilities (or expert systems with this knowledge and abilities).</p>
    <p>Inventor Analysis</p>
    <p>The inventor analysis process is illustrated in the flowchart 10602 shown in FIG. 106. In step 10606, an operator associated with the customer client entity located at a client 304, 306 issues commands to run inventorship reports for a product, called an operator specified product for reference purposes. The product corresponds to a BOM group. For references purposes, the BOM group is called the operator specified BOM group (because it corresponds to the operator specified product). The inventor patent count module 1012 and the inventor employment information module 1014 in the enterprise server 314 perform these inventorship report functions. In particular, the inventor patent count module 1012 performs the inventor patent count function, and the inventor employment information module 1014 performs the inventor employment information function. The operation of the inventor patent count module 1012 and the inventor employment information 1014 is described above. Examples of inventor patent count reports are shown in FIGS. 74-77. Examples of inventor employment information reports are shown in FIGS. 78-80.</p>
    <p>In step 10608, the operator identifies key or top inventors of the customer corporate entity's patents based on the inventorship reports.</p>
    <p>In step 10610, the operator refers to the inventor employment information reports to identify whether these key inventors are still employed by the customer corporate entity. If they are still employed by the customer corporate entity, then the operator can initiate steps to ensure that the customer corporate entity retains them. If they are not still employed by the customer corporate entity, then the operator can initiate steps to ensure that these former employees are in compliance with their employment agreement with the customer corporate entity. Also, the operator can consider whether the customer corporate entity should consider rehiring them.</p>
    <p>In step 10612, if the key inventors are still employed by the customer corporate entity, then the operator refers to the inventor employment information reports to determine whether the talents of these inventors are being most effectively utilized by the corporate entity. For example, if the inventors are no longer assigned to the department that developed the operator specified product, then the corporate entity may want to transfer them back to that department so that they can further enhance the product.</p>
    <p>The inventor analysis process is an iterative one, as represented by control flow arrow 10614. The steps of the inventor analysis flowchart 10602 can be performed repeatedly or in any order for any given BOM group. Accordingly, the steps in the inventor analysis flowchart 10602 are provided for purposes of illustration, not limitation.</p>
    <p>The above operation is described as being performed by a single operator. In practice, the above operation may require the involvement of many people with knowledge in many different fields and having different abilities (or expert systems with this knowledge and abilities).</p>
    <p>Financial Analysis</p>
    <p>The financial analysis process is represented by a flowchart 10702 in FIG. 107.</p>
    <p>In step 10706, an operator associated with the customer corporate entity at a client 304, 306 issues instructions to the financial modules 1010 in the enterprise server 314. These instructions command the financial modules 1010 to calculate the research and development dollars per patent in a BOM group. The BOM group is specified by the operator.</p>
    <p>The financial modules 1010 perform this function by first determining the number of customer patents that map to the BOM group (by reference to the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218). Next, the financial modules 1010 determine the R&amp;D dollars for a project (by reference to the BOM financial table 1247). Then, the financial modules 1010 divide the R&amp;D dollars by the number of patents.</p>
    <p>In step 10710, the financial modules 1010 calculate the licensing dollars resulting from a project by identifying the customer patents that map to the product (by reference to the BOM<sub>--</sub> patent<sub>--</sub> xref table 1218), and determining the licensing revenue generated by those patents (by reference to the patent licensing table 1248).</p>
    <p>Operators analyze the data obtained from the above processing to evaluate the customer's business from a patent/financial point of view.</p>
    <p>It is noted that the steps of flowchart 10702 are provided for purposes of illustration, and not limitation. Additional steps directed to other financial operations that process the data in databases 316 can be added to the flowchart 10702. Additionally, the financial analysis process of FIG. 107 is an iterative one, as represented by control flow arrow 10712. Further, the steps of the financial analysis flowchart 10702 can be repeatedly performed for the same or different BOM groups, and can be performed in any order. Therefore, the steps of the financial analysis flowchart 10702 are provided in FIG. 107 for purposes of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>Strategic Planning</p>
    <p>The customer corporate entity can utilize the present invention to perform a strategic planning process. The overall goal of the strategic planning process is to develop a future product direction and/or future business strategy that cannot be easily duplicated by competitors. This future product direction and/or business strategy leverages the customer corporate entity's patent protection and technology ownership. The strategic planning process may result in considerable business process re-engineering based on future business analysis.</p>
    <p>An example of the strategic planning process is represented by flowchart 10802 shown in FIG. 108. In step 10806, BOM data for a contemplated new product is received. This BOM data may have been generated by the R&amp;D department, for example. This BOM data is loaded into the BOM databases 626 in the manner described above.</p>
    <p>In step 10808, an operator associated with the customer corporate entity maps the customer corporate entity's patents (both owned and licensed) to the new future product. The operator also maps competitors' patents to the new future product.</p>
    <p>In step 10810, the operator issues instructions to run patent mapping reports pertaining to the BOM group of the proposed future product. The operator also issues reports to run clustering/bracketing reports for the proposed future product. The patent mapping module 1002 and the patent clustering/bracketing module 1008 in the enterprise server 314 automatically runs these reports in the manner discussed above.</p>
    <p>From these methodology reports, the operator is able to determine if the proposed future product is adequately protected by the patents which the customer corporate entity currently owns or licenses. If the proposed future product is not adequately covered by the customer corporate entity's current patents, then the customer corporate entity may consider whether or not it should prepare and file additional patent applications to further cover the proposed future product.</p>
    <p>Also from these methodology reports, the operator can determine if the features of the proposed future product are covered by the patents owned by others. If some features of the proposed future product are covered by patents owned by others, then the customer corporate entity can consider whether it should license the patents, purchase the patents, modify the proposed future product in order to design around the patents, ignore the patents, abandon plans for the proposed future product, etc.</p>
    <p>The above operation is described as being performed by a single operator. In practice, the above operation may require the involvement of many people with knowledge in many different fields and having different abilities (or expert systems with this knowledge and abilities).</p>
    <p>The above analysis and decision making process performed by the customer corporate entity may involve running additional methodology reports, such as patent citation reports, patent aging reports, inventorship reports, and financial reports.</p>
    <p>It is noted that the steps of the strategic planning flowchart 10802 shown in FIG. 108 are only representative of the type of tactical and strategic functions that can be performed based on the analysis and methodology reports that are automatically prepared by the analysis modules 416.</p>
    <p>The strategic planning process is an iterative one, as represented by control flow arrow 10812. The steps of the strategic planning flowchart 10802 can be performed repeatedly, and in any order. Additional steps can be added to represent the additional strategic planning functions mentioned above. Accordingly, the steps of the strategic planning flowchart 10802 shown in FIG. 108 are provided for purposes of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>Integrated Methodology Embodiment</p>
    <p>The functions and methodologies described above can be performed individually or in any combination to achieve the objectives of the customer corporate entity. For example, at times, the customer may wish to run individual reports to examine a particular aspect of its business, such as the remaining patent terms of patents that map to a particular product line. At other times, the customer may wish to run a combination of reports to analyze a larger part of its business, such as a strategic planning analysis to develop a patent strategy for a proposed future product. At still other times, the customer may wish to perform an extensive and integrated examination of its business from a patent-centric and group-oriented point of view.</p>
    <p>An example of such an integrated methodology is represented by a flowchart 10902 in FIG. 109. In this example, the patent mapping and mining process (described above with reference to FIG. 102) is combined with the situation assessment process (see FIGS. 103-107) and the strategic planning process (see FIG. 108).</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the patent mapping and mining process, the situation assessment process, and the strategic planning process can be performed individually or in any combination with any other functions described herein according to the needs, requirements, and characteristics of the particular corporate entity being served.</p>

In fact, the present invention can support and provide any display format, display window, or display screen useful for enabling operators to view and interact with the data and the data processing described herein. Accordingly, the display screens, display windows, and the display formats shown in the figures and discussed herein are provided solely for purposes of illustration, and not limitation.</p>
    <p>User Login</p>
    <p>FIG. 116 illustrates an example user login window 11602. An operator at a client 304, 306 enters information into the fields of the login window 11602 in order to log into and establish a new session with the Enterprise server 314.</p>
    <p>In order to establish a session with the Enterprise server 314, the operator enters his user name in a login field 11608, and enters his password into a password field 11610. If the operator wishes to connect with the Enterprise server 314 via a specific server, then the operator enters the address of this server in a server field 11604. If the customer's network is configured to use "fire walls" with proxy servers, the operator enters information about the proxy server(s) in the proxy field 11606.</p>
    <p>Console</p>
    <p>FIGS. 18 and 58 depict example display formats wherein a group hierarchy is graphically illustrated in a first window or pane, and a list of patents and other documents contained in one of the groups of the group hierarchy is displayed in a second window or pane. These example display formats of FIGS. 18 and 58 are herein called the console display format, or simply the console.</p>
    <p>FIG. 117 illustrates a console according to an alternative embodiment of the invention. The console 11702 includes a first window or pane 11704, a second window or pane 11706, and a third window or pane 11708. The first pane 11704 is also called the group pane 11704, the second pane 11706 is also called the document pane 11706, and the third pane 11708 is also called the notes pane 11708.</p>
    <p>A group hierarchy is depicted in the group pane 11704. In the example of FIG. 117, the top level or root group in the group hierarchy is called the repository group 11710. The child groups of the repository group 11710 are not shown in FIG. 117 (i.e., the operator has not expanded the repository group 11710 in the group pane 11704). The child groups of the repository group 11710 are shown in FIG. 133 (i.e., the operator has expanded the repository group 11710 in the group pane 11704 in the example of FIG. 133).</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 117, the document pane 11706 includes a list of patents and other documents which are contained within a group selected from the group hierarchy depicted in the group pane 11704. The patents and documents are listed in a tabular or "spreadsheet" format. The list of patents and documents in the document pane 11706 includes both the patent numbers and patent bibliographical information for the patents, and bibliographic information for the non-patent documents. Such patent bibliographic information displayed in the document pane 11706 includes the title, abstract, inventor, class, issue date, and user-defined keywords. All additional patent bibliographic information can be viewed in the document pane 11706 by utilizing the horizontal scroll bar 11720 to sideways scroll in the document pane 11706. Other embodiments of the invention allow the user to select an arbitrary number of bibliographic fields to view. In example of FIG. 117, no patents are listed in the document pane 11706 because a group has not been selected in the group hierarchy depicted in the group pane 11704.</p>
    <p>The operator can restructure the group hierarchy displayed in the Group pane 11704 using well-known drag-and-drop operations. The operator can add any of the documents displayed in the Document pane 11706 to any group in the group hierarchy displayed in the Group pane 11704 by using well-known drag-and-drop operations.</p>
    <p>The notes pane 11708 displays a list of the notes associated with either a group selected in the group pane 11704, or a patent or document selected in the document pane 11706. The list of notes in the notes pane 11708 is presented in a tabular or "spreadsheet" format. The list of notes in the notes pane 11708 includes information that identifies the type of the note (that is, either a patent/document note or a group note), and the title of the note. All other bibliographic or other information relating to notes can be viewed by manipulating the horizontal scroll bar 11722 in order to sideways scroll in the notes pane 11708.</p>
    <p>As indicated above, FIG. 133 illustrates an example console 13302 wherein the repository group 11710 is expanded in the group pane 11704 so that its child groups are shown. In the example of FIG. 133, a group called "analog special effects controller subassembly" 13304 has been selected. Accordingly, a list of all patents and other documents in the selected group 13304 is displayed in the document pane 11706. In the example of FIG. 133, the selected group 13304 includes a single patent, U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,013.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, the operator can view the text and/or image of any patent or other document listed in the document pane 11706 by selecting the patent or document using well know item selection techniques. An operator can select a patent, for example, by double clicking on the patent number, or by using any other type of well known operator navigation procedure.</p>
    <p>Suppose that the operator selects, from the document pane 11706, U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,013. In accordance with this selection, the user interface module 11404 displays the text of the selected patent in a text window 12302, (see FIG. 123), and the image of the selected patent in an image window 12402 (see FIG. 124). The operator may selectively view the text window 12302 individually, the image window 12402 individually, or the text window 12302 and the image window 12402 simultaneously.</p>
    <p>FIG. 118 illustrates an example console 11802 wherein the group hierarchy 11712 (with the repository group 11710 as the root) is depicted in the group pane 11704. The repository group 11710 is selected in the example of FIG. 1118. Accordingly, a list of all patents and other documents in the repository group 11710 is displayed in the document pane 11706. Accordingly, by opening the folder corresponding to the repository group 11710 in the group pane 11704, the operator can view all patents that are contained in the patent repository (that is, all patents that are in the patent database 614), and, in fact, can view all documents that are in the repository.</p>
    <p>Console Tool Bars</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 117, a Group toolbar 11724 is displayed in the group pane 11704. The tools in the Group toolbar 11724 are used to manipulate the groups of the group hierarchy displayed in the group pane 11704. A Document toolbar 11726 is displayed in the second pane. The tools in the Document toolbar 11726 are used to manipulate the documents listed in the document pane 11706. A Note toolbar 11728 is displayed in a notes pane 11708. The tools in the Note toolbar 11728 are used to manipulate the notes listed in the notes pane 11708.</p>

An operator presses a Delete Group button 13504 in order to delete the group selected in the Group pane 11704. An operator presses a create New Group button 13506 in order to create a new group. The new group is created as a child group of the group selected in the Group pane 11704.</p>
    <p>An operator presses a Show Group Properties button 13508 in the Group toolbar 11724 in order to view and edit the properties of the group selected in the Group pane 11704. An operator presses an Import Data button 13510 in order to import data from an external data file into the repository 612, 602. An operator presses an Export Data button 13512 in order to export data from the repository 612, 602 into a user specified location, such as an external file.</p>
    <p>An operator presses a Refresh Data button 13514 in the Group toolbar 11724 in order to refresh the listing of all data in the Group pane 11704, the Document pane 11706, and the Notes pane 11708. Refresh is needed to synchronize multi-user access to the database. Such data refresh is performed by reading from the databases 316. An operator presses a Reports button 13516 in order to execute methodology reports.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 136, an operator presses a Show Text button 13602 in the Document toolbar 11726 in order to display the text of a document selected in the Document window 11706. An operator presses a Show Image button 13604 in order to display the image of the document selected in the Document pane 11706. Examples of the display of text and images are shown in FIGS. 123 and 124.</p>
    <p>An operator selects a Skim Images button 13606 in the Document toolbar 11726 in order to perform a Skim Images function. In accordance with the Skim Images function, the first image page of each document listed in the Document window 11706 is displayed in succession by repeatedly clicking the Show Images button 13606.</p>
    <p>An operator presses an Add Patent button 13608 in order to add a new patent or document to the list of patents displayed in the Document pane 11706 (that is, to add a new patent or document to the group selected in the Group pane 11704). An operator presses a delete patent button 13610 in order to delete the patent or document selected in the Document pane 11706 from the group selected in the Group pane 11704 (this does not delete the document from the repository).</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 137, an operator presses an Add new Group Note button 13702 in order to add a new group note to a group selected in the Group pane 11704. An operator presses an Add New Patent/Document Note button 13704 in order to add a new patent note to the patent or document selected in the document pane 11706.</p>
    <p>An operator presses a Delete The Selected Group Or Patent Note button 13706 in order to delete the note selected in the Notes window 11708. An operator presses the Sort Notes By Type button 13708 in order to sort the list of notes depicted in the Notes window 11708 by their type (that is, by group or by patent). An operator presses a Sort Notes By Title button 13710 in order to sort the list of notes depicted in the Notes window 11708 according to their titles.</p>
    <p>Various ones of these functions that are invoked by pressing buttons in the Group toolbar 11724, the Document toolbar 11726, and the note toolbar 11728 are further described in the following sections.</p>
    <p>Creating a New Group</p>
    <p>An operator presses the Create New Group button 13506 in the Group toolbar 11724 in order to create a new group in the group hierarchy displayed in the Group pane 11704. The new group is created as a child group of the group selected in the Group pane 11704.</p>
    <p>Consider, for example, the Example console 11902 illustrated in FIG. 119. Assume that the operator presses the Create New Group button 13506 when a group entitled "analog special effects controller subassembly" 11906 is selected. In this case, a new group 11904 is created as a child group of the selected group 11906. The default name of the new group 11904 is "A New Group". The name of the new group 11904 can then be modified using well-known procedures (such as by selecting the new group 11906, selecting a Rename command, and then typing in a new name for the new group 11904). FIG. 120 illustrates a scenario where the new group 11904 has been renamed as "Sample New Name."</p>
    <p>Editing Group Properties</p>
    <p>An operator presses the Show Group Properties button 13508 in the Group toolbar 11724 in order to view and edit the properties of the group selected in the Group pane 11704. Group Viewing And Editing windows 12602 are shown in FIGS. 126 and 127. Referring first to FIG. 127, a Group Properties tab 12606 is displayed. The operator can view and edit general information about the group selected in the Group pane 11704 by using the General Group Properties tab 12606. In particular, the operator can view and edit the group name via a Name field 12608, and a description about the group via a Description field 12610. The General Group Properties tab 12606 also displays the Group Identifier of the group selected in the Group pane 11704 in a field 12612.</p>
    <p>FIG. 126 depicts a Group Properties Security tab 12604 in which the operator can view and enter security access information for the selected group. In particular, the operator can edit the users who have access to the selected group in a field 12608, and also can specify the access level for each of these users via fields 12610.</p>
    <p>It is noted that access to the General Group Properties tab 12606 and the Group Properties Security tab 12604 is limited to operators having sufficiently high access levels with respect to the selected group.</p>
    <p>Shared Groups</p>
    <p>In an embodiment of the invention, shared groups are graphically depicted in the console using a stacked folders icon 15302 (FIG. 153). FIG. 154 shows an example console 15402 where both an "Only Luke can see!" group 15404 and an "Oscar Project" group 15408 share a "November Project" group 15406, which is a shared group.</p>
    <p>FIG. 156 illustrates a group links tab 15602, which is the interface to additional group properties. These group properties in the group links table 15602 pertain to the links associated with a selected group. The scenario shown in FIG. 156 corresponds to the example of FIG. 154. Accordingly, in FIG. 156, the November Project group is shown as being a child of the Oscar project group and the Only Luke can see! group, which are both shown as being children of the Repository group. The operator can double click (or otherwise select) any link to open the lowest level data object, in this case the November Project group.</p>
    <p>Invoking Patent-Centric and Group-Oriented Analysis Functions</p>
    <p>An operator presses the Run Reports button 13516 in the Group toolbar 11724 in order to execute methodology reports. These methodology reports are performed by the Analysis modules 416 in the Enterprise server 316 (see FIG. 10), and are described above.</p>
    <p>Upon the pressing of the Run Report button 13516, a Report Generator screen 12802 is displayed (FIG. 128). The operator selects the report or function that is to be executed by pressing a button 12806. This results in displaying a list of all available reports/functions. An example display of this function/reports list 12906 is shown in FIG. 129. The operator selects one of the function/reports from this list in a well-known manner. In the example of FIG. 128, the operator has selected the inventor employment information function (which is executed by the inventor employment information module 1014 of the Enterprise server 314).</p>
    <p>The operator can enter information into the other fields of the report generator screen 12802 in order to define and/or limit the scope of the function that is to be performed. In particular, the operator can specify the number of levels in the group hierarchy to consider in performing the function (specified in field 12804) by entering the appropriate level information into a field 12810. If, for example, the operator enters the value 1 into field 12810, then only the group selected in the Group pane 11704 is considered in performing the selected function. If, instead, the operator enters the value 2 into field 12810, then both the selected group and its immediate child group (one level down from the selected group) are considered in performing the selected function. In the example of FIG. 128, the operator has entered the value 5 into field 12810. Accordingly, in performing the inventor employment information function, both the selected group and four levels of its child groups are considered.</p>
    <p>The operator can limit the patents which are to be considered in performing the selected function by patent expiration dates by entering information into fields 12812. In the example of FIG. 128, all patents which are expiring or which have expired between the dates of Jan. 1, 1900 and Dec. 21, 2100 are considered in performing employment information function.</p>
    <p>The operator can also limit the patents which are to be considered in performing the selected function according to the remaining patent terms of the patents. This information is entered into fields 12814. In the example of FIG. 128, only patents with remaining patent terms between three years and 10 years are considered in performing the inventor employment information function.</p>
    <p>Once the operator has defined the function that is to be performed by entering information into the report generator screen 12802, the operator presses the Execute button 12808 in order to execute the selected function.</p>
    <p>Adding Documents to a Group</p>
    <p>The operator presses an Add a Patent/Document button 13608 in the Document toolbar 11726 in order to add a patent or some other document to the group selected in the Group window 11704. Upon pressing the Add a Patent/Document button 13608, a new Document window 13006 is displayed (FIG. 130). The operator inserts information identifying the document that is to be added to the selected group in a Document Name field 13008. In an alternative embodiment, the operator can select a document for insertion into the selected group by browsing through a graphical list of the documents in the Document databases 612, and use well-known drag and drop techniques to place documents into the selected group.</p>
    <p>Adding a Document Note</p>
    <p>The operator presses the Add a New Patent/Document Note button 13704 in the note toolbar 11728 in order to add a new note to a document. Consider the example shown in FIG. 125. In this example, a Text window 12506 displays a portion of the text from U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,013. The present invention allows the operator to attach a note to any portion of this patent. Suppose that the operator wishes to attach a note to the title, "Apparatus for Editing Videotapes" 12510. According to the present invention, the operator selects a pen 12508, and then uses the selected pen 12508 to highlight the title 12510. The operator then presses the Add a New Patent/Document Note button 13704. This results in a new note being created. This new note is displayed in a Note window 12514. The operator can enter a title for the note in field 12520, and can enter the text or other information for the note in field 12524. The operator can also indicate whether this note represents attorney work product via field 12522.</p>
    <p>The Note window 12514 includes location information that identifies the location of the text in the document to which the note is linked. This location information is represented by reference numbers 12516 and 12544. The location information 12516 indicates that the note is attached to a portion of U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,013 starting at line 6. The location information 12544 indicates that this portion in U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,013 represents bibliographical information portion (indicated by the symbol B1).</p>
    <p>In some embodiments, it is not necessary for the operator to press the Add a New Patent/Document Note button 13704. Instead, the new note is automatically created once the selected pen 12508 is used to highlight the title 12510. Other aspects of the present invention relating to creating and manipulating notes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,681, U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,679, pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/341,129, and pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/590,082, incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
    <p>The Notes window 12514 includes an Unlink button 12534 which, when pressed, operates to unlink the note from the document. The note is then called a floating note. The Notes window 12514 also includes a Contract button 12536 which operates to reduce the area on the display screen which is used to display notes. The Notes window 12514 also includes an Expand button 12538 which operates to increase the amount of space on the display screen which is used to display notes.</p>
    <p>As described above, the Notes pane 11708 in the console 12502 lists the notes associated with the selected document in the Document pane 11706, or the selected group in the Group pane 11704. In the example of FIG. 125, the Notes window 11708 lists the notes associated with the document selected in the Document pane 11706. The document selected in Document pane 11706 is U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,013. As just explained above, the operator has created a new note that is linked to this selected document. The title of this new note is "Simple Note". Accordingly, this note is listed in the Notes window 11708. The listing corresponding to this new note indicates the type of a note (in this case, the type is P, indicating a patent note) and the title of the new note (in this case, the title is "Simple Note"). Additional information relating to the new note, and any other notes listed in the Notes pane 11708, can be viewed by sideways scrolling in the Notes pane 11708 by use of the horizontal scroll bar 11722.</p>
    <p>Adding a Group Note</p>
    <p>The operator presses the Add a New Group Note button 13702 in the Note toolbar 11728 in order to create a new group note for the group selected in the group pane 11704. Upon selection of the Add a New Group Note button 13702, a New Group window 13406 is displayed (FIG. 134). In the New Group window 13406, the user can enter the title of the group note in field 13410, and can enter information for the group note in field 13408. The operator can also indicate whether the group note constitutes attorney work product by checking field 13412.</p>
    <p>The Notes pane 11708 lists the notes corresponding to the document selected in the Document pane 11706, or the group selected in the Group pane 11704. In the example of FIG. 134, the group titled "Analog special effects controller subsystem" 13404 is selected. Accordingly, the Notes pane 11708 lists all group notes associated with this selected group 13404. The New Group note (represented by the data in the New Group window 13406) is linked to the selected group 13404. Accordingly, the new group note is listed in the notes pane 11708. The listing for this new group note indicates the type of the note (in this case, the type is C, for a case or group note) and the title of the group note (in the example of FIG. 134, the title is "Purpose of this group"). Other information pertaining to the group notes can be viewed in the Notes pane 11708 by horizontally scrolling in the Notes pane 11708 by using the horizontal scroll bar 11722.</p>
    <p>Searching</p>
    <p>The operator presses the Search button 13502 in the Group toolbar 11724 in order to perform a search of the data in the databases 316. Upon pressing the Search button 13502, a search screen 12102 is displayed (FIG. 121). Other example search screens are shown in FIGS. 53 and 57. The operator enters information into the Search screen 12102 in order to define the parameters of a new search. In the example of FIG. 121, the operator has entered the phrase "video tape" into an abstract field 12104. Accordingly, the operator has indicated that he wishes to conduct a new search for all documents where the phrase "video tape" appears in the abstract.</p>
    <p>FIG. 122 illustrates an example console 12202 that results after the search defined in the example Search screen 12102 (FIG. 121) is performed. According to the present invention, a new temporary group 12204 (called New Search) is created to hold the search results (in other words, the documents that are identified from performance of the search are placed in the new group 12204 called "New Search"). This new group 12204 is created as a child group of the group that was selected in the group pane 11704 when the search was executed.</p>
    <p>A list of the documents identified by operation of the search is displayed in the Document pane 11706. The operator can add these documents to any other group in the group hierarchy (displayed in the Group pane 11704) using well-known drag-and-drop operations. Alternatively, the operator can convert the new group 12204 to a permanent group (pre-defined or user-defined), and maintain these documents in the permanent group 12204 entitled "New Search".</p>
    <p>FIG. 155 illustrates an example console 15502 where a temporary group 15504 called "New Search Group" has been created. Temporary groups may be color coded differently from other groups in the group hierarchy 15508. In the embodiment of FIG. 155, the group toolbar 11724 includes a "regular group" button 15506. By pressing the regular group button 15506, the temporary group 15504 becomes a permanent group. In an embodiment of the invention, the type of the new permanent group is the same as the permanent group's immediate parent. Thus, if the parent is a user-defined group, then the new permanent group is a user-defined group. If the parent is a BOM group, then the new permanent group is a BOM group. In an alternate embodiment, the operator is prompted to enter a type for the temporary group 15504. In another embodiment, the type is predefined, such as BOM.</p>
    <p>In an embodiment of the invention, a temporary group is automatically deleted at some time in the future, such as after a timeout or at the conclusion of the session with the enterprise server 314, if not converted to a permanent group before then.</p>
    <p>Web Searching</p>
    <p>The operation of a web client 304 with regard to searching for data in the databases 316 according to an embodiment of the invention is described in this section. It should be understood, however, that the search capabilities described herein are applicable to all clients 304,306 in various embodiments of the invention. That is, in some embodiments of the invention, all clients 304,306 include at least the capabilities described herein.</p>
    <p>In the following, searching at the web clients 304 is described in the context of patent searching. However, the following description applies to searching for all types of documents.</p>
    <p>An operator at a web client 304 presses the Search button 13502 in the Group toolbar 11724 in order to access the search capabilities of the present invention. Upon pressing the Search button 13502, a Patent Search screen or window 14002 is displayed (FIG. 140). This Patent Search screen 14002 is similar to the one shown in FIG. 53. In fact, some embodiments use the Patent Search screen 5302 shown in FIG. 53. Other embodiments use both the Patent Search screens 5302 and 14002 shown in FIGS. 53 and 140, respectively.</p>
    <p>The operator enters information into the fields of the Patent Search screen 14002 in order to define the parameters of the search. For example, the operator can define the search in terms of patent number, title, inventor, assignee, class, user-defined key words, date of issue, abstract, and/or full patent text by entering search terms into the corresponding fields of the Patent Search screen 140. Also, the operator can select which fields to display in the search results by appropriate selection of the Check Box fields 14004. Further, the operator can order the display or printing of the search results according to a number of factors, such as patent number, assignee, expiration date, number of years remaining in patent term, or score. The score corresponds to the number of hits of the search parameters in a patent. The operator orders the search results by appropriate selection in the Order field 14006. The operator can also specify the number of patents in the search results to display per screen by entering the appropriate information in field 14008.</p>
    <p>In the example of FIG. 140, the operator has entered the search term "PCMCIA" in the Abstract field. In other words, the search defined by the operator is one that will identify all patents having abstracts with one or more occurrences of the word "PCMCIA". After the operator has fully defined the search in the Patent Search screen 14002, the operator presses the search button 14010 in order to execute the search.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 141-143 illustrate example Search Results screens corresponding to the search specified in the example Patent Search screen 14002 of FIG. 140. The execution of this search identified 85 patents. This information is indicated at reference number 14104 in Search Results screen 14102. Search Results screen 14102 displays information on the first 10 of these 85 patents. This is indicated at reference number 14106. Search Results screen 14202 (FIG. 142) displays information on the second 10 of these 85 patents. This is indicated at reference number 14204. Search Results screen 14302 displays information corresponding to the third 10 of these 85 patents. This is indicated at reference number 14304. The operator can display information on different ones of the 85 patents by use of the navigation arrows 14108. In other words, the operator can scroll through search results screens 14102, 14202, 14302 by use of the navigation arrows 14108.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 141, the information on the patents identified by performing the search is presented in a tabular format. The information displayed for each patent includes the score (that is, the number of hits of the search parameters in the patent), the patent number, and the title. More or less information can be displayed for each patent. This is controlled by the operator by appropriately checking the check boxes 14004 in the Patent Search screen 14002.</p>
    <p>The information for each patent also includes an indication of whether or not the patent is in the local repository (i.e., stored in the patent database 614). This is indicated in the column called "In Repository?" In the example of FIGS. 141-143, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,030 is not in the patent database 614. However, U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,597 is stored in the patent database 614.</p>
    <p>The operator can view additional information on any of the patents listed in the Search Results screens 14102,14202,14302 by selecting the patent (for example, by double-clicking on the patent number in the list of patents). The extent of the information that is displayed for a selected patent depends on whether or not the patent is stored in the patent database 614. If the patent is not stored in the patent database, then patent bibliographic information (retrieved from the patent bibliographic databases 604) is displayed for the selected patent. An example display of such patent bibliographic information for a selected patent is shown in FIG. 144. The information in this example display 14402 corresponds to U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,404 (which the operator selected by selecting entry 14110 in the Search Results screen 14102 of FIG. 141).</p>
    <p>The display screen 14402 includes patent bibliographic information 14404 on U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,404. Also, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the display screen 14402 also includes text corresponding to the abstract 14406 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,404. In other words, for patents not stored in the patent database 614, the system of the present invention maintains both patent bibliographic information and the abstract. Such patent bibliographic information and abstract are stored in the patent bibliographic databases 604. (For example, the abstract can be stored in an Abstract database that is keyed to the primary patent table 1222 according to document<sub>--</sub> ID.)</p>
    <p>FIGS. 145A-145C depict example patent information screens that display patent information on patents that are contained in the Patent database 614. The Patent display screen 14502 in FIG. 145A corresponds to U.S. Pat. No. 5,615,328 (which the operator selected by double-clicking on entry 14310 in the Search Results screen 14302 of FIG. 143).</p>
    <p>The operator can elect to display the text of the selected patent by pressing the Text button 14504. In the example of FIGS. 145A-145C, the operator has pressed the Text button 14504. Accordingly, the text of the selected patent is displayed in the Patent Information screens of FIGS. 145A-145C. FIGS. 145A-145C represent the first three (of 15) electronic pages of the text of the selected patent.</p>
    <p>The operator presses an Image button 14506 to display the images of the selected patent. An example of such a display is shown in FIG. 56 (although the example in FIG. 56 does not correspond to U.S. Pat. No. 5,615,328). The operator presses a Text And Image button 14508 to simultaneously display the text and images of the selected patent. An example display of such text and image is shown in FIG. 112 (although the example display in FIG. 112 does not correspond to U.S. Pat. No. 5,615,328 shown in FIG. 145A). If the operator wishes to initiate a new search, the operator presses a New Search button 14510. This causes the Patent Search screen 14002 (FIG. 140) to be displayed.</p>
    <p>The selected patent as displayed in the display screens of FIGS. 145A-145C is internally hyperlinked. Such hyperlinks are represented by buttons 14524. This button represented hyperlinking is a well known use of HTML.</p>
    <p>If the operator wishes to view the bibliography of the selected patent, for example, then the operator presses the Bibliography button 14512. The operator presses the Cross Reference To Related Applications button 14516 to view cross-reference information of the selected patent. The operator presses the Brief Description Of The Drawings button 14518 to view the brief description of the drawings section of the selected patent. The operator presses the Detailed Description Of The Invention button 14520 to view the detailed description section of the selected patent. The operator presses the Claims button 14522 to view the claims section of the selected patent.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the invention implements such internal hyperlinking using a linked list of nodes, wherein each node corresponds to a section of the selected patent. Specifically, each node includes a link to the corresponding section of the selected patent. When the operator selects one of the Internal Linking buttons 14524, the invention traverses through the linked list corresponding to the selected patent until it finds the node corresponding to the section that the operator wishes to view. The invention then follows the link stored in the node to access the data corresponding to the section that the operator wishes to view. Additional details pertaining to this linked list is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,679, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <p>The Patent Information display screens in FIGS. 145A-145C may also linked to external objects, such as other patents, documents, etc. In other words, the selected document is linked to external objects. For example, if the operator wishes to view the patent representing the immediate parent of the selected patent, then the operator presses a Parent Case Text button 14514. This results in the parent patent being retrieved and displayed.</p>
    <p>The selected patent may also be linked to references to other documents that are contained in the selected patent. For example, the selected patent as displayed in FIGS. 145A-145C includes links to cited U.S. patent documents. These links are represented by reference numbers 14526 and 14528. Hyperlinks in the selected patent are denoted by underlining. Alternatively, any other method of highlighting can be used, such as fonts, color coding, symbols, icons, etc.</p>
    <p>The selected patent may also include links to citations of other publications, as represented by reference number 14530, and citations to related applications, as represented by reference number 14532.</p>
    <p>For reference purposes, citations to documents that are linked to the actual documents are called linked citations.</p>
    <p>The operator can view the document corresponding to any linked citation by selecting that linked citation. For example, FIG. 146 illustrates a display screen that shows information pertaining to U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,830. This display screen 14602 was generated pursuant to the operator selecting a corresponding linked citation 14536 in the selected patent (see FIG. 145B). In the display screen 14602 of FIG. 146, the operator can elect to electronically order a copy of the patent from a third party provider by pressing an Order button 14604.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIGS. 145A-145C, not all document citations contained in the selected patent are linked to the cited documents. For example, referring to FIG. 145B, the citation to U.S. Pat. No. 5,430,681 is not linked to the cited document (that is, it is not linked to an electronic copy of U.S. Pat. No. 5,430,681). According to the present invention, a citation in a document being displayed is linked to the cited reference only if that cited reference is represented in the document bibliographic databases 602 and/or the document databases 612. In other words, the documents corresponding to linked citations are represented in the document bibliographic databases 602 and/or the document databases 612.</p>
    <p>A citation in a document being displayed is not a linked citation if the corresponding document is not represented in the document bibliographic databases 602 or the document databases 612. Accordingly, in the example of FIG. 145B, the document bibliographic databases 602 and the document databases 612 include no information pertaining to U.S. Pat. No. 5,430,681.</p>
    <p>In other words, whether a citation to a document is linked to the document depends on whether or not the databases 316 store information on that document. If the databases 316 store information on the document, then the citation to the document is linked to the document (i.e., the citation is a linked citation). Otherwise, the citation to the document is not linked to the document (i.e., the citation is not a linked citation).</p>
    <p>According to an embodiment of the invention, hyperlinking information is stored in a table in the databases 316. This hyperlinking table stores information pertaining to the links between documents. For a particular document, the hyperlinking table stores information that identifies the links between that particular document and other documents (these other documents being cited in the particular document). More particularly, each entry of this table corresponds to a linked citation, and stores information identifying both ends of the link of the linked citation. Specifically, each entry stores information that identifies a first document and the linked portion in the first document, and also includes information that identifies the object to which the linked portion in the first document is linked. This object may be a second document, for example. In the example of FIGS. 145A-145C, the hyperlinking table includes hyperlinking information that identifies the documents that are linked to the patent being displayed (that is, U.S. Pat. No. 5,615,328).</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment, when a document is displayed, the document is automatically analyzed to identify and generate a list of all citations to other documents contained in the document. This list is then compared to the information stored in the databases 316. If the databases 316 have stored therein information on a document in the list, then the citation to that document becomes a linked citation. Otherwise, the citation to the document does not become a linked citation.</p>
    <p>The invention also allows a document to have user-defined links. In operation, an operator would select a portion of a document being displayed, and then link that portion to some object. That object may be internal to the document (that is, linking a portion of a patent to another portion of the same patent), or external to the document (for example, linking a portion of a patent to another document or to a website). One portion corresponding to a user-defined link can completely or partially overlap with another portion corresponding to a user-defined link.</p>
    <p>For example, as represented in FIG. 145C, the user has selected the company name "International Business Machines Corporation" and has linked this selected portion 14534 of the document being displayed to an external object. In the example of FIG. 145C, the operator has linked this portion 14534 of the document being displayed to the IBM patent website. Accordingly, when the operator selects this linked portion 14534, the IBM website is accessed.</p>
    <p>Preferably, information pertaining to user-defined links is stored in a user-defined linking table in the databases 316. Each entry of this table corresponds to a user-defined link, and stores information identifying both ends of the link. Specifically, each entry stores information that identifies the document and the linked portion in the document, and also includes information that identifies the object to which the linked portion in the document is linked.</p>
    <p>In practice, when the operator selects a linked citation, the client 304,306 generates a request to the Enterprise server 314 to retrieve information pertaining to the document corresponding to that linked citation (assuming that such information is not already stored in the cache within the client 304,306). In the case of web clients 304, patent-centric URL commands are sent to the Enterprise server 314 (see FIG. 151).</p>
    <p>Referring again to the Search Results screens in FIGS. 141-143, the operator can press a Get Results In File button 14194 to write the search results to a user-specified file. The operator can also press an "In Repository" button 14190 to view a subset of the search results corresponding to patents that are in the local patent repository (that is, patents that are in the Patent database 614). An example display screen that results from pressing the "In Repository" button 14190 is presented in FIG. 147.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 141, the operator can press a "Not In Repository" button 14192 in order to view a subset of the search results corresponding to patents that are not in the Patent database 614. This list of patents not in the Patent database 614 may be useful to the operator. For example, the operator can generate a purchase order to obtain these patents using this list.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 147, the Search Results: Patents In Repository display screen 14702 includes a Skim Images button 14704. The operator presses the Skim Images button 14704 in order to view the first image page of each of the patents listed in table 14706 (this table lists the patents from the search results that are contained in the Patent database 614). The operator displays the first image page of successive patents listed in table 14706 by repeatedly clicking the Skip Images button 14704.</p>
    <p>A Skip Images display screen 14802 is shown in FIG. 148. This Skim Images Display screen 14802 results from clicking the Skip Images button 14704 a first time (that is, the image displayed in the Skip Images display screen 14802 corresponds to the first page of the first patent listed in table 14706). The operator can view the first image page of either a previous patent or a next patent in the list 14706 by use of the Navigation buttons 14806.</p>
    <p>With regard to the web client 304, pressing the Skip Images button 14704 causes the web browser 808 to generate a patent-centric URL command. This patent-centric URL command represents a request to the Enterprise server 314 to retrieve the first image page of the associated patent (that is, the next patent in the list 14706). Enterprise server 314 responds by returning raw data corresponding to this image page. The translator 804 in the web server 310 converts this raw data to HTML data. The HTML data is sent to the web client 304. The browser 808 in the web client 304 receives this HTML data, and renders the HTML data in order to display the first image page of the patent, as shown by way of example in FIG. 148.</p>
    <p>An example patent-centric URL command is displayed in field 14804 of the Skim Images display 14802.</p>
    <p>The Skim Images feature of the present invention is analogous to a manual search of patents in the shoes of the USPTO Search Room. During such manual searches, practitioners often quickly thumb through the patents in a patent shoe by looking at the first pages of the patents. The Skim Images feature of the present invention enables an operator to quickly electronically scan over the first image pages of the patents in the list 14706, thereby emulating a manual search through the shoes in the PTO Search Room. It should be noted that the images displayed to the user are preferably HTML data rendered by the browser 808.</p>
    <p>Importing Data</p>
    <p>The operator presses the Import Data button 13510 in the Group toolbar 11724 in order to import data from an external location into the repository 612,602. Upon pressing the Import Data button 13510, an Import Data window 13102 is displayed (FIG. 131). In the Import Data window 13102, the user specifies the external drive in field 13104 (the user can browse through the available storage locations by pressing button 13106). The files in this selected location are displayed in window 13108. The operator enters the name of the file to import in field 13110. The type of this file (such as text, database, spreadsheet, etc.) is entered in field 13112. After specifying the parameters of the import operation, the operator presses the Open button 13190 in order to import the selected file from the selected external storage location into the repository 612, 602.</p>
    <p>Exporting Data</p>
    <p>The operator presses the Export Data button 13512 in the Group toolbar 11724 in order to export data from the repository 612,602 to an external location, such as an external file. Upon pressing the Export Data button 13512, an Export window 13202 is displayed (FIG. 132). In the Export window 13202, the operator enters the external location of the file to which the export operation is to be directed. This external location is entered in field 13204. It is noted that the operator can browse through all available external locations by pressing button 13206. A list of the files located in the external location (specified in field 13204) is displayed in field 13208. The user enters the name of the external location (to which the data is to be exported) in field 13210. The type of the file (such as text, spreadsheet, database) is entered in field 13212. After the operator has specified the parameters of the export operation, the operator presses the Save button 13290 in order to execute the export data operation.</p>
