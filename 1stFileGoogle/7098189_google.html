    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of wound healing and to the repair and maintenance of healthy skin.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">Skin is subject to insults by many extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors that can adversely affect the skin include ultraviolet radiation (e.g., from sun exposure), environmental pollution, wind, heat, low humidity, harsh surfactants, abrasives, and the like. Intrinsic factors that lead to skin problems include chronological aging and other biochemical changes from within the skin. Whether extrinsic or intrinsic, these factors result in visible signs of skin aging and damage, such as wrinkling, roughness and histological changes. Moreover, to many people, skin wrinkles are a reminder of the disappearance of youth. As a result, the elimination of wrinkles has become a concern for many people. Anti-wrinkle treatments range from cosmetic creams and moisturizers to various forms of cosmetic surgery.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Extrinsic or intrinsic factors may result in the thinning and general degradation of the skin. For example, as the skin naturally ages, there is a reduction in the cells and the blood vessels that supply the skin. There is also a flattening of the dermal-epidermal junction that results in weaker mechanical resistance of this junction. See, for example, Oikarinen, “The Aging of Skin: Chronoaging Versus Photoaging,” Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed., vol. 7, pp. 3–4, 1990, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Skin contains an elaborate network of elastin fibers that is responsible for maintaining its elastic properties. With excessive exposure to sunlight the elastic fiber system becomes hyperplastic, disorganized and ultimately disrupted. This process is known as actinic elastosis and it is a principal cause of wrinkling, discoloration and laxity of the skin in the exposed areas of the body. As new fibroblasts, endothelial cells and keratinocytes form, the skin can repair itself. However, the skin becomes less able to do so as it ages. Therefore, agents that can accelerate the growth and repair of prematurely aged skin are needed.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Wound healing is also accelerated by increased cellular proliferation and migration of certain cell types. The mechanisms involved in wound healing are often divided into four phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and maturation. During inflammation, leucocytes accumulate to combat bacteria and the permeability blood vessel walls increases, leading to swelling. If an infection does not develop the number of leucocytes diminishes. Monocytes replace the leukocytes. Macrophages and lymphocytes release growth factors (cytokines) as well as a number of chemical substances, such as histamine, serotonin, and prostaglandins. These substances help regulate the wound healing process. In the proliferation phase, new fibroblasts, endothelial cells and keratinocytes arise, connective tissue is formed, new blood vessels grow and injured tissue is regenerated. Fibroblasts become dominant after about a week, the inflammation decreases and the strength of the tissues around the wound site increases rapidly. During the maturation phase collagen is laid down and scar tissue is formed. This maturation phase might go on for a long time during which time, tissues of various types are regenerated. In order to obtain an optimal healing of skin and associated tissues, the supply of different vitamins and trace elements as well as nutrients should be sufficient as well as the oxygen supply.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">While certain skin care compositions are available on the market, such compositions do not effectively stimulate the growth of new skin tissues. Hence, there is a need for formulations that not only improve the appearance but also the health of skin. Ideally, such formulations would provide a range of useful activities such as, for example, wound healing, scar reduction, soothing rashes, eliminating wrinkles and reducing the signs of aging.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0008">The invention provides compositions that can stimulate the formation of new skin and gum tissues, facilitate wound healing, and ameliorate the effects of aging. In particular, the compositions and methods of the invention can stimulate cellular proliferation of mammalian fibroblasts or keratinocytes. Not only can these compositions stimulate cell growth and the repair of skin and gum tissues, but they can also stimulate collagen production in mammalian fibroblasts.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Thus, the invention provides compositions comprising a dermatologically or pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an effective amount of a jasmonic acid compound, a gibberellic acid compound or a zeatin compound; wherein the composition can stimulate cellular proliferation of mammalian fibroblasts or keratinocytes. Such compositions are useful for treating wounds, stimulating gum tissue growth and for reversing the effects of aging on skin.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In other embodiments, the invention provides a composition comprising a dermatologically or pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an effective amount of a jasmonic acid compound, a gibberellic acid compound or a zeatin compound; wherein the composition can stimulate collagen production in mammalian fibroblasts. Such compositions are useful for treating wounds, stimulating gum tissue growth and for reversing the effects of aging on skin.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Further embodiments of the invention relate to compositions comprise a dermatologically or pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an effective amount of a hydroxy acid compound, wherein the composition can stimulate cellular proliferation of mammalian fibroblasts or keratinocytes. Such compositions can further comprise an effective amount of a jasmonic acid compound, a gibberellic acid compound or a zeatin compound.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">The present invention also provides an orally acceptable formulation for the treatment of gum tissues comprising an acceptable carrier and an effective amount of a jasmonic acid compound, a gibberellic acid compound or a zeatin compound; wherein the formulation can stimulate cellular proliferation of mammalian fibroblasts or keratinocytes. The composition can stimulate collagen production in mammalian fibroblasts.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising:

    <p num="h-0006">Definitions</p>
    <p num="p-0027">The term “keratinous tissue,” as used herein, refers to keratin-containing layers disposed as the outermost protective covering of mammals (e.g., humans, dogs, cats, etc.) that includes, but is not limited to, skin, lips, hair, toenails, fingernails, cuticles, hooves, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">The term “topical application”, as used herein, means to apply or spread the compositions of the present invention onto the surface of the keratinous tissue.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">The term “dermatologically-acceptable,” as used herein, means that the described compositions or components thereof are suitable for use in contact with mammalian keratinous tissue without undue toxicity, incompatibility, instability, allergic response, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">The term “safe and effective amount” as used herein means an amount of a compound or composition sufficient to significantly induce a positive benefit, such as a positive keratinous tissue appearance or feel benefit, including independently or in combinations the benefits disclosed herein, but low enough to avoid serious side effects, i.e., to provide a reasonable benefit to risk ratio, within the scope of sound judgment of the skilled artisan.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">The term “sagging” as used herein means the laxity, slackness, or the like condition of skin that occurs as a result of loss of, damage to, alterations to, and/or abnormalities in dermal elastin.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">The terms “smoothing” and “softening” as used herein mean altering the surface of the keratinous tissue such that its tactile feel is improved. “Signs of skin aging” include, but are not limited to, all outwardly visible or tactilely perceptible manifestations as well as any other macro or micro effects due to skin aging. Such signs may be induced or caused by intrinsic factors or extrinsic factors, e.g., chronological aging and/or environmental damage. These signs may result from processes that include, but are not limited to, the development of textural discontinuities such as wrinkles and coarse deep wrinkles, skin lines, crevices, bumps, large pores (e.g., associated with adnexal structures such as sweat gland ducts, sebaceous glands, or hair follicles), or unevenness or roughness, loss of skin elasticity (loss and/or inactivation of functional skin elastin), sagging (including puffiness in the eye area and jowls), loss of skin firmness, loss of skin tightness, loss of skin recoil from deformation, discoloration (including under eye circles), blotching, sallowness, hyperpigmented skin regions such as age spots and freckles, keratoses, abnormal differentiation, hyperkeratinization, elastosis, collagen breakdown, and other histological changes in the stratum corneum, dermis, epidermis, the skin vascular system (e.g., telangiectasia or spider vessels), and underlying tissues, especially those proximate to the skin.</p>
    <p num="h-0007">Effects of Aging on Skin</p>
    <p num="p-0033">Skin, which is the external covering of the body, has two components: the epidermis that contains four layers and the dermis, also referred to as the corium, cutis, derma, or true skin, that contains a superficial papillary layer and a deep reticular layer. Collagen constitutes about 80% of the dry weight of the dermis and is the major fibrillar component of human skin. The dermis is composed of connective tissue that contains lymphatics, nerves and nerve endings, blood vessels, sebaceous and sweat glands, and elastic fibers that provide the elastic properties of the skin. The mature fiber contains about 90% elastin and two glycosaminoglycans are present at concentrations of about 2% and 0.1%, respectively (see, e.g., Braverman (1982) J. Invest. Dermatol, 78:434–443). The coarse branching fibers are entwined with collagen fiber bundles in the reticular dermis. The fibers rise from the deeper layers of the papillary layer of the dermis and, as they rise towards the epidermis, they split repeatedly become finer and form a network.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">As humans age, there are changes in the quantity and integrity of dermal elastic tissue (Warren et al. (1991) J. of the American Acad. Dermatology 25:751–760). Gross alteration in elastin leads to alterations in the appearance of the skin (see, Bryce et al. (1988) J. Invest. Dermatology 91:175–180; Kornberg et al. (1985) New Engl. J. Med. 312:771–774; Shelley et al. (1977) Br. J. Dermatol, 7:441–445). The association of changes in the fibers and the appearance of wrinkles indicate a causal relationship between the integrity of the elastic fiber network and the mechanical properties of the skin. Aging skin is characterized by initial elastogenesis followed by a slow spontaneous progressive degradation of the elastic fibers that leads to laxity and wrinkling. Studies of skin from subjects of various ages indicate that the degradation of elastic fibers that begins about age 30 and becomes marked after age 70 is a major feature of aging skin.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">In understanding the process of aging of human skin, it is pertinent to understand the role of fibroblasts, particularly in the dermis of human skin and in the corresponding connective tissue layer underlying the integuments of other mammals and the epithelia of the inner wall of the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals. Fibroblasts synthesize components that are required for maintenance of the structural, functional and cosmetic integrity of the skin and the structural and functional integrity of other surface tissues covered by epithelia. These components include collagen and elastin, which are fibrous proteins responsible for the three-dimensional architecture of skin and the other surface tissues, fibronectin, which is a protein responsible for cell anchorage and maintenance of cell morphology; and a number of proteinaceous growth factors essential for the maintenance of epithelia and basal cell layers and connective tissue layers underlying them. Available evidence indicates that protein biosynthetic activity of fibroblasts decreases significantly with age. For example, the rate of collagen synthesis at about 70% of life expectancy for human fibroblasts in culture is only about 50% of that of such fibroblasts at less than 20% of life expectancy.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">The changes in the appearance of the skin with age result from natural or intrinsic aging superimposed by actinic damage resulting from photoaging (see, e.g., Weiss et el. (1988) J. American Medical Assoc. 259:527–532). Intrinsic aging includes changes that occur as a result of endogenous factors and genetically programmed senescence, including epidermal and dermal atrophy. Photoaging results from long-term exposure to UV (ultra-violet) radiation, primarily from the sun. Ultraviolet exposure is also associated with tumor induction and other skin pathologies. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun includes UVB (280–315 nm) and the more penetrating UVA (315–400 nm) radiation. UVB causes erythema, skin cancer and dermal connective tissue damage. UVA also causes erythema and is carcinogenic at higher doses. Low doses (2.5 minimal erythemic doses (MEDs)) are sufficient to cause endothelial cell enlargement, extravasation of blood cells, and perivenular neutrophil infiltrates as wells increased concentrations of mediators of the inflammatory response (see, e.g., Kligman et al. (1985) J. Invest. Dermatol. 84:272–276).</p>
    <p num="p-0037">Long-term ultraviolet exposure results in histological and visible changes in the skin, including: damage to the underlying connective tissue, manifested as elastosis and increases in the glycosaminoglycans and loss of collagen; dermal accumulation of elastin-staining material resulting from the degenerative changes in collagen fibers; epidermal dysplasia with cytologic atypia and loss of polarity of keratinocytes; and an inflammatory infiltrate (see, e.g., Bissett et al. (1987) Photochemistry and Microbiology 46:367–378). The degradation of elastic fibers and wrinkling associated with intrinsically aging skin also accompanies photoaging. In humans, advanced photodamage can be detected in the staining properties of dermal tissue resulting from changes in the insoluble and soluble fractions of collagen that occur as the entire upper dermis becomes filled with elastosis (Kligman et al. (1989) J. Investigative Dermatol. 93:210–214). The changes in collagen and elastic fiber over decades of such exposure result in skin that is wrinkled, yellowed, blotchy, lax, rough and leathery. Scanning electron microscopy of aged skin indicates that the network of elastic fibers becomes denser and has a more disorganized arrangement than younger skin.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">Exposure to sunlight is such a pronounced factor in premature aging that by middle age individuals who have been exposed to more sunlight appear older than those who have not. The extent of dermal degenerative change correlates with the visible signs of premature aging. The subepidermal band of normal dermis, which is a site of continual dermal repair, contains normal collagen fibers. This zone becomes visually evident, however, only after there is sufficient elastotic damage to delineate this region. The elastotic material is composed principally of elastin and microfibrillar proteins that codistribute with fibronectin (see, Schwartz (1988) J. Invest. Dermatol. 1:158–161). Actinic elastosis appears to be reversible to some extent by treatment with chemical peels, dermabrasion or topical application of tretinoin (see, e.g., Warren et al. (1991) J. American Acad. Dermatol. 25:751–760; and Weiss et al. (1988) J. American Medical Assoc. 259:527–532).</p>

    <p num="p-0052">Gibberellins were first isolated by Japanese researchers in the 1930s from cultures of the fungus <i>Gibberella fujikuroi </i>(<i>Fusarium moniliforme</i>). These secondary metabolites have been shown to be present in other fungal species, in some ferns, and in many gymnosperms and angiosperms. Of the 121 known gibberellins, 96 have been identified only in higher plants, 12 are present only in Gibberella, and 12 are present in both. As in Gibberella, many different gibberellins can be present in individual angiosperms.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">Two main types of gibberellins exist: the C20-gibberellins, which have 20 carbon atoms (structure III, below), and the C19-gibberellins, in which the twentieth carbon atom has been lost due to metabolism (structure IV, below).

    <p num="p-0056">The ent-gibberellane ring system can contain many structural modifications, accounting for the large number of known gibberellins. Naturally occurring gibberellins with identified structures are allocated an “A number” (MacMillan et al. (1968) Nature 217:170–171). At present, 126 naturally occurring gibberellins of plant and fungal origin are known. Current structural information on gibberellins can be found at the website plant-hormones.bbsrc.ac.uk/gibberellin_information2.htm.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">Variations in gibberellin structure arise in several ways. Carbon-20 can exist in different oxidative states, e.g., methyl (—CH<sub>3</sub>), hydroxymethyl (—CH<sub>2</sub>OH), aldehyde (—CHO), or carboxylic acid (—COOH). The ent-gibberellane skeleton, especially that of the C19-gibberellins, can also contain additional functional groups. Hydroxyl (—OH) groups are frequently inserted into the ring system; insertion of epoxide (&gt;O) and ketone (═O) functions also occurs, although less commonly. The position and/or stereochemistry of substituent groups can affect the biochemical and physiological significance of the molecules. Substituent groups positioned above the ring plane are said to be in the β-configuration; their bonding to the ring is designated by a solid, elongated triangle. Substituent groups positioned below the ring plane are said to be in the α-configuration; their bonding to the ring is designated by a dashed, elongated triangle. The attachment of substituent groups in the plane of the ring system is indicated by a straight line.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">Gibberellins can exist as conjugates, for example with a molecule of glucose, either by an ether or an ester linkage. Such conjugation may temporarily or permanently inactivate a gibberellin.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">The biological activity of different gibberellins varies, and various gibberellins within a plant can be precursors, biosynthetic intermediates, or deactivation products of active gibberellins. Three structural features are commonly associated with gibberellin biological activity: a 3-hydroxyl group, a 7-carboxyl group, and a lactone ring. Broadly speaking, a compound possessing the ent-gibberellane ring system but lacking one or more of these structural features can be considered a gibberellin precursor, an intermediate, or a derivative.</p>

    <p num="h-0012">Effects of the Compositions on Keratinous Tissues</p>
    <p num="p-0103">The compositions and methods of the invention are useful for stimulating cellular proliferation and/or collagen production in cells within keratinous tissues. Such proliferation and collagen production can therapeutically improve visible and/or tactile discontinuities in mammalian skin, including discontinuities in skin texture and color. For example, after exposure to the compositions of the invention, the apparent diameter of pores can decrease, the apparent height of tissue immediately proximate to pore openings approaches that of the interadnexal skin, the skin tone/color becomes more uniform, and/or the length, depth, and/or other dimension of lines and/or wrinkles are decreased.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">The compositions of the present invention are also useful for regulating the condition of skin and especially for regulating keratinous tissue condition. Regulation of skin condition, namely mammalian and in particular human skin condition, is often required due to conditions that may be induced or caused by factors internal and/or external to the body. Examples include, environmental damage, radiation exposure (including ultraviolet radiation), chronological aging, menopausal status (e.g., post-menopausal changes in skin), stress, diseases, etc. For instance, “regulating skin condition” includes prophylactically regulating and/or therapeutically regulating skin condition, and may involve one or more of the following benefits: thickening of skin (i.e., building the epidermis, dermis, sub-dermal, subcutaneous fat, or underlying muscle layers of the skin) and, where applicable the keratinous layers of the nail and hair shaft, to reduce skin atrophy. The compositions and methods of the invention can also increase the convolution of the dermal-epidermal border (also known as the rete ridges), prevent loss of skin elasticity resulting from loss, damage and/or inactivation of functional skin elastin, prevent such as elastosis, sagging, loss of skin recoil from deformation; non-melanin skin discoloration such as under eye circles, blotching (e.g., uneven red coloration due to, e.g., rosacea) (hereinafter referred to as “red blotchiness”), sallowness (pale color), discoloration caused by telangiectasia or spider vessels.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">As used herein, prophylactically regulating skin condition includes delaying, minimizing and/or preventing visible and/or tactile discontinuities in skin (e.g., texture irregularities in the skin which may be detected visually or by feel).</p>
    <p num="p-0106">As used herein, therapeutically regulating skin condition includes ameliorating, e.g., diminishing, minimizing and/or effacing, discontinuities in skin.</p>
    <p num="h-0013">Dental Applications</p>
    <p num="p-0107">The invention also contemplates compositions for stimulating cellular proliferation of gum tissues. Such compositions and formulations are useful for treating or preventing a variety of dental and oral conditions, including gum recession, gingivitis and gum disease. These compositions can contain an effective amount of a hydroxy acid compound, a jasmonic acid compound, a gibberellic acid compound or a zeatin compound as well as an orally acceptable carrier and other ingredients. Such compositions can be formulated as mouthwashes, as a gel for use in a dental tray that can cup the teeth or as a adhesive that can stick to tooth or gum surfaces.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">In some embodiments, the carrier will include a tackifying agent and a solvent, which together yield a sticky matrix material. The matrix material can be sufficiently sticky to enable a dental tray to be held and retained against a person's teeth. Suitable sticky matrix materials are preferably viscous and do not readily dissolve in saliva. Various tackifying agents are available and the selection of the tackifying agent can readily be made by one of skill in the art. One tackifying agent that can be used to form a sticky and viscous matrix material comprises carboxypolymethylene, for example, CARBOPOL 934P. Carboxypolymethylene can be used to form a glue-like dental composition that itself can act as an adhesive in holding a comfortable, non-self-retaining dental tray against a person's teeth. The use of carboxypolymethylene eliminates the need to use dental trays that are self-retaining (i e., typically trays that are rigid and which mechanically interlock over a person's teeth or gums and which are intended for use with less sticky compositions). See U.S. Pat. No. 6,309,625.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">In general, the dental compositions of the present invention can include carboxy-polymethylene in a concentration in a range from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the dental composition, or in a range from about 2% to about 12% and or in a range from about 3% to about 10%. Where is it desired to increase the stickiness, viscosity and resistance to dilution to saliva, one may adjust the concentration of carboxypolymethylene to achieve a desired level of any or all of these properties. Increased stickiness assists in retaining the preferred dental trays against a person's teeth. Alternatively, compositions can be made less adhesive and tacky if desired, particularly is applied directly without a dental tray.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">In order to obtain good dispersion of the carboxypolymethylene resin within the dental composition, it is recommended that the carboxypolymethylene be mixed with a suitable solvent before attempting to add other components that are less compatible with carboxypolymethylene, such as water. Examples of suitable solvents for use with carboxypolymethylene include glycerin, other polyhydric alcohols, polyalkylene glycols and other polyols, and the like. Glycerin appears to enable larger quantities of carboxypolymethylene to be dispersed in water. It is preferable that the concentration of glycerin, polyol, or like substance utilized as a solvent in the dental whitening compositions be added in a range from about 15% to about 85% by weight of the dental whitening compositions, more preferably in a range from about 25% to about 75% by weight, and most preferably in a range from about 30% to about 65% by weight. It should be understood, however, that the actual amount of carboxypolymethylene is not critical for obtaining a sticky, viscous dental composition.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">The sticky matrix material may include other tackifying components that in combination with, or in lieu of some or all of, the carboxypolymethylene will yield a gum stimulating composition having the desired level of stickiness needed to hold a preferred, comfortable-fitting dental tray in place over a person's teeth. Other synthetic polymers and/or natural gums, proteins, or other gel-forming admixtures can be used so long as they yield a sticky gum stimulating composition.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">In addition to carboxypolymethylene, examples of other suitable tackifying and thickening agents include gums such as xanthan gum, talha gum, tragacanth gum, locust bean gum, guar gum, Irish moss gum, ghatti gum, furcelleran gum, carrageenan gum, arabic gum, alginic acid gum, agar gum, alginate gum. Another suitable tackifying agent is sold as PEMULEN™, a proprietary compound from B. F. Goodrich, or a compositional or chemical equivalent thereof. PEMULEN™ includes a significant quantity of a polyacrylic copolymer that has a slightly hydrophobic end and a strongly hydrophilic end. Additional examples of suitable tackifying agents include polyethylene oxides such as POLYOX™ sold by Union Carbide. These tackifying agents may be present in the same ranges as discussed above in relation to carboxypolymethylene.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">One of skill in the art may include other active dental agents to treat or prevent other types of dental and/or gum problems. For example, in conjunction with the gum-stimulating components of the invention, such a skilled artisan may provide anti-cariogenic and anti-demineralizing agents such as fluoride salts, more particularly sodium monofluorophosphate, sodium fluoride, and stannous fluoride. Depending on the level of fluoride treatment desired, and depending on whether or not a composition is “over-the-counter” or “by prescription”, the fluoride will be included in a range from about 0% to about 1% by weight of the dental whitening composition, more preferably in a range from about 0.1% to about 0.5% by weight. Antimicrobial agents, e.g., for fighting gum disease, may be included in conjunction with the gum stimulating components of the invention. Examples of useful antimicrobial agents include chlorohexidine, tetracycline, cetyl pyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetyl pyridinium bromide, methyl benzoate, and propyl benzoate. The antimicrobial agents are preferably included in an amount in a range from about 0% to about 15% with the gum stimulating, or in a range from about 1% to about 5% by weight.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">One method of dispensing sticky and viscous gum stimulating compositions within the scope of the present invention is by means of a syringe. Squeezable tubes and other similar dispensing devices may also be used to dispense the compositions. Upon dispensing, the gum stimulating compositions are sufficiently viscous that they do not easily settle or spread once dispensed, but will generally remain as a single extruded strand or bead of gum stimulating composition, for example, along the gum line. Moreover, bottles, tubes or other dispensing means known in the art may be used, particularly where the gum stimulating composition has lower viscosity, low stickiness, and does not include a thickening agent.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">In some embodiments, the invention provides a unit dose of the gum stimulating compositions in a syringe or similar dispensing device. In this way, the person can load the precise amount of gum stimulating composition onto the dental tray for each treatment period. By using such dispensing devices, the dentist is also able to monitor how many doses the person has received and used. In other embodiments, however, the gum stimulating compositions can be applied directly to the person's teeth without a dental tray, or a less viscous and sticky stimulating composition according to the invention may be used in conjunction with self-retaining trays known in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">While a given gum stimulating composition may be able to retain the dental tray against a person's teeth for, e.g., 10 hours or more, that composition could certainly be used within the scope of the present invention for any desired time period, such as for 15 minutes, one hour, or any desired time duration. In order to maximize treatment time and reduce the inconvenience of having a dental tray lodged within a person's mouth the dental trays can be used at night during a person's sleep.</p>
    <p num="h-0014">Additional Ingredients</p>
    <p num="p-0117">The compositions of the present invention may contain one or more additional skin care or gum care active ingredients.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">In general, the additional components should be suitable for application to keratinous tissue, particularly when the composition is to be in contact with human keratinous tissue. Hence, the additional ingredients incorporated into the composition are suitable for contact with human keratinous tissue and do out have undue toxicity, incompatibility, instability, allergic response, and the like within the scope of sound medical judgment.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">The CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook, Second Edition (1992) describes a wide variety of nonlimiting cosmetic and pharmaceutical ingredients commonly used in the skin care industry, which are suitable for use in the compositions of the present invention. Examples of these ingredient classes include: abrasives, absorbents, aesthetic components such as fragrances, pigments, colorings/colorants, essential oils, skin sensates, astringents (clove oil, menthol, camphor, eucalyptus oil, eugenol, menthyl lactate, witch hazel distillate), anti-acne agents, anti-caking agents, antifoaming agents, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, binders, biological additives, buffering agents, bulking agents, chelating agents, chemical additives, colorants, cosmetic astringents, cosmetic biocides, denaturants, drug astringents, external analgesics, film formers, opacifying agents, pH adjusters, propellants; reducing agents, sequestrants, skin bleaching and lightening agents (e.g., hydroquinone, kojic acid, ascorbic acid, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl glucosamine), skin-conditioning agents (e.g., humectants, including miscellaneous and occlusive), skin soothing and/or healing agents (e.g., panthenol and panthenol derivatives), aloe vera, pantothenic acid, pantothenic acid derivatives, allantoin, bisabolol, and dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, skin treating agents, thickeners, and vitamins and derivatives thereof.</p>

    <p num="h-0035">Composition Preparation</p>
    <p num="p-0191">The compositions useful for the methods of the present invention are generally prepared by conventional methods such as are known in the art of making topical compositions. Such methods typically involve mixing of the ingredients in one or more steps to a relatively uniform state, with or without heating, cooling, application of vacuum, and the like.</p>
    <p num="h-0036">Methods for Regulating Skin Condition</p>
    <p num="p-0192">The compositions of the present invention are useful for stimulating cellular growth and/or collagen production in keratinous tissues. Such increased cell growth and/or increased collagen production can help regulate or rejuvenate mammalian keratinous tissues. The compositions of the invention can be used for both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of skin conditions. For example, compositions of the invention can be used for wound healing, thickening keratinous tissue (i.e., building the epidermis and/or dermis layers of the skin and where applicable the keratinous layers of the nail and hair shaft), preventing and/or retarding atrophy of mammalian skin, preventing and/or retarding the appearance of spider vessels and/or red blotchiness on mammalian skin, preventing and/or retarding the appearance of dark circles under the eye of a mammal, preventing and/or retarding sallow-colored mammalian skin, preventing and/or retarding sagging of mammalian skin, softening and/or smoothing lips, hair and nails of a mammal, preventing and/or relieving itch of mammalian skin, regulating skin texture (e.g. wrinkles and fine lines), and improving skin color (e.g. redness, freckles).</p>
    <p num="p-0193">Treating keratinous tissues involves topically applying to the keratinous tissue a safe and effective amount of a composition of the present invention. The amount of the composition that is applied, the frequency of application and the period of use will vary widely depending upon the level of the acetylsalicylic acid, gibberellic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, or zeatin in a given composition and the level of regulation desired, for example, in light of the level of keratinous tissue damage present or expected to occur.</p>
    <p num="p-0194">In some embodiments, the composition is chronically applied to the skin. By “chronic topical application” is meant continued topical application of the composition over an extended period during the subject's lifetime, for example, for a period of at least about one week, or for a period of at least about one month, or for at least about three months, or for at least about six months, or for at least about one year. While benefits are obtainable after various periods of use (e.g., five, ten or twenty years), chronic application can continue throughout the subject's lifetime. Typically applications would be on the order of about once per day over such extended periods, however application rates can vary from about once per week up to about three times per day or more.</p>
    <p num="p-0195">A wide range of quantities of the compositions of the present invention can be employed to provide a skin appearance and/or feel benefit. Quantities of the present compositions that are typically applied per application are, in mg composition/cm<sup>2 </sup>skin, from about 0.01 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 10 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. A particularly useful application amount is about 1 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p num="p-0196">Regulating keratinous tissue condition can be practiced by applying a composition in the form of a skin lotion, cream, gel, foam, ointment, paste, emulsion, spray, conditioner, tonic, cosmetic, lipstick, foundation, nail polish, after-shave, or the like that is preferably intended to be left on the skin or other keratin structure for some esthetic, prophylactic, therapeutic or other benefit (i.e., a “leave-on” composition). After applying the composition to the skin, it can be left on the skin for a period of at least about 15 minutes, or at least about 30 minutes, or at least about 1 hour, or for at least several hours, for example, up to about 12 hours.</p>
    <p num="p-0197">Any part of the external portion of the face, hair, and/or nails can be treated, e.g., face, lips, under-eye area; eyelids, scalp, neck, torso, arms, hands, legs, feet, fingernails, toenails, scalp hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, etc. The composition can be applied with the fingers or with an implement or device (e.g., pad, cotton ball, applicator pen, spray applicator, and the like).</p>
    <p num="p-0198">Another approach to ensure a continuous exposure of the skin to at least a minimum level of the beneficial compositions of the invention is to apply the composition in a patch, for example, to selected tissues such as the face. Such an approach is particularly useful for problem skin areas needing more intensive treatment (e.g., a wound, facial crows feet area, frown lines, under eye area, and the like). The patch can be occlusive, semi-occlusive or non-occlusive and can be adhesive or non-adhesive. The composition can be contained within the patch or be applied to the skin prior to application of the patch. The patch can also include additional compounds such as chemical initiators for exothermic reactions such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,250, 5,981,547, and 5,972,957 to Wu, et al. The patch is preferably left on the skin for a period of at least about 5 minutes, or at least about 15 minutes, or at least about 30 minutes, or at least about 1 hour, or at night as a form of night therapy.</p>

    <heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading> <heading>Stimulation of Fibroblast Growth</heading> <p num="p-0200">This Example provides data showing the cell proliferating effect of acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid on human skin fibroblasts.</p>
    <p num="h-0039">Materials and Methods</p>
    <p num="p-0201">A human skin fibroblast cell line (Clonetics, Walkersville, Md., normal human dermal fibroblasts, neonatal) was tested to ascertain whether exposure to acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid of the invention would stimulate cellular proliferation. The proliferative response of the human skin fibroblast cell line to acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid was measured in a 96-well assay system using serum-free medium as a control. Both compounds were tested at three concentrations, 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>M, 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>M and 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>M. Cells (2×10<sup>3</sup>) were seeded into a 96 well in 100 μl of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). The plate was incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. After incubation, the medium was aspirated and the wells were rinsed twice with 100 μl of serum-free DMEM. The final rinse was aspirated and 100 μl of the 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>M, 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>M or 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>M solutions of acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid each were added to 5 wells. In addition, 100 μl of vehicle (serum-free DMEM) was added to 5 wells as control. All wells were incubated for 28 hours at 37° C. in a humidified, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. After incubation, 20 μl of Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution (Promega, Madison, Wis.) was added to all wells. The plate was swirled gently and placed back in the incubator for 45 minutes and spectrophotometric absorbance was read at 490 nm.</p>

    <p num="p-0208">A human skin keratinocyte cell line from Clonetics (Walkersville, Md., normal human epidermal keratinocytes, neonatal, catalog number cc-2503) was exposed to the jasmonic acid, zeatin and gibberellic acid (from Sigma Chemical Co.) to determine their effect on proliferation of keratinocytes. The proliferative response of these human skin keratinocytes to the test compounds was measured in a 96-well assay system using keratinocyte basal medium (KBM, Clonetics, catalog number CC-3103) as a control. All compounds were tested at three concentrations, 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>M, 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>M and 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>M. Cells were seeded into a 96 well plate at a concentration of 2×10<sup>3 </sup>cells in 100 μl of KBM. The plate was incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. After incubation, 100 μl of the 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>M, 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>M or 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>M solutions of jasmonic acid, zeatin and gibberellic acid were added to 5 wells each. In addition, 100 μl of vehicle KBM was added to 5 wells as control. The plate was incubated for 48 hours at 37° C. in a humidified, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. After incubation, 20 μl of Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution (Promega, Madison, Wis.) was added to all wells. The plate was swirled gently and placed back in the incubator for 3 hours. The spectrophotometric absorbance of each well was read at 490 nm.</p>

The cells were first grown in a 96-well assay system using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) both purchased from Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, Mo. Serum-free DMEM was used as a control. All compounds were tested at three concentrations 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>M, 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>M and 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>M. Cells were seeded into a 96 well plate at a concentration of 5×10<sup>3 </sup>cells in 100 μl of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). Plate was incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. After incubation, the medium was aspirated and the wells were rinsed twice with 100 μl of serum-free DMEM. The final rinse was aspirated and 100 μl of the 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>M, 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>M or 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>M solutions of the test compounds were added to the wells (n=2 for each concentration). In addition, 100 μl of vehicle (serum-free DMEM) was added to 4 wells as control. The plate was incubated for 48 hours at 37° C. in a humidified, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere.</p>
    <p num="p-0218">The assay was done by using the recommended 20 μl of the supernatant from each well of the 96-well plate. Standard buffer and stop solutions were freshly prepared before running the assay. 100 μl of antibody-POD conjugate solution (supplied with the kit) was added into the wells using pre antibody coated 96 well plate (supplied with the kit). 20 μl of standard and test solutions (from the other 96-well plate containing fibroblasts) were added to appropriate wells. Plate was mixed gently, sealed and incubated for three hrs. at 37° C.</p>
    <p num="p-0219">After incubation each well was washed carefully four times with PBS buffer (400 μl). All the wells were completely emptied at the end of washing from any liquid.</p>
    <p num="p-0220">100 μl of substrate solution (hydrogen peroxide and tetramethylbenzidine in a buffer solution, supplied with the kit) was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 15 minutes. At this point 100 μl of stop solution (freshly prepared 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) was added to each well in the same order as substrate. The plate was gently mixed and absorbance was read at 450 nm.</p>
    <p num="p-0221">Statistical analyses of data were performed using one-way ANOVA. P&lt;0.05 is considered significant, while P&lt;0.0001 is considered extremely significant and P&lt;0.001 is considered as very, very significant.</p>
    <heading>Results</heading> <p num="p-0222">Table 6 and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrate the collagen production of human fibroblast cells exposed to varying concentrations of jasmonic acid, gibberellic acid or t-zeatin. The concentration of jasmonic acid varied between 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>M (designated JA4), 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>M (designated JA5) and 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>M (designated JA6). The concentration of gibberellic acid varied between 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>M (designated GA4), 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>M (designated GA5) and 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>M (designated GA6). The concentration of zeatin varied between 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>M (designated ZA4), 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>M (designated ZA5) and 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>M (designated ZA6).</p>

The data provided in Table 6 and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> indicate that jasmonic acid, giberrellic acid and zeatin can all stimulate collagen production in human fibroblasts. The effect of gibberellic acid on collagen production was more profound, particularly at lower, rather than higher, concentrations. However, jasmonic acid strongly stimulated collagen production at higher concentrations and zeatin strongly stimulated collagen production at medium concentrations (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).
