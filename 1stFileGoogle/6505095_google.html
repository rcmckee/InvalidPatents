    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to a system that is scalable and configurable to include vending equipment audit capabilities, a card reader assembly having a card reader processor interface board for accepting card identification data as payment for items vended, an interactive interface, and protocol for interconnecting the system to a computing platform, and support for a plurality of communication options that include wired, point-to-point wireless, and wireless wide area networked (WAN) solutions. In addition, the present invention also relates to a system and method of effectuating a payment device for accepting card ID data, authorizing the validity of the card ID data, facilitating a vending transaction, settling the transaction to effect payment for the vended goods and services, gathering DEX and MDB audit data from the vending equipment, and data communicating with a plurality of remote locations.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Recent trends in the vending industry have been to offer higher priced items out of vending equipment at traditionally unattended vending location. Higher priced item offers can result from the desire to vend larger portions of products such as the twenty-ounce soda bottle verse the twelve-ounce soda can. In other cases the higher priced items can be items that until recently may not have been considered for sale through vending equipment such as phone cards, disposable cameras, and frozen food entrees to name a few.</p>
    <p>The vending industry's desire to vend higher priced items has given rise to issues related to currency and inventory. For example, with the shift to vending twenty-ounce bottles many of the vending sales now involve more that one currency note, as an example two one-dollar bills to make a purchase. As a result the bill validator can fill to capacity with currency notes before all the items in the vending equipment have been sold. With a bill acceptor filled to capacity the vending equipment may not be able to transact another vending sale and place itself out-of-service. As a result vending operators can typically find themselves restocking vending equipment that still has product available for sale but because of the inability to take additional currency notes the vending equipment could not sell the inventory.</p>
    <p>In addition, with many beverage type vending machines the shift from the twelve-ounce can to the twenty-ounce bottle created coin mechanism issues. In moving to the larger size beverage the average price can move from typically slightly less than a dollar where little change was required when a dollar note was used for payment to slightly more than a dollar where the better part of a dollar in change can be required when two one-dollar notes are used for payment for a vend. Resultant from this price move not only do the bill validators fill to capacity faster and stop working sooner, but the coin mechanism can be required to supply a customer with more change on each vend depleting a coin mechanism coin supply faster. Once the coin change supply is depleted the vending machine may be rendered out-of-service.</p>
    <p>In addition to the new burden on bill acceptors and coin mechanism resultant from the sale of higher priced items other issues related to the vending of higher priced items can arise. Once such issue can be that a customer may not have enough money on-hand to effectuate the vending purchase. In the case of phone cards, cameras, and frozen food vend prices may range from several dollars to forty dollars, fifty dollars, or more. In many cases the customer may have the desire to purchase the high priced item but simply lacks the amount of currency required to effectuate the purchase. In other cases the customer may be reluctant to trust the vend worthiness of the vending equipment with what the customer considers to be a significant amount of money.</p>
    <p>As the proliferation of higher priced vend items continues to become more pervasive in today's society the vending industry has become increasingly concerned about tracking inventory and the operational status of the vending equipment remotely. It is considered a general belief within the vending industry that remotely monitoring vending equipment can optimize a route driver's daily activity and reduce operational costs associated with the sales and delivery of products to the vending equipment.</p>
    <p>To date auditing devices have been designed to be placed inside the vending equipment or held in the hand of a route collector for the purpose of gathering vending equipment inventory and operational data which can later be downloaded to a computer. These devices however have been costly to manufacture, install, maintain, and operate. As such the total cost of the technology verse the savings on the operational costs associated with the sales and delivery of products to date have not made for a sound or compelling business model. As a result the vending industry has been slow to adopt ‘audit’ only technology.</p>
    <p>The cost benefit model of the ‘audit’ hardware may not be the only issue hampering the proliferation of ‘audit’ only device. Data communication costs, the costs of getting the data back to a central computer center can be a significant limitation on getting vending equipment remotely ‘audit’ capable or as it is commonly referred to in the vending industry as ‘online’.</p>
    <p>Such telecommunication costs can include the cost of running a telephone line to the vending equipment. In many cases the vending equipment may be in a location not conducive to having a dedicated phone line installed proximate to the vending equipment, such as in a concrete basement, on a golf course, in a shopping mall, or on a university campus to name a few. Once a telephone line is installed there can be monthly service charges incurred from the telecommunication company providing the service. These costs alone can in effect nullify the savings of having the vending equipment ‘online’.</p>
    <p>To avoid the high expense of running dedicated telephone lines to vending equipment the vending industry has pursued wireless wide area network (WAN) options. Implementing a wireless WAN has typically involved purchasing additional wireless hardware, and trying to integrate the wireless hardware with the ‘audit’ hardware. If the integration effort was successfully the hardware, service and maintenance costs of the combined solution were typically significantly increased compared to the ‘audit’ device only solution costs. In addition, the service and maintenance required for the combined wireless system is typically different then the non-wireless ‘audit’ device only solution.</p>
    <p>In addition to the increased hardware costs for the wireless WAN solution, the wireless communication service fees paid to the wireless network provider can be more then those fees charged by the communication companies providing telephone line service. A technology solution and service fee structure that could effectively nullify the anticipated sales and delivery savings from having the vending equipment ‘online’.</p>
    <p>In part a long felt need for a solution related to a cost effective system and method for remotely auditing vending equipment, and for providing additional payment options at the point of sale for goods and services vended from vending equipment, coupled with the industries short coming in these areas, some of which were mentioned above give rise to the present invention.</p>

    <heading>MDB Controller/G<b>4</b> E-port/E-port (System <b>500</b>) Interface Protocol And Specification</heading> <p>MDB Controller/G<b>4</b>:</p>
    <p>The MDB controller is the microcontroller-based system, which can interfaces to the vending machines MDB interface and to a computing platform. Such computing platforms include E-port. Certain versions of the E-port may incorporate the MDB controller and computing platform into a single board solution. In such a case serial communications between the computing platform and the MDB microcontroller occur over the devices serial peripheral interface (SPI) or other similar or suitable communication interface.</p>
    <p>The G<b>4</b> (system <b>500</b>) version of E-port can utilize a single microcontroller to serve as an MDB controller as well as a cashless payment system platform. The G<b>4</b> device incorporates an RS232 serial interface by which other computing platforms can interface to and control the functionality of the G<b>4</b> and associated vending equipment. The G<b>4</b> version can operate in two modes of operation. In a first mode of operation the G<b>4</b> provides all the MDB interface control, audit/cashless payment support, and network connectivity. In this mode a computing platform can interact with the G<b>4</b> in a hybrid role to monitor a string of user text prompts (see DISPLAY PROTOCOL) as well as execute NON-MDB-CONTROL types of commands (see table below).</p>
    <p>In a second mode of operation the G<b>4</b> can be configured and serve as an MDB controller (system <b>500</b>) only. In this mode both the MDB-CONTROL and NON-MDB-CONTROL commands can be executed. While in this mode of operation the computing platform operates as a master device controlling the operation and process now of the system. While in this mode the G<b>4</b> serves as a slave device interfacing to the vending machine and managing the control of the MDB interface.</p>
    <p>COMMUNICATION INTERFACE details the electrical interconnections required to allow the G<b>4</b> to data communicate with a computing platform.</p>
    <p>Communication Parameters:</p>
    <p>The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> communicates to a computing platform by way of serial communications. In this regard a set of commands issued from the computing platform implement a level of control via the MDB controller/G<b>4</b> and the MDB/ICP protocol to transact a cashless transaction and obtain DEX data information.</p>
    <p>Serial communications between the computing platform and the MDB controller/G<b>4</b> are set at 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, and 2 stop bits. Required serial port communications lines include transmit (Txd), Receive (Rxd) and Ground (Gnd).</p>
    <heading>MDB CONTROLLER/G<b>4</b> COMMAND PROTOCOL</heading> <p>Protocol Exchange:</p>
    <p>The “master” computing platform can initiate any ‘@’ command listed in the command tables below. In response to a complete command the MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will process and return the result string. The result string shall start with a start character (STX) hex $02, and conclude with an ETX character hex $03. A LRC check byte will immediately follow the ETX character.</p>

    <p>The ‘C’ flag is set when the MDB transaction string is cleared. The ‘$’ flag is set when a VEND CASH MDB transaction occurs. The ‘P’ flag is set when a VEND-APPROVED MDB command is issued and remains valid until the VEND SUCCESSFUL or VEND FAIL MDB command is issued. The ‘F’ flag is set when a VEND FAILS.</p>
    <p>Examples of MDB transaction strings:</p>
    <p>STX+[E0001500000000000C ]+ETX+LRC-&gt;Enabled, MAX Vend price $1.50, transaction string in cleared state</p>
    <p>STX+[S0001500000000000C]+ETX+LRC-&gt;In session, MAX Vend price $1.50, transaction string in cleared state</p>
    <p>STX+[V0001500001000002P]+ETX+LRC-&gt;Vend state, MAX Vend price $1.50, sale price $1.00, vend from column <b>2</b>, vend pending</p>
    <p>STX+[E0001500001000002V]+ETX+LRC-&gt;Enable state, MAX Vend price $1.50, sale price $1.00, vend from column <b>2</b>, vend complete</p>
    <p>STX+[E0001500001250003$]+ETX+LRC-&gt;Enable state, MAX Vend price $1.50, sale price $1.25, vend from column <b>3</b>, cash vend</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The MDB microcontroller/G<b>4</b> MDB interface will continuously manage the changes to the MDB transaction string. For example as the MDB state changes, the MDB state field will automatically be updated. There are however two scenarios that require the execution of the @&lt;esc&gt;C-CLEAR MDB TRANSACTION STRING DATA command. These two scenarios include when a currency vend has occurred the ‘F’ field has been set to ‘$’, and when a cashless vend has occurred and the ‘F’ field has been set to ‘V’. In both these cases the @&lt;esc&gt;C command will have to executed to clear the MDB TRANSACTION STRING before a new cash transaction can be tracked or a new cashless vending session can be started.</p>
    <p>If the G<b>4</b> is used in the VEND ACTIVE ‘ON’ mode the above does not apply in that the G<b>4</b> will clear the MDB TRANSACTION string as appropriate. If the G<b>4</b> is used in the G<b>4</b> VEND ACTIVE ‘OFF’ the above will apply.</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;C-CLEAR MDB TRANSACTION STRING DATA. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will clear the SALE PRICE field, COLUMN information field, and the transaction condition flag is set to ‘C’. The result string will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OK-C]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>&lt;esc&gt;H-HYBRID COMMAND FOR SEND CARD DATA AND MDB STRING. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will send both the card reader data (see @&lt;esc&gt;T above) followed by the MDB string (see @&lt;esc&gt;V). The result string will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[@&lt;esc&gt;T response]+ETX_LRC+STX+[@&lt;esc&gt;V RESPONSE]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;S-BEGIN A SESSION COMMAND. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will begin an MDB session (see NAMA MDB specification V1.0, V2.0 for BEGIN SESSION command). The result string will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OK-S]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>The G<b>4</b> must have the MDB state set to ‘E’ for ENABLED in order to start a session. If a session cannot be started the result string will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[UNABLE-S]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;X-END A SESSION COMMAND. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will END an MDB session (see NAMA MDB specification V1.0, V2.0 for SESSION CANCEL command). The result string will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OK-X]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;F-SET MDB CONTROLLER STATE TO INACTIVE. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will set the MDB state to Inactive. The result sting will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OK-F]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;D-SET MDB CONTROLLER STATE TO DISABLE. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will set the MDB state to Disable. The result sting will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OK-D]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;E-SET MDB CONTROLLER STATE TO ENABLE. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will set the MDB state to Enable. The result sting will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OK-E]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;K-PERFORM A HARDWARE MDB CONTROLLER RESET. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will return the result string and then go through a hardware reset. The result sting will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OK-K]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>&lt;esc&gt;I-TOGGLE INTERRUPT MODE. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will return the result string below toggling between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ of the interrupt mode.</p>
    <p>STX+[ON-I]+ETX+LRC-&gt;When toggling into the interrupt mode STX+[OFF-I]+ETX+LRC-&gt;When toggling out of the interrupt mode</p>
    <p>While in the interrupt mode the MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will send the result string for the @&lt;esc&gt;T and the @&lt;esc&gt;V commands shown above each time the respective data fields change.</p>
    <p>For example, while in the interrupt mode the MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will send the @&lt;esc&gt;T result string on the successful read of a magnetic card.</p>
    <p>In addition, while in the interrupt mode the MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will send the @&lt;esc&gt;V result string each time any field in the MDB transaction string changes.</p>
    <p>Default: The default condition on microcontroller reset is ‘OFF’.</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;<b>1</b>-TOGGLE MDB CODE CAPTURE MODE. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will return the result string below toggling between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ of the MDB CODE CAPTURE mode. This command is for diagnostic purposes only and should not be used during normal G<b>4</b> operation. The intended purpose for this command is to diagnosis MDB related transaction issues during development and or testing.</p>
    <p>STX+[ON-I]+ETX+LRC-&gt;When toggling into the MDB code capture mode.</p>
    <p>STX+[OFF-I]+ETX+LRC-&gt;When toggling out of the MDB code capture mode</p>
    <p>When the MDB code capture mode is switched to the ‘ON’ mode the following sequence of events begins:</p>
    <p>1. The NOVRAM memory dedicated to the storage of vending transaction is cleared. All data (transactions) currently being stored will be erased to make room for the MDB bus codes.</p>
    <p>2. The G<b>4</b> will begin record both the received MDB codes from the vending machine controller (VMC) and the sent MDB codes from the G<b>4</b>. There is RAM room for approximately 15 seconds of recording time.</p>
    <p>When the MDB code capture mode is switched to the ‘OFF’ mode the G<b>4</b> will stop recording the MDB bus codes. A buffer dump of the MDB codes exchanged between the G<b>4</b> and the VMC can be viewed by executing @&lt;esc&gt;<b>2</b> the MDB CAPTURED CODE BUFFER DUMP command.</p>
    <p>Two important notes:</p>
    <p>1. When you are ready to return the G<b>4</b> system to the normal operation mode you should 1) insure that the MDB CODE CAPTURE mode is ‘OFF’ and 2) Execute the @&lt;esc&gt;J CLEAR MAIN MEMORY command to clear and reset the G<b>4</b> main memory. The CLEAR MAIN MEMORY command is important in that the MDB codes captured are stored in the NOVRAM area and may interfere with the G<b>4</b> normal record management procedures.</p>
    <p>2. When the MDB capture mode is switched to ‘ON’ the G<b>4</b> will stay in this state until either 1) the buffer area for MDB codes if filled (about 15 seconds) or 2) the MDB capture mode is switched to ‘OFF’. Even if the G<b>4</b> is powered ‘OFF’ or the @&lt;esc&gt;K HARDWARE RESET command is issued the MDB capture mode state will not change. The reason for this is to allow the MDB capture mode to be turned ‘ON’ and remain ‘ON’ capturing MDB transaction codes between the vending machine and the G<b>4</b> while the vending machine and or G<b>4</b> go through a power up or reset procedure.</p>
    <p>If the G<b>4</b> is in a vending transaction the TOGGLE MDB CODE CAPTURE MODE command cannot be executed to turn ‘ON’ the MDB capture feature. If the TOGGLE MDB CODE CAPTURE MODE command is executed during a vending session the MDB capture mode will be turned ‘OFF’ and result string will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OFF-<b>1</b>]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>Default: The default condition on microcontroller reset is ‘OFF’</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;<b>2</b>-MDB CAPTURE MODE BUFFER DUMP. The MDB controller/G<b>4</b> will return the result string below dumping the MDB codes passed between the G<b>4</b> and the vending machine controller (VMC). The output will be formatted to indicate which codes were transmitted by the VMC and which codes were transmitted by the G<b>4</b>. This command is for diagnostic purposes only and should not be used during normal G<b>4</b> operation. The intended purpose for this command is to diagnosis MDB related transaction issues during development and or testing.</p>

    <p>Command Description:</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;$-SIMULATE CASH VEND TRANSACTION. The G<b>4</b> will simulate a CASH VEND transaction (see MDB spec V1.0 for CASH VEND command). The result sting will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OK-$]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>To simulate the CASH VEND the MDB transaction string will be set to the following:</p>
    <p>STX+[E0005000001250001$]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>If the G<b>4</b> is in a vending transaction a SIMULATE CASH VEND transaction cannot be executed. If a SIMULATE CASH VEND transaction cannot be executed the result string will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[UNABLE-$]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;#-SIMULATE CASHLESS VEND TRANSACTION. The G<b>4</b> will simulate a CURRENCY VEND transaction (see NAMA MDB spec V1.0 and V2.0 for VEND REQUEST and VEND APPROVED commands). The result sting will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[OK-#]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>To simulate the CASHLESS VEND the MDB transaction string will be set to the following:</p>
    <p>STX+[E0005000001250001V]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>If the G<b>4</b> is in not in a vending transaction a SIMULATE CASHLESS VEND transaction cannot be executed. If a SIMULATE CASHLESS VEND transaction cannot be executed the result string will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[UNABLE-#]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;M-TOGGLE MODEM COMMUNICATION ACCESS. The G<b>4</b> will switch the serial communication ports being utilized by the computing platform to the MDB controller/G<b>4</b> communication port. In this regard the computing platform can utilize the communication port (modem and or wireless) of the MDB controller/G<b>4</b>. The result sting will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[ON-M]+ETX+LRC-&gt;When toggling into the communication mode-allowing the computing platform to use the MDB controller/G<b>4</b> communication port. A communication hardware reset will also be invoked in the G<b>4</b> to prepare the communication device to receive data.</p>
    <p>STX+[OFF-M]-ETX+LRC-&gt;When toggling out of the communication mode</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The communication parameters between the G<b>4</b> are outlined in above as 9600, no parity, 8 data bits, and 2 stop bits. Upon executing the @&lt;esc&gt;M command ‘ON’ the G<b>4</b> switches direct access to the communication device. If for example, a 2400 baud modem is being used the device issuing the @&lt;esc&gt;M command will have to first change its baud rate to 2400 before the G<b>4</b> modem can respond to the requests. Furthermore, upon the conclusion of a communication session before the @&lt;esc&gt;M command can be issued and interrupted by the G<b>4</b> to switch the communications ‘OFF’ the baud rate of the device issuing the @&lt;esc&gt;M command should change its baud rate back to 9600 N, 8, 2.</p>
    <p>Default: The default condition on microcontroller reset is ‘OFF’</p>
    <p>@&lt;esc&gt;Q-SEND CURRENT TRANSACTION RECORD. The G<b>4</b> will return the current transaction record. The current transaction record is a fixed length record. The parsed fields are a list below. The result sting will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[RECORD NUMBER-TRANSACTION RECORD]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>If the G<b>4</b> is not in a vending transaction a SEND CURRENT TRANSACTION RECORD transaction cannot be executed. If a SEND CURRENT TRANSACTION RECORD transaction cannot be executed the result string will return:</p>
    <p>STX+[UNABLE-Q]+ETX+LRC</p>
    <p>Where the parsed [record number-transaction record] fields are as follows:</p>

Though the G<b>4</b> is only looking for a combination of three consecutive ‘A’'s sending more is preferred.</p>
    <heading>G<b>4</b> TEXT DISPLAY PROMPTS</heading> <p>Text Display Overview</p>
    <p>When the G<b>4</b> is in the VERBOSE ‘ON’ mode will send text messages out of the serial port to a display device. The display device can be the computing platform. The text messages correspond to the activity of the G<b>4</b>. For example, when the G<b>4</b> is ready to accept cards a text prompt message of ‘Please Swipe’, ‘A Valid Card’ may be displayed.</p>
    <p>To simplify the interface and functionality requirements of the computing platform the text prompts from tie G<b>4</b> can be captured and displayed on the computing platforms display. Doing so alleviates the need for the computing platform to ascertain and or determine what message should be displayed to the user. In addition, allowing the G<b>4</b> to manage the vending transaction, MDB interface, and text prompts removes the need for the computing platform to get involved in the vending transaction.</p>
    <p>The text format display protocol below illustrates how the G<b>4</b> sends text prompts. The selection of the control characters is consistent with the operating functionality of many text LCD displays.</p>
    <p>Communication Interface</p>
    <p>Shown below is an external view of the G<b>4</b>. The Display Port provides the interconnectivity to external devices and computing platforms for the purpose of control as outlined above and for display control as outlined in this section and its subsections.</p>
    <p>The Display Port is a DB-9 pin male connector. As shown below the port is a hybrid serial port with power tap for low current external devices.</p>

    <p>The communication pins Rxd, Txd, CTS, and RTS conform to RS232 standards. A minimum of Rxd, Txd, and GND are required to implement serial communication between the G<b>4</b> and a computing platform. The RTS and CTS lines only come into play from a flow control perspective when receipt data is being sent from the G<b>4</b>. CTS and RTS are implemented in such a way as to allow a receipt printer that has little to no printer buffer to control the flow of data. CTS and RTS have no other purpose in non-print data communications and can be ignored or left unimplemented.</p>
    <p>Display and Control Codes</p>
    <p>The G<b>4</b> will send a series of display and control codes to indicate when screen initializing and format could occur. In interpreting the display and control codes the computing device will know when to blank the display area and as appropriate when and where to locate cursor positions.</p>
    <p>The display and control codes are sent from the G<b>4</b> as a string of hex characters. The table of display control codes is as follows:</p>

    <p>Text Prompt Format</p>
    <p>The G<b>4</b> supplies text prompts in a fixed format. The format supports two lines of text each line being a maximum of 16 characters. The format includes a leading character, which indicates the line (line <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>) the text should be displayed on, up to 16 characters of text to be displayed, and a trailing character to indicate the end of the text message. When possible the text message should be formatted to contain 16 bytes. Leading spaces and trailing spaces can be us;ed to position the text message and format the text string to 16 bytes.</p>
    <p>The leading character conforms to the format supported by many text LCD display modules. The leading character will be a hex $80 to indicate the text message should be displayed on line <b>1</b> of the display area. A hex $C0 will indicate the text message should be displayed on line <b>2</b> of the display area.</p>
    <p>The trailing character will be a hex $F8. The trailing character indicates the end of the text message.</p>
    <p>Text message format:</p>
    <p>Lead Character=$80-Line <b>1</b> </p>
    <p>$C0-Line <b>2</b> </p>
    <p>Trailing Character=$F8</p>
    <p>[Lead Character]+[Up to 16 bytes of text message]+[Trailing Character]</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>$80+[ Swipe A Valid ]+$F8</p>
    <p>$C0+[ Credit Card ]+$F8</p>
    <p>The above will display ‘Swipe a Valid’ on line <b>1</b> of the display area, and ‘Credit Card’ on line <b>2</b> of the display area.</p>
    <p>Cursor Display Codes</p>
    <p>The G<b>4</b> uses a series of display codes to locate the position of the cursor. There are a maximum of 32 cursor positions-two rows of 16 characters. In addition there are cursor display codes to turn ‘ON’ a flashing cursor, turn ‘ON’ an underline cursor (show cursor), and to turn ‘OFF’ the cursor (hide cursor). The codes are similar to those used for typical text LCD displays.</p>
    <p>To locate the cursor in the display area the table below illustrates the hex code and corresponding cursor location.</p>

In an exemplary embodiment system <b>600</b> is manufactured onto the card reader and user interface board <b>312</b>. Furthermore, system <b>500</b> is manufactured into VIU <b>100</b>. The card reader assembly and optional printer assembly are then installed into vending equipment in such a way as to allow user access to the front faceplate <b>302</b> of the card reader assembly. Since in many cases there is little room in the vending equipment door area it is more convenient to mount the VIU <b>100</b> assembly in a different location within the vending equipment. In order to facilitate correct operation of the card reader assembly it must be electrically connected to the VIU <b>100</b>. To minimize the number of electrical connection to a single cable connected between the systems <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> a cable connection between interactive interfaces <b>532</b> and <b>614</b> can be implemented.</p>
    <p>To utilize a single data communication line (transmit line and receive line) a plurality of different types of data need to be combined into a single data stream.

    <p>Referring to FIG. 7 there is shown a transceiver and modem base unit system <b>700</b> and a plurality of remote locations <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>. One aspect of equipping vending equipment with a VIU <b>100</b> and or a card reader assembly and optional printer assembly is that the VIU <b>100</b> devices requires a data communication connection with a plurality of remote locations. In many vending equipment locations it can difficult to connect the VIU <b>100</b> to a physical communication line. When connecting the VIU <b>100</b> to a physical communication is difficult or undesirable the use of the transceiver and modem base unit <b>700</b> can be a better data communication option.

    <p>Referring to FIG. 8 there is shown an audit-credit-interactive system <b>500</b> interfaced to a computing platform. FIG. 8 illustrates how a audit-credit-interactive system <b>500</b> can be connected to a computing platform <b>802</b> by way of system <b>500</b>'s interactive interface <b>532</b> and computing platform <b>802</b> interactive interface. In similar form and function as <b>1</b>he interactive interface solution between system <b>500</b> and system <b>600</b> described above, system <b>500</b> and computing platform <b>802</b> can interconnect and data communicate as described with the communication specification and protocol shown in the table above.</p>
    <p>There can be at least two method of interconnecting a system <b>500</b>'s interactive interface <b>532</b> to a computing platform <b>802</b>. In the first method the system <b>500</b> and the computing platform <b>802</b> can be mutually exclusive devices that share a data cable connection between the interactive interfaces. In this regard the system <b>500</b> could be manufactured separate film the computing platform <b>802</b> and later during installation interconnected together with a data cable connection between the interactive interface ports.</p>
    <p>This method allows maximum flexibility in the selection of the computing platform <b>802</b>'s form and functional features as well as allowing maximum flexibility in the selection of the system <b>500</b>'s form and functional features.</p>
    <p>A second method of interconnecting a system <b>500</b>'s interactive interface <b>532</b> to a computing platform <b>802</b>'s interactive interface can be to integrate the system <b>500</b> and computing platform <b>802</b> into a single circuit design, preferably manufactured into a single circuit board device. In this regard the VIU <b>100</b> could comprise an integrated system <b>500</b> and computing platform <b>802</b> combined. This method of interconnectivity can be desirable, for example and not limitation, when mass-produced VIU <b>100</b>'s with a computing platform option is required, and where cost, unit size, and or ease of installation and service are considerations.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 9A there is shown a vending machine MULTI-DROP-BUS interface with a plurality of peripheral devices interconnected thereto. In typical vending equipment that operates with a VMC having a vending machine MDB interface <b>902</b> that supports the NAMA MDB specification, peripheral device can be interconnected to the vending equipment's common MDB bus. Once the peripherals are connected to the MDB bus the VMC is designated to operate as the master device and each of the peripheral devices are designated as slave peripheral devices. Such slave peripheral devices can include bill acceptor <b>904</b>, coin mechanism <b>906</b>, card reader <b>908</b>, and online module <b>910</b>. Bill acceptor <b>904</b> and coin mechanism <b>906</b> can be of a type for example and not limitation manufactured for or by MARS, COINCO, CONLUX, or other similar bill acceptor and coin mechanism type or manufacturer. Card reader <b>908</b> can be of a type for example and not limitation manufactured by or for USA TECHNOLOGIES, MARS, MARCONI, DEBITEK, SCHLUMBERGH, ACT, COINCO, or other similar card reader type. Online module can be of a type for example and not limitation manufacture for or by USA TECHNOLOGIES, MARCONI, MARS, COINCO, or other similar online module type.</p>
    <p>A limitation on peripheral devices can be that they must support a compatible version of the MDB protocol specification to operate correctly. This requirement of having to support the version of MDB protocol the VMC supports can limit the selection of compatible peripheral devices as well as limit the range of functionality of the peripheral devices.</p>
    <p>For example and not limitation if the VMC MDB protocol version does not support obtaining audit information from a peripheral device the audit information contained within the peripheral device will go unutilized. If in another example the bill acceptor is able to report it's functional operation information and the VMC does not support a MDB protocol version to obtain this information the data in the bill acceptor will not be retrieved and the benefits of having such informational data will not be realized.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9B illustrates how an audit-credit-interactive system <b>500</b> can be configured in series with the vending machine MDB interface <b>902</b>. In this regard the peripheral devices can be supported by the system <b>500</b>'s mimic MDB interface <b>516</b>. The advantage off this network configuration is that the system <b>500</b> can support multiple versions and derivative versions to the NAMA MDB protocol specification. Furthermore, the system <b>500</b> can provide peripheral message emulation and message passing to effectuate the VMC's ability to data communicate to each peripheral by way of the system <b>500</b>'s MDB interface <b>518</b> and mimic MDB interface <b>516</b>.</p>
    <p>In an exemplary embodiment the VMC can data communicate with each peripheral device at the MDB version level of the VMC. In addition, system <b>500</b> can data communicate with the VMC and each peripheral device at the VMC version level and each peripheral MDB version or derivative version level. In this regard features supported by a peripheral device's MDB version or derivative MDB version can be utilized. In addition, data communication between the system <b>500</b> and each peripheral device effectuates the ability to remotely monitor and manage each peripheral. In this type of peripheral support system <b>500</b> servers as a data communication gateway for each peripheral device. System <b>500</b> ability to data communicate with a plurality of remote location and with each peripheral device effectuates the ability of each peripheral device to data communicate with a plurality of remote locations.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 9B there is shown a system <b>500</b>'s MDB interface <b>518</b> interconnected with the VMC vending machine interface <b>902</b>. In this relationship the system <b>500</b> can support the version of MDB protocol that the VMC firmware supports. Each of the peripheral devices including bill acceptor <b>904</b>, coin mechanism <b>906</b>, card reader <b>908</b>, and online module <b>910</b> can then be interconnected with the system <b>500</b>'s mimic MDB interface <b>516</b>. In this regard the system <b>500</b> can support any number of NAMA MDB protocol versions and or derivative versions of the NAMA MDB protocol.</p>
    <p>For example and not limitation if the VMC supports NAMA MDB version 1.0 and an online module <b>910</b> supports a derivative version of the NAMA MDB protocol called advanced version 3.0 both the VMC and the online module <b>910</b> can be interconnect to a system <b>500</b> and operate correctly. In this relationship system <b>500</b> by way of MDB interface <b>518</b> and mimic MDB interface <b>516</b> data communicates with both the VMC and online module <b>910</b>. The system <b>500</b> interrupts and emulates the correct device protocols as to allow the VMC to data communicate with the online module <b>910</b>. In addition, the system <b>500</b> can data communicate with the online module for the purpose of effectuating MDB command messages not supported by the VMC's MDB version. The system <b>500</b> can then selectively data communicate, to a plurality of remote locations, data related to the peripheral devices including the online module <b>910</b>. Furthermore, by way of system <b>500</b> the peripheral devices interconnected with the system <b>500</b>'s mimic MDB bus <b>516</b> can data communicate with a plurality of remote locations.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 9C there is shown a audit-credit-interactive system <b>500</b> with card reader and audit functionality embodiment interfacing to a vending machine MDB bus and interfacing to a plurality of peripheral device by way of a audit-credit-interactive system <b>500</b> mimic MDB bus. In an exemplary embodiment system <b>500</b> combines the functionality of the card reader peripheral and audit or as it is commonly referred to as the online module or telemetry function thus eliminating the need for additional peripheral devices to provide these functions. In addition, the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b> can optional support peripheral device,s that are not compatible with the vending equipment's VMC.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9C illustrates that with a system <b>500</b> interconnected with the vending equipment's MDB interface <b>902</b> there is created two alternative bus configurations for the peripheral devices. For example and not limitation the bill acceptor <b>904</b>, coin mechanism <b>906</b>, as well as other types of peripheral devices can, based in part on MDB version compatibility, reside on either the vending equipment's MDB interface <b>902</b>, or the system <b>500</b>'s mimic MDB interface <b>516</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 10A there is shown an audit-credit-interactive system <b>500</b> embodied in a semiconductor package <b>1002</b>. In an exemplary embodiment a complete system <b>500</b> can be manufactured into a single semiconductor. This type of manufacture can have the advantage of small size and low cost. In addition, such a semiconductor version of an audit-credit-interactive system <b>500</b> can be advantageous when integration of system <b>500</b>'s functionality into other electronic devices is desirable.</p>
    <p>For example and not limitation a bill acceptor, a coin mechanism, or other type of electronic device can have a system <b>500</b> embedded into semiconductor <b>1002</b> designed into the peripheral device circuitry.

Other system <b>500</b> features can be included as may be required by the application. In addition, system <b>500</b> features shown within semiconductor package <b>1002</b> can be eliminated as may be required or desirable based on the application.</p>
    <p>Timekeeper <b>540</b> can be a real time clock (RTC) for keeping track of date and time functions. Flash interface <b>544</b> can be an interface to serial and or I<sup>2</sup>C electrical erasable read only memory (EEROM) or other flash memory types of devices.

NOVRAM <b>1004</b> can be of similar form and function as NOVRAM <b>512</b>.</p>
    <p>External interconnections to semiconductor <b>1002</b> can include card reader <b>1012</b>, display <b>606</b>, external peripheral <b>1016</b>, computing platform <b>802</b>, external flash <b>1006</b>, communication device <b>1008</b>, interface to vending equipment <b>1010</b>, and NOVRAM <b>1004</b>.</p>
    <p>Card reader <b>1012</b> can be an industry standard bit strobe, and serial style track <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> card readers. Such card readers include for example and not limitation those manufactured for or by XICO, NEURON, and MAGTEK.</p>
    <p>External peripheral <b>1016</b> can include RFID readers and writers, biometric devices, common communication ports such as RS232 and RS485, general purpose I/O, keypad, and or other types of peripheral device.

    <p>In an exemplary embodiment where possible software executing within semiconductor <b>1002</b> can emulate certain system <b>500</b> functionality to further reduce the dependence of physical hardware. For example and not limitation the card reader interface may be implemented in software where general purpose I/O lines could be configured to capture card data received from a card reader such as card reader <b>1012</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 10B the system <b>500</b> is embedded within semiconductor package <b>1002</b>. In this embodiment the system <b>500</b> relies on software executing in microcontroller <b>502</b> to implement and emulate the system <b>500</b>'s functionality.

The output voltage from power converter can be referred to a +VCC and can power the system <b>500</b> semiconductor <b>1002</b>.</p>
    <p>One advantage of allowing power convert <b>1020</b> to supply power to semiconductor <b>1002</b> can be that the semiconductor can be resident on an adapter card and retrofit to existing VMC's by connection to the VMC's MDB interface <b>902</b>. Through this single connection point the adapter card comprising the semiconductor <b>1002</b> can power itself and data communicate with the VMC by way of the VMC MDB interface <b>902</b>.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the semiconductor <b>1002</b> can be integrated into the VMC controller electronics and electrically connected on the circuit board to the VMC MDB interface <b>902</b>. Simplifying the data and power connections between semiconductor <b>1002</b> and the VMC can save time and effort in the integration of the combined VMC/system <b>500</b> solution. In addition, the fact that the system <b>500</b> can operate mutually exclusive from the VMC can be advantageous in the design of the overall combined VMC/system <b>500</b> solution.</p>
    <p>Besides combining the system <b>500</b> on a chip with a VMC control system the system <b>500</b> packaged in semiconductor <b>1002</b> can be integrated into a computing platform <b>802</b>. In this regard the semiconductor <b>1002</b> can be integrated into the computing platform <b>802</b> electronics and electrically connected by way external peripheral interface <b>536</b>. In addition, the fact that system <b>500</b> can operate mutually exclusive from the computing platform <b>802</b> can be advantageous in the design of the overall combined computing platform <b>802</b>/system <b>500</b> solution.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 11 there is shown an MDB initialization tuning routine <b>1100</b>. With the proliferation of different kinds and styles for vending equipment VMC controllers the NAMA MDB and NAMA derivative MDB protocol implementation can vary from VMC to VMC. One of tile most common variations can be interpretation of protocol command functionality, usage, and messaging formatting.</p>
    <p>Another source of VMC MDB protocol implementation variations can occur as a result of the VMC computing power and or microprocessor speed or (millions of instructions per second) MIPS capability. Microprocessor speed can influence MDB protocol implementation and message transaction speed in several ways. One such way can be in the MDB interface to the microprocessor.</p>
    <p>MDB message transactions are a string of serial bytes. As such bytes must arrive one at a time to the VMC microprocessor. Once a byte arrives it must be fetched from the VMC microprocessor receive buffer and processed. The time required to fetch a byte can vary from VMC to VMC. As such the inter-byte time spacing, which is the amount of time delay inserted between sent bytes could be a critical variable. If for example and not limitation a string of bytes arrive to close together, or in other words the inter-byte time spacing is too short the VMC may not be able to process the bytes and as a result the system <b>500</b> could fail to initialize and operate correctly. If for example and not limitation a string of bytes arrive to far apart, or in other words the inter-byte time spacing is too long the VMC may time-out and fail to process the MDB message. As a result the system <b>500</b> could fail to initialize and operate correctly.</p>
    <p>The MDB protocol involves a master-slave relationship between the master vending equipment's VMC and the slave peripheral devices. In implementing the MDB protocol the master VMC initiates an MDB message command to a slave peripheral device. The slave peripheral device then has a finite amount of time to respond to the VMC command message with a message response. As such the amount of time allotted for the peripheral device to respond with a MDB message response can vary from VMC to VMC. If for example and not limitation the peripheral device responds too quickly with a message response the VMC's microprocessor may not be ready and miss the return message. As a result the system <b>500</b> could fail to initialize and operate correctly. If for example and not limitation the peripheral device takes too much time to respond to the message the VMC may time-out waiting for the peripherals response message. As a result the system <b>500</b> could fail to initialize and operate correctly.</p>
    <p>The MDB initialization tuning routine <b>1100</b> determines through successive iterations of the MDB initialization sequence the optimum inter-byte spacing and message response timing. Processing begins in block <b>1102</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1102</b> the MDB inter-byte time spacing and the MDB response time are set to a minimum range setting. Processing then moves to block <b>1104</b>. Appropriate inter-byte time spacing can range from a minimum range of a few microseconds to a maximum range of a several milliseconds. Appropriate message response time also referred to as the response time can range from a minimum range of less than one millisecond to a maximum range of five to ten milliseconds.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1104</b> the system <b>500</b> waits for the VMC to initiate the POLL command. In response to the POLL command the system <b>500</b> sends the JUST RESET command. Processing then moves to block <b>1106</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1106</b> the system <b>500</b> responds to VMC MDB transaction messages with message responses in an attempt to initialize the system <b>500</b>. Processing then moves to decision block <b>1108</b>. Initialization of the system <b>500</b> occurs by a series of successful VMC and system <b>500</b> MDB transaction message exchanges. The system <b>500</b> can be considered successfully initialized when the VMC and the system <b>500</b> have exchanged configuration messages and the VMC has issued to the system <b>500</b> the MDB ENABLE message.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1108</b> a determination is made as to whether the system <b>500</b> received the MDB ENABLE command from the VMC and if the system <b>500</b>'s operation state is now enabled. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the system <b>500</b>'s operation is now ENABLED then the routine is exited. If the resultant is in the negative that is the system <b>500</b>'s operational state is not ENABLED then processing moves to block <b>1110</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1110</b> the inter-byte time spacing is incrementally increased and processing moves to decision block <b>1112</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1112</b> a determination is made as to whether the inter-byte time spacing maximum range has been reached. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the inter-byte time spacing maximum range has been reached then processing moves to block <b>1114</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the inter-byte time spacing maximum range has not been reached then processing moves to block <b>1116</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1114</b> the inter-byte time spacing is set to the initial minimum range setting. In addition, the message response time is incremented. Processing then moves to decision block <b>1118</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1118</b> a determination is made as to whether the message response time maximum range has been reached. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the maximum message response time range has been reached then processing moves to block <b>1116</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the maximum message response range has not been reached then processing moves back to block <b>1104</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1116</b> a prompt is provided that the MDB communications between the system <b>500</b> and the VMC could not be established. The routine is then exited.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 12 there is shown a VIU <b>100</b> with system <b>500</b> and transceiver and modem base unit system <b>700</b> wireless protocol data communication routine <b>1200</b>. In a typical application involving a VIU <b>100</b> comprising audit-credit-interactive system <b>500</b> the VIU <b>100</b> will be installed in vending equipment. In certain of those installations it may desirable to data communicate wirelessly to a transceiver system <b>700</b> instead of trying to hardware the system <b>500</b> to a communication line.</p>
    <p>In installations where system <b>500</b> data communicates to a plurality of remote locations by way of a wireless data connection to transceiver system <b>700</b> a protocol can be implemented to insure data integrity, security, and transceiver system <b>700</b> correct configurations. Routine <b>1200</b> can implement such a protocol between system <b>500</b> and transceiver system <b>700</b>. Processing begins in block <b>1202</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1202</b> the transceiver system <b>700</b> data communicates wirelessly an ENQ packet. Processing then moves to decision block <b>1204</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1204</b> a determination is made as to whether the system <b>500</b>, referred to as the terminal, wirelessly receives the ENQ message sent by the transceiver system <b>700</b>. If the result is in the affirmative that is the terminal receives the ENQ message then processing moves to block <b>1206</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the terminal did not receive the ENQ message then processing moves back to block <b>1202</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1206</b> the terminal is enabled for transaction processing. Processing then moves to block <b>1208</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1208</b> the transceiver system <b>700</b> referred to as the base unit transmits an ENQ packet with a packet ID attached. Processing then moves to block <b>1210</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1210</b> the terminal receives the ENQ and packet ID from the transceiver system <b>700</b>. In accordance with system <b>500</b> data requirements the system <b>500</b> then responds as necessary with a data packet. Processing then moves to block <b>1212</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1212</b> the transceiver system <b>700</b> upon receiving the data packet from the system <b>500</b> decodes the data packet. Processing then moves to decision block <b>1214</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1214</b> the transceiver system <b>700</b> makes a determination as to whether the data received from the system <b>500</b> is data intended for system <b>700</b> configurations. System <b>700</b> can be referred to as the base unit or base. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the data is configuration data for the base unit processing moves to block <b>1218</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the data is not configuration data for the base unit then processing moves to block <b>1216</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1216</b> the data received from the system <b>500</b> is data communicated or passed to the system <b>700</b>'s modem <b>704</b>. Processing then moves back to block <b>1208</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1218</b> a determination is made as to whether the data command received from the system <b>500</b> is a baud rate configuration command intended for modem <b>704</b> or a baud rate configuration command intended for transceiver <b>708</b>.</p>
    <p>In an exemplary embodiment modem <b>704</b> data communicates with microcontroller at a first baud rate to effectuate data communication with a plurality of remote locations. Transceiver <b>708</b> data communicates with microcontroller <b>502</b> by way of transceiver <b>524</b> at a second baud rate to effectuate data communications between system <b>500</b> and a plurality of remote locations by way of system <b>700</b>.</p>
    <p>If the resultant in decision block <b>1218</b> is in the affirmative that is the data command is a baud rate configuration command then processing moves to decision block <b>1220</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the data command received is not a baud rate configuration command then processing moves to decision block <b>1228</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1220</b> a determination is made as to whether the command is intended for modem <b>704</b>. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the command is intended for modem <b>704</b> then processing moves to block <b>1224</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the command is not intended for modem <b>704</b> then processing moves to block <b>1222</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1220</b> the transceiver <b>708</b> baud rate is configured. Processing moves to block <b>1226</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1224</b> the baud rate of modem <b>704</b> is configured. Processing moves to block <b>1226</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1226</b> the transceiver system <b>700</b> sends the acknowledge (ACK) message to the system <b>500</b> originating the data command. Processing then move backs to block <b>1208</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1228</b> a determination is made as to whether the received data command is a hardware-reset command. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the received data command is a hardware-reset command then processing moves to decision block <b>1230</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the received data command is not a hardware-reset command then processing moves to block <b>1234</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1230</b> a determination is made as to whether the received command is a modem hardware-reset command. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the received data command is a modem hardware-reset command then processing moves to block <b>1232</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the data command received is not a hardware-reset command then processing moves to block <b>1236</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1232</b> the transceiver system <b>700</b> sends the ACK message to the system <b>500</b> originating the date command. Processing then moves to block <b>1238</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1238</b> the microcontroller <b>702</b> is reset. The routine is then exited.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1236</b> the modem <b>704</b> is reset. Processing moves to block <b>1240</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1240</b> the transceiver system <b>700</b> sends the ACK message to the system <b>500</b> originating the data command. Processing then move back to block <b>1208</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1234</b> the transceiver system <b>700</b> sends the COMMAND NOT RECOGNIZED message to the system <b>500</b> originating the data command. Processing then move backs to block <b>1208</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 13 there is shown a local transaction authorization routine <b>1300</b>. A conventional card authorization through a remote processing bureau utilizing dial-up landline access to the remote processing bureau can take ten or more seconds to complete. In certain vending venues and or while vending certain type of products a ten or more second delay may be unacceptable. In these instances authorization routine <b>1300</b> can be implemented to reduce or eliminate the authorization delay while maintaining a high confidence that the card is valid. A card can be any form of ID including a credit card, private label card, smart card, hotel room card, RFID, biometric, and or other similar or suitable form of ID. Processing begins in decision block <b>1302</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1302</b> a determination is made as to whether the LOCAL AUTHORIZATION flag is set for this pass. In an exemplary embodiment system <b>500</b> can be programmed to locally authorize a card based in part on an iterative process, which allows for the local authorization routine to be invoked, at a minimum, on the first pass and subsequently at any successive pass, up to the last pass. The last pass is predetermined and is referred to as the MAXIMUM AUTHORIZATION ATTEMPTS.</p>
    <p>In a first example the local authorization can be invoked on the first pass. In this case no remote location will be contacted unless the local authorization results in a declined card response. In a second example the local authorization flag may be set for the second pass. In this case the system <b>500</b> will first try to remotely authorize the card. If the remote processing bureau is unavailable or unable to authorize the card then on the second pass the local authorization routine will be invoked.</p>
    <p>If the resultant in decision block <b>1302</b> is in the affirmative that is the LOCAL AUTHORIZATION flag is set then processing moves to decision block <b>1304</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the LOCAL AUTHORIZATION flag is not set then processing moves to block <b>1308</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1304</b> a determination is made as to whether the local authorization test was OK. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the local authorization test was OK then processing moves to decision block <b>1306</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the local authorization test failed then processing moves to block <b>1308</b>.</p>
    <p>In an exemplary embodiment the local authorization test can include a test of the cards expiration date and the cards module-<b>10</b> check digit. The test of the expiration date will determine whether or whether not the card is expired based on the current date. The test for the module-<b>10</b> check digit will determine if the card number sequence is a valid number sequence.</p>
    <p>In decision bloc <b>1306</b> a determination is made as to whether the CARD USAGE FREQUENCY limit has been reached. The CARD USAGE FREQUENCY is the total amount of time in a predetermined time period the current card has previously been authorized. In an exemplary embodiment the CARD USAGE FREQUENCY can be used to limit the number of times a card will be locally authorized before the system <b>500</b> will attempt to authorize the card by way of a processing bureau <b>804</b>.</p>
    <p>If the resultant in decision block <b>1306</b> is in the affirmative that is the CARD USAGE FREQUENCY is within the limit then processing moves to decision block <b>1310</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the CARD USAGE FREQUENCY has reached the limit then processing moves to block <b>1308</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1308</b> system <b>500</b> initiates a data communication for the purpose of authorizing the current card with the processing bureau <b>804</b>. Processing moves to block <b>1312</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1312</b> a local database within system <b>500</b> can be updated. This local data can include positive cards, which are cards that have previously been successfully approved. In addition, this local database can include negative cards, which are cards that have previously been declined. Processing then moves to decision block <b>1314</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1310</b> the card is tested for its appearance in the system <b>500</b> local databases. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the card does not appear in a negative database and or the card appears in the positive database then processing moves to block <b>1312</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the card appears in the negative database and or does not appear in the positive database then processing moves to block <b>1308</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1314</b> a determination is made as to whether the card has been approved. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the card has been approved then processing moves to block <b>1316</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the card has been declined than processing moves to decision block <b>1318</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1318</b> a determination is made as to whether the MAXIMUM AUTHORIZATION ATTEMPTS has been reached. The MAXIMUM AUTHORIZATION ATTEMPTS is the count of the number of iterative authorization passes through routine <b>1300</b>. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the MAXIMUM AUTHORIZATION ATTEMPTS has not been reached then processing moves back to decision block <b>1302</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the MAXIMUM AUTHORIZATION ATTEMPTS limit has been reached then the routine is exited the card is reported as declined.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1316</b> he transaction is reported as authorized and the vending equipment is enabled for operation. The routine is then exited.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 14 there is shown an international transaction authorization and settlement routine <b>1400</b>. Standard transaction processing fees for low cost sales can be significant. International card processing can incur even more transaction processing fees in the form of currency conversion fee. Currency conversion fees are fees incurred when currency is converted from one countries currency to another. To minimize the standard transaction processing fees and to minimize and or eliminate the currency conversion fees routine <b>1400</b> can be implemented. Processing begins in block <b>1402</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1402</b> the local authorization routine <b>1300</b> is executed. Processing moves to decision block <b>1404</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1404</b> a determination is made as to whether a remote data communication to a processing bureau <b>804</b> is required. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the local authorization is approved and a remote authorization is not required then processing moves to block <b>1408</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the local authorization was declined or failed and a remote data communication with processing bureau <b>804</b> is required then processing moves to block <b>1406</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1406</b> authorization through a network connection to a remote host network <b>808</b> and or processing bureau <b>804</b> is executed. Processing then moves to decision block <b>1418</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1418</b> a determination is made as to whether the remote authorization was approved. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the remote authorization was approved then processing moves to block <b>1408</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the remote authorization failed or was declined then the card is declined and the routine is exited.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1408</b> the vending equipment is enabled and vending can occur. Processing then moves to block <b>1410</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1410</b> a batch of locally authorized transactions is data communicated to a remote location (the remote location being another country) by way of a network connection. In this regard locally authorized transactions can be moved from the country in which the vending sale (occurred to the country where the transactions will be processed with a processing center. Processing then moves to block <b>1412</b>. The transfer of locally authorized transactions can occur at a predetermined time including hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other desirable time interval.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1412</b> the server receiving the locally authorized transactions from a plurality of remotely located system <b>500</b> authorizes and settles each locally authorized transaction. The process of settlement effectuates the transfer of fund from the cardholder to the merchant. In this regard the transaction is authorized and settled in the same country avoiding any currency conversion fee. Additionally, since transactions can be aggregated from a plurality of system <b>500</b> in a plurality of countries the transaction and currency volumes increase. These increases in transaction volumes coupled with efficient batching of transactions to the processing bureau can result in the lowest possible standard transaction processing fees. Processing then moves to block <b>1414</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1414</b> the funds generated from the authorization and settlement of the locally authorized transaction can be electronically transfer back to a bank in the country in which the vending sale occurred, or the country of choice. Such a transfer can be accomplished by an electronic funds transfer (EFT), or other similar or desirable method for transfer funds. The transfer of funds can occur at a predetermined time including hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other desirable time interval. Processing then moves to block <b>1416</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1416</b> reporting requirements can be effectuated as required and electronically transmitted to the appropriate parties. Such a reporting cycle can be referred to as a remittance cycle and can be utilized by all parties having involvement in the transactions to among other things verify fund transfers, and monitor vending equipment operational efficiencies. The remittance cycle can occur at a predetermined time including hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other desirable time interval. The routine is then exited.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 15 there is shown a data communication transaction message parsing routine <b>1500</b>. In an exemplary embodiment system <b>500</b> can generate data and transactions relating to vending equipment DEX data, vending equipment MDB data, vend transaction data, financial transaction data, system <b>500</b> diagnostic data, and other type of data and transactions. While a system <b>500</b> has data communication access to a remote host network center <b>808</b> the system <b>500</b> can data communicate the mixed batch or varying types and kinds of data to the host network center <b>808</b> servers. It is at the host network centers <b>808</b> that the data and transaction must be parsed and handled in different methods. Such parsing method can include forwarding data to a subsequent server, storing data in a database, data processing to produce a new result and then acting on the resultant data, storing and forwarding transaction data including card transaction data for authorization and settlement, as well as implementing other methods for handle mixed batch data parsing. Processing begins in block <b>1502</b> </p>
    <p>In block <b>1502</b> a host data connection is initiated and established between the system <b>500</b> and the host network center <b>808</b>. Such a data connection can be a dial-up connection, and Internet based connection, or other suitable data connections. Processing then moves to block <b>1504</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1504</b> the system <b>500</b> terminal configuration data is exchanged between the system <b>500</b> and the host network servers. This terminal configuration data effectuates the ability to remotely manage the terminal operational parameters including the terminals firmware version form a remote host network center <b>808</b>. Processing then moves to block <b>1506</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1506</b> the host network server receives a data stream from the system <b>500</b>. The data stream can comprise a mixed batch of operational data, marketing data, transaction data, and other types of data. Processing then moves to block <b>1508</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1508</b> the server implement a series of parsing methods to identify and separate the different kinds of data and transactional information. Processing then move to block <b>1510</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1510</b> the host network server stores the parsed data in a temporary data structure wherein each type and kind of data is uniquely identifiable. The data connection is terminated with the system <b>500</b> and the routine is exited.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 16A-B there is shown a determination of transaction completion routine <b>1600</b>. In an exemplary embodiment once a transaction has been authorized and approved vending begins. In many vending applications multi-vends per transaction may be desirable. Routine <b>1600</b> can implement a method of determining when to allow a user to make an additional purchase and when not to. Processing begins in block <b>1602</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1602</b> the transaction is authorized. Transaction authorization can occur as disclosed in routines <b>1300</b> and <b>1400</b>, or by other suitable methods. When a transaction has been approved and the vending equipment is being readied for vending, processing moves to block <b>1606</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1606</b> a MAXIMUM VEND ITEM LIMIT is determined and set. The MAXIMUM VEND ITEM LIMIT is the maximum number of items that can be vended on a single authorization. The MAXIMUM VEND ITEM LIMIT can be stored as part of the system <b>500</b>'s terminal configuration file and remotely managed by way of the remote host network center <b>808</b>. In an exemplary embodiment the MAXIMUM VEND ITEM LIMIT can range from one to ten items. Processing then moves to block <b>1610</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1610</b> the AUTHORIZED VALUE LIMIT is determined and set. The AUTHORIZED VALUE LIMIT is the maximum total sale amount a user has been authorized to purchase. The AUTHORIZED VALUE LIMIT can be stored as part of the system <b>500</b>'s terminal configuration file and remotely managed by way of the remote host network center <b>808</b>. Processing then moves to block <b>1604</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1604</b> the NO ACTIVITY TIMER LIMIT is determined and set. The NO ACTIVITY TIMER LIMIT is the maximum amount of time a user has to make the first vend. The NO ACTIVITY TIMER LIMIT can be stored as part of the system <b>500</b>'s terminal configuration file and remotely managed by way of the remote host network center <b>808</b>. In an exemplary embodiment the NO ACTIVITY TIMER LIMIT can range from less than one minute to several minutes. Processing then moves to block <b>1608</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1608</b> the RE-VEND TIMER LIMIT is determined and set. The RE-VEND TIMER LIMIT is the maximum amount of time a user has to make additional vends beyond the first vend. The RE-VEND TIMER LIMIT can be stored as part of the system <b>500</b>'s terminal configuration file and remotely managed by way of the remote host network center <b>808</b>.

    <p>In decision block <b>1644</b> a determination is made as to whether a VEND REQUEST MDB command has been received from the vending equipment's VMC. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the VEND REQUEST has been received then processing moves to block <b>1648</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the VEND REQUEST command was not received then processing moves back to decision block <b>1642</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1648</b> the VEND REQUEST command is processed and a VEND APPROVED or VEND DENIED response message is data communicated from the system <b>500</b> to the requesting VMC. Processing then moves to back to decision block <b>1632</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 17 there is shown a data communication sweeping, processing, and data forwarding routine <b>1700</b>. It an exemplary embodiment the host network center <b>808</b> accumulates a plurality of different kinds of parsed data transactions in a temporary data structure. Such a parsing and temporary data structure can be implemented as disclosed in routine <b>1500</b>. To move the data transactions from the temporary data structure a more permanent data structure and or host network sever routine <b>1700</b> can be implemented. Processing begins in block <b>1702</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1702</b> the transactions stored in the temporary data structure are swept into an operational database. Such an operational database can be implemented as a SQL database, ORACLE database, flat file database, DB<b>2</b> database, and or a combination of different kinds and types of databases. Processing then moves to block <b>1704</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1704</b> locally authorized transactions that have not been previously authorized are authorized with a processing bureau <b>804</b>. This authorization after the vending sale has occurred can be referred to as post authorization. Processing then moves to block <b>1706</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1706</b> any transactions including the previously posted authorized transactions are settled with the processing bureau <b>804</b>. The process of settlement effectuates the transfer of funds from the cardholder to the merchant. Settlement after the vending sale has occurred can be referred to as post settlement or post settle. Processing then moves to block <b>1708</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1708</b> any refund transactions generated by the host network center customer service are processed. Refund transactions can occur when a previously settled transaction requires some portion of the sale amount be refunded to the cardholder. Customer service can generate a refund transaction by querying from an operation database the original transaction and then initiate a refund transaction based in part on the queried customer's original transaction. Processing then moves to block <b>1710</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1710</b> data related to vending equipment DEX and MDB detail can be converted as required and data communicated to databases, and or other servers. The process of converting the DEX and MDB data can involve parsing and repackaging the data into a desired data warehousing interface format. Alternatively, the DEX and MDB data can be posted to a server where customers can by way of a network connection to the host network center <b>808</b> download the data.</p>
    <p>In addition to the convert and forward functionality the data handled can be measured and counted as desired for the purpose of billing for the service of gathering data from a remote system <b>500</b> and delivering the data to a customer's desired location. Measurement and counting can include for example and not limitation measuring file and or data size, measuring, the frequency the data is gathered, counting the number of times data is gathered and or forwarded, measuring access to the host network center <b>808</b>, or by other suitable measurement and counting method and or criteria. Processing moves to block <b>1712</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1712</b> the funds collected from the processing of transactions can be remitted to the customer as required by EFT or other desirable method. The funds remitted can have service fees deducted from them such that their EFT amount is less than the total processed transaction amount. In this regard customer will not have to be billed for services. The deducting of service fees from the flow of funds can eliminate the need to invoice a customer for service. The routine is then exited.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 18A-B there is shown a mimic MDB interface port routine <b>1800</b>. In an exemplary embodiment the system <b>500</b> can serve as a MDB protocol conversion gateway. In this regard the system <b>500</b> can emulate and interpolate VMC MDB messages for a plurality of peripheral device. In addition, the system <b>500</b> can act as a MDB master or MDB slave device allowing the system <b>500</b> to support peripheral devices the VMC cannot. Routine <b>1800</b> implements the system <b>500</b> functionality to support the MDB interface <b>518</b> and the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b>. Processing begins in block <b>1802</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1802</b> the VMC and system <b>500</b> exchange MDB message commands by way of the VMC MDB interface <b>902</b> and the system <b>500</b>'s MDB interface <b>518</b>. The system <b>500</b> can be referred to as terminal <b>500</b> or as the terminal. Processing moves to block <b>1804</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1804</b> the terminal <b>500</b> decodes the MDB command message. Processing moves to decision block <b>1806</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1806</b> a determination is made as to whether the MDB command message is a coin mechanism command message. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the MDB command message is a coin mechanism MDB command message then processing moves to block <b>1808</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is then MDB command message is riot a coin mechanism MDB command message then processing moves to decision block <b>1812</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1808</b> the MDB command message is encoded and forwarded or passed by way of the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b> to the coin mechanism. Processing then moves to block <b>1810</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1810</b> the system <b>500</b> by way of the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b> receives any response MDR message from the coin mechanism. As required the system <b>500</b> decodes and determines if the response message from the coin mechanism requires encoding and forwarding or passing of the message to the VMC. As determined by the system <b>500</b> the message is selectively forwarded to the VMC upon processing returning to block <b>1802</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1812</b> a determination is made as to whether the MDB command message is a bill acceptor command message. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the MDB command message is a bill acceptor MDB command message then processing moves to block <b>1814</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the MDB command message is not a bill acceptor MDB command message then processing moves to decision block <b>1818</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1814</b> the MDB command message is encoded and forwarded or passed by way of the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b> to the bill acceptor. Processing then moves to block <b>1816</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1816</b> the system <b>500</b> by way of the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b> receives any response MDB message from the bill acceptor. As required the system <b>500</b> decodes and determines if the response message from the bill acceptor requires encoding and forwarding or passing of the message to the VMC. As determined by the system <b>500</b> the message is selectively forwarded to the VMC upon processing returning to block <b>1802</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1818</b> a determination is made as to whether the MDB command message is a card reader or online module (OLM) command message. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the MDB command message is a card reader or OLM MDB command message then processing moves to block <b>1820</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the MDB command message is not a card reader or OLM MDB command message then processing moves to block <b>1822</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1820</b> the MDB command message is decoded and the appropriate response to the VMC is initiated by the system <b>500</b>. Processing moves back to block <b>1802</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1822</b> the system <b>500</b> optionally sends as a master device a MDB command message to the peripherals interconnected with the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b>. Such peripherals can include coin mechanism, bill acceptor or validator, or other peripherals on the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b>. If the system <b>500</b> does not have a MDB command message to send processing moves back to block <b>1802</b>. If the system <b>500</b> has a command message to send the command message is sent to the desired peripheral device and processing moves to block <b>1824</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1824</b> the system <b>500</b> receives any device response messages resultant from the sent MDB message. Processing then moves to decision block <b>1828</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision block <b>1828</b> a determination is made as to whether any received message or data on the mimic MDB bus needs to be forwarded or passed to the VMC by way of the MDB interface <b>518</b>. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the system has a command message or data to send to the VMC processing moves to block <b>1830</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the system <b>500</b> does not has a command message or data to send to the VMC processing moves to block <b>1826</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1826</b> the terminal system <b>500</b> can manage the data received from the peripheral device as required. Processing moves back to block <b>1802</b>.</p>
    <p>In block <b>1830</b> the terminal system <b>500</b> responds to the VMC POLL command message and responds by passing the command message and or data from the peripheral device to the VMC. Processing moves back to block <b>1802</b>.</p>
