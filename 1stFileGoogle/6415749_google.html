    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p>The present invention relates generally to engines or power devices and, more particularly, to internal combustion engines.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading> <p>Many known conventional internal combustion engines typically have a camshaft for controlling the operation of engine valves such as air intake and exhaust valves. One disadvantage of this arrangement is the inherent parasitic power losses associated with camshafts as well as the relatively slow mechanical actuation of such engine valves which is fixed to engine speed. Another disadvantage is that the timing for opening and closing such engine valves is typically fixed to crankshaft and piston position and generally can be optimized for only one operating condition. Consequently, performance and emissions of the engine may be less than optimum at many other operating conditions. Other known internal combustion engines, described in technical literature, eliminate the camshaft and instead hydraulically actuate such engine valves. However, the electrical actuators used to control such engine valves are typically solenoids which still act too slow and continuously consume electrical power throughout the time such engine valves are opened. It is therefore desirable to provide higher speed of actuation, greater flexibility, and conservation of energy in the operation of such engine valves.</p>
    <p>Some known engines have exhaust-driven turbochargers for improving the power output and efficiency of an engine. However, such turbochargers typically require complex high precision parts and are slow to respond to increased loads on the engine.</p>
    <p>Known engines typically may shut down completely when a failure occurs. Such engine failure and shutdown may quickly lead to more catastrophic damage and/or injury if the engine is, for example, powering a moving occupied vehicle or other craft.</p>
    <p>The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth above.</p>

    <p>In another aspect of the present invention, there is disclosed an internal combustion engine comprising a plurality of power modules wherein each power module includes an actuating fluid compressor chamber and an actuating fluid storage chamber. The actuating fluid compressor chamber and actuating fluid storage chamber of each power module are isolated from fluid communication and independently operable with respect to the actuating fluid compressor chamber and actuating fluid storage chamber of any other power module of the internal combustion engine.</p>
    <p>In another aspect of the present invention, there is disclosed a power module including a rotatable crankshaft, combustion chamber, a movable power piston positioned in the combustion chamber, a fuel injector operable to inject fuel into the combustion chamber, a hydraulically-actuatable intake valve operable to control air flow into the combustion chamber, and a hydraulically-actuatable exhaust valve operable to control exhaust gas flow from the combustion chamber. The crankshaft is selectively rotatable in one of a first angular direction and a reverse angular direction in response to selectable operation of the intake and exhaust valves and fuel injector relative to the position of the power piston.</p>
    <p>In another aspect of the present invention, a method of operating a power module is disclosed comprising the steps of moving a power piston from its expansion position and towards its contraction position, closing an exhaust valve, and then closing an intake valve before the power piston reaches its contraction position.</p>
    <p>One embodiment of the subject invention provides one or more power modules that are capable of operating as a dynamically-variable (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) stroke cycle engine. Each power module when switched to a two-stroke engine cycle is particularly advantageous for developing more power (i.e., more work per unit time or stroke) in a relatively smaller package (e.g., fewer combustion cylinders and related components) compared to conventional two-stroke or four-stroke internal combustion engines. The selectable greater number of strokes per engine cycle of one embodiment of the subject invention are particularly advantageous for facilitating longer duration of containment of exhaust gas within the combustion chamber to ensure more complete burning of combustion byproducts.</p>
    <p>The combustion chamber of each power module is capable of developing relatively high peak fluid pressures that result in relatively higher power output capability. During operation ol the power module, the combustion chamber preferably maintains a residual or minimum fluid pressure greater than atmospheric pressure even when the power piston is at its expansion position. Such residual fluid pressure enables relatively high peak fluid pressures on subsequent engine cycles and thus greater engine efficiency. Each power module has a compressor cell for locally compressing and pumping air and actuating fluid and a separate combustion cell for the generation of power. By dividing these functions into separate cells, each cell advantageously has a larger surface area available for handling the passage of required fluids.</p>
    <p>One embodiment of the subject power module also substitutes digitally-controlled hydraulic valve actuators for conventional camshafts. This improved arrangement provides conservation of electrical energy and greater flexibility for independent control of air, fuel, and exhaust during an engine cycle. The actuators can be dynamically controlled to selectively reverse the rotating direction of the engine crankshaft that simplifies the transmission coupled to the engine. They may also provide engine compression braking and energy recovery when deceleration is desired and/or vary the number of strokes per engine cycle. The above modular design also provide greater safety in terms of relatively low external fluid pressures, relatively low electrical voltages, and limp-home capability in the event of a localized failure. The ability of one embodiment of the subject power module or engine to dynamically vary the number of strokes per engine cycle may enable the power module to exhibit lower noxious emissions than conventional engines.</p>

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Referring to FIGS. 1-17, wherein similar reference numbers or characters designate similar elements or features throughout the Figs., there is shown an exemplary embodiment of an improved environmental and improved performance internal combustion engine <b>10</b> of the present invention. The engine is shown as adapted for a direct-injection dynamically variable-stroke (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) stroke diesel-cycle reciprocating internal combustion engine. However, it should be understood that the present invention is also applicable to other types of engines, including but not limited to, indirect injection engines, rotary engines, and modified-cycle engines.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 1-2, the engine <b>10</b> includes at least one power module <b>12</b> and a drive device such as a rotatable crankshaft <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the drive device may be a hydraulic motor. In the embodiment of FIGS. 1-2, the engine <b>10</b> has a plurality of power modules <b>12</b>, totaling three for example, that are connected to generate work together. However, the engine may have more or less power modules than the illustrated amount. In the embodiment shown, the power modules are arranged substantially in-line relative to one another. Alternatively, the power modules of the engine may be arranged in other patterns or orientations relative to one another such a vee-patterns or opposed patterns.</p>
    <p>As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 6, each power module <b>12</b> includes a separate and independently operable supercharger air system <b>16</b>, an actuating fluid system <b>18</b>, an air intake and exhaust valve system <b>20</b>, a power piston <b>22</b>, at least one fluid injector <b>24</b>, and an electronic control system <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>Each supercharger air system <b>16</b> includes an air compressor cell <b>28</b>, an electronically-controllable magnetically-latchable air supply valve <b>30</b>, an air pump piston <b>32</b>, a combustion cell <b>34</b>, an air storage chamber or accumulator <b>36</b>, and an air check valve <b>38</b>.</p>
    <p>Each air compressor cell <b>28</b> defines a variable-volume air compressor chamber <b>40</b>, at least one air supply port <b>42</b>, and at least one air exit port <b>44</b>. In the embodiment of FIGS. 3 and 5, each air supply port <b>42</b> is adapted to communicate with a source <b>46</b> of supply air such as the atmosphere. Alternatively, the air compressor cell may define multiple (e.g., three) air supply ports and a single air exit port, each arranged in separate fluid communication with the air compressor chamber.</p>
    <p>Each air supply valve <b>30</b> is associated with its respective air supply port <b>42</b> and controls the flow of fluid (i.e., air) therethrough. Preferably, each air supply valve <b>30</b> is a poppet type valve. Each air supply valve <b>30</b> preferably includes a magnetically-latchable poppet <b>48</b> having an end portion <b>50</b> and movable between a closed position and an opened position. Each air supply valve <b>30</b> further includes a housing portion <b>52</b>, a mechanical return spring <b>54</b>, and an opening-direction electrical coil or electromagnet <b>56</b>. The return spring <b>54</b> is operable to bias the poppet <b>48</b> towards its closed position at which the poppet <b>48</b> closes the air supply port <b>42</b> and thereby closes fluid communication between the source <b>46</b> of supply air and the air compressor chamber <b>40</b> via the air supply port <b>42</b>. The opening-direction electrical coil <b>56</b> is located proximate the end portion <b>50</b> of the poppet <b>48</b> and is selectively operable to electromagnetically pull the poppet <b>48</b> towards its opened position at which the poppet <b>48</b> opens the air supply port <b>42</b> and thereby opens fluid communication between the source <b>46</b> of supply air and the air compressor chamber <b>40</b> via the air supply port <b>42</b>.</p>
    <p>The housing portion <b>52</b> and poppet <b>48</b> of the air supply valve <b>30</b> are each formed of a magnetizable material material such as 4140 hardened steel. The attractive residual magnetism of the housing portion <b>52</b> and the poppet <b>48</b> acts as a latching force that maintains the poppet <b>48</b> in its open position even after electrical power to the electrical coil <b>56</b> is terminated. Advantageously, electrical power can be conserved especially when no work is being done with respect to the poppet <b>48</b>. The poppet <b>48</b> can thus be operated in a digital manner, wherein i) an electrical pulse may be provided to the opening-direction electrical coil <b>56</b> to move the poppet <b>48</b> to or towards its opened position against the bias of the compressed return spring <b>54</b> or ii) a reverse electrical pulse may be provided to the electrical coil <b>56</b> to minimize or eliminate the residual magnetism and thereby allow the compressed return spring <b>54</b> to move the poppet <b>48</b> to or towards its closed position.</p>
    <p>Each air pump piston <b>32</b> is positioned in its respective air compressor chamber <b>40</b> and is operable to reciprocally move between i) an expansion position at which the air compressor chamber <b>40</b> reaches its maximum volume and ii) a contraction position at which the air compressor chamber <b>40</b> reaches its minimum volume. Each air pump piston <b>32</b> is coupled to the crankshaft <b>14</b>, by for example a connecting rod (not shown), for synchronized movement therewith.</p>
    <p>Each combustion cell <b>34</b> defines a variable-volume internal combustion chamber <b>58</b> separate from its respective air compressor chamber <b>40</b>, at least one air intake port <b>60</b>, and at least one exhaust port <b>62</b>. Various combinations or numbers of air intake ports <b>60</b> and exhaust ports <b>62</b> are possible. Each air intake port <b>60</b> and exhaust port <b>62</b> is arranged in separate fluid communication with the combustion chamber <b>58</b>. Each exhaust port may also be arranged in fluid communication between the combustion chamber <b>58</b> and a common exhaust manifold <b>63</b>. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-2, the air compressor cell <b>28</b> and the combustion cell <b>34</b> are integrally formed adjacent one another by a common engine block or housing <b>64</b>. Alternatively, the air compressor cell <b>28</b> and the combustion cell <b>34</b> may be components that are directly connected together. In any event, the one or more power modules <b>12</b> advantageously form a relatively compact power unit when compared to a conventional four-stroke engine of similar maximum power output. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-2, the air compressor cells <b>28</b> of the engine <b>10</b> are arranged in an alternating and substantially in-line pattern with respect to the combustion cells <b>34</b>. Other relative orientations between the air compressor cells <b>28</b> and the combustion cells <b>34</b> are possible.</p>
    <p>Each air storage chamber <b>36</b> is arranged in fluid communication between the respective air exit port <b>44</b> of the respective air compressor cell <b>28</b> and the respective air intake port <b>60</b> of the respective combustion cell <b>34</b>. The air compressor chamber <b>40</b> and air storage chamber <b>36</b> of each power module <b>12</b> are isolated from fluid communication (and independently operable) with respect to the air compressor chamber <b>40</b> and air storage chamber <b>36</b> of any other power module <b>12</b> of the engine <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the air storage chambers <b>36</b> may additionally provide pressurized air for other functions such as a pneumatic actuation, turbocharger boost, air horn, pneumatic inflation, etc.</p>
    <p>Each air check valve <b>38</b> is arranged in fluid communication between its respective air exit port <b>44</b> and its respective air storage chamber <b>36</b>. Each air check valve <b>38</b> is operable to allow only one-way fluid flow of air from its respective air compressor chamber <b>40</b> to its respective air storage chamber <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to the embodiments of FIGS. 5-6, the actuating fluid system <b>18</b> includes an actuating fluid compressor cell <b>66</b>, an actuating fluid drain passage <b>68</b>, an electronically-controllable magnetically-latchable actuating fluid supply valve <b>70</b>, an actuating fluid pump piston <b>72</b>, an actuating fluid check valve <b>74</b>, an actuating fluid storage chamber or accumulator <b>76</b>, and an actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b>.</p>
    <p>Each actuating fluid compressor cell defines a variable-volume actuating fluid compressor chamber <b>80</b> and an actuating fluid port <b>82</b> arranged in fluid communication therewith. The actuating fluid port <b>82</b> is adapted to communicate with a source <b>84</b> of actuating fluid such as a tank containing hydraulic fluid, engine lubrication oil, or fuel.</p>
    <p>Each actuating fluid drain passage <b>68</b> is adapted to be arranged in fluid communication with the source <b>84</b> of actuating fluid.</p>
    <p>Each actuating fluid supply valve <b>70</b> is arranged in fluid communication between the source <b>84</b> of actuating fluid and its respective actuating fluid port <b>82</b>. In the embodiment shown, each actuating fluid supply valve <b>70</b> is a digitally-controlled two-way valve. Referring to FIGS. 7-8, each actuating fluid supply valve <b>70</b> includes a magnetically-latchable spool <b>86</b> having one end portion <b>88</b> and an opposite end portion <b>90</b> and movable between a closed position and an opened position, a housing portion <b>92</b>, a closing-direction electrical coil or electromagnet <b>94</b> located proximate the one end portion <b>88</b> of the spool <b>86</b>, and an opening-direction electrical coil or electromagnet <b>96</b> located proximate the opposite end portion <b>90</b> of the spool. The closing-direction electrical coil <b>94</b> is selectively operable to electromagnetically pull the spool <b>86</b> towards one state corresponding to the closed position of the actuating fluid supply valve <b>70</b>. At its one state or closed position, the spool <b>86</b> closes fluid communication between the source <b>84</b> of actuating fluid and the actuating fluid compressor chamber <b>80</b> via the actuating fluid port <b>82</b>. The opening-direction electrical coil <b>96</b> is selectively operable to electromagnetically pull the spool <b>86</b> towards another state corresponding to the opened position of actuating fluid supply valve <b>70</b>. At its another state or opened position, the spool <b>86</b> opens fluid communication between the source <b>84</b> of actuating fluid and the actuating fluid compressor chamber <b>80</b> via the actuating fluid port <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p>The housing portion <b>92</b> and spool <b>86</b> are each formed of a magnetizable material material such as 4140 hardened steel. The attractive residual magnetism of the housing portion <b>92</b> and the spool <b>86</b> acts as a latching force that maintains the spool <b>86</b> in either its closed position or opened position even after electrical power to the respective electrical coil <b>94</b>,<b>96</b> is terminated. Advantageously, electrical power can be conserved especially when no work is being done with respect to the spool <b>86</b>. The spool <b>86</b> can thus be operated in a digital manner , wherein i) an electrical pulse may be provided to the closing-direction electrical coil <b>94</b> to move the spool <b>86</b> to or towards its closed position or ii) an electrical pulse may be provided to the opening-direction electrical coil <b>96</b> to move the spool <b>86</b> to or towards its opened position.</p>
    <p>The actuating fluid pump piston <b>72</b> is positioned in the actuating fluid compressor chamber <b>80</b>. The actuating fluid pump piston <b>72</b> is operable to reciprocally move therein between i) an expansion position at which the actuating fluid compressor chamber <b>80</b> reaches its maximum volume and ii) a contraction position at which the actuating fluid compressor chamber <b>80</b> reaches its minimum volume. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the actuating fluid pump piston <b>72</b> is coupled to the air pump piston <b>32</b> and is mechanically driven thereby.</p>
    <p>The actuating fluid storage chamber <b>76</b> is arranged in fluid communication between the actuating fluid port <b>82</b> and the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b>. The actuating fluid compressor chamber <b>80</b>, actuating fluid storage chamber <b>76</b>, and actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> of each power module <b>12</b> are isolated from fluid communication (and independently operable) with respect to the actuating fluid compressor chamber <b>80</b>, actuating fluid storage chamber <b>76</b>, and actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> of any other power module <b>12</b> of the engine <b>10</b>. The actuating fluid storage chamber <b>76</b> may either be connected to the actuating fluid compressor cell <b>66</b> or integrally formed therewith. Alternatively, the actuating fluid storage chambers <b>76</b> may additionally provide pressurized actuating fluid for other functions.</p>
    <p>The actuating fluid check valve <b>74</b> is arranged in fluid communication between the actuating fluid port <b>82</b> of the actuating fluid compressor cell <b>66</b> and the actuating fluid storage chamber <b>76</b>. The actuating fluid check valve <b>74</b> is operable to allow only one-way fluid flow of actuating fluid from the actuating fluid compressor chamber <b>80</b> to the actuating fluid storage chamber <b>76</b>.</p>
    <p>Each air intake and exhaust valve system <b>20</b> includes at least one hydraulically-actuatable intake valve <b>98</b>, an electronically-controllable magnetically-latchable first control valve <b>100</b> associated with each intake valve <b>98</b>, at least one hydraulically-actuatable exhaust valve <b>102</b>, and an electronically-controllable magnetically-latchable second control valve <b>104</b> associated with each exhaust valve <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p>Each intake valve <b>98</b> is associated with a respective air intake port <b>60</b> of the respective combustion cell <b>34</b> to control the flow of fluid therethrough. Each intake valve <b>98</b> has an actuating fluid chamber <b>106</b> and a piston portion <b>108</b> positioned in the actuating fluid chamber <b>106</b>. In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, each intake valve <b>98</b> is a poppet type valve. The intake valve <b>98</b> is selectively operable to reciprocally move between i) a closed position and ii) an opened position. At its closed position, the intake valve <b>98</b> closes the air intake port <b>60</b> and thereby closes fluid communication between the air storage chamber <b>36</b> and the combustion chamber <b>58</b> via the air intake port <b>60</b>. At its opened position, the intake valve <b>98</b> opens the air intake port <b>60</b> and thereby opens fluid communication between the air storage chamber <b>36</b> and the combustion chamber <b>58</b> via the air intake port <b>60</b>. The intake valve <b>98</b> further includes a mechanical return spring <b>110</b> operable to bias the intake valve <b>98</b> towards its closed position. As shown in FIG. 3, one or more of the intake valves <b>98</b> may optionally be arranged to control the flow of additional fluid, such as compressed natural gas or other alternative fuel, into the combustion chamber <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>Each first control valve <b>100</b> is arranged in fluid communication between the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and the respective actuating fluid chamber <b>106</b> of the respective intake valve <b>98</b>. In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, each first control valve <b>100</b> is a digitally-controllable three-way valve. Referring to FIGS. 9-10, the first control valve <b>100</b> includes a magnetically-latchable spool <b>112</b> having one end portion <b>114</b> and an opposite end portion <b>116</b> and movable between a closed position and an opened position, a housing portion <b>118</b>, a closing-direction electrical coil or electromagnet <b>120</b> located proximate the one end portion of the spool, and an opening-direction electrical coil or electromagnet <b>122</b> located proximate the opposite end portion <b>116</b> of the spool <b>112</b>. The closing-direction electrical coil <b>120</b> is selectively operable to electromagnetically pull the spool <b>112</b> towards one state corresponding to the closed position of the first control valve <b>100</b>. At its one state or closed position, the spool <b>112</b> closes fluid communication between the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>106</b> of the intake valve <b>98</b> and opens fluid communication between the actuating fluid drain passage <b>68</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>106</b> of the intake valve <b>98</b> thereby allowing the intake valve <b>98</b> to be moved towards its closed position. The opening-direction electrical coil <b>122</b> is selectively operable to electromagnetically pull the spool <b>112</b> towards its another state corresponding to the opened position of the first control valve <b>100</b>. At its another state or opened position, the spool <b>112</b> opens fluid communication between the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>106</b> of the intake valve <b>98</b> and closes fluid communication between the actuating fluid drain passage <b>68</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>106</b> of the intake valve <b>98</b> thereby allowing the intake valve <b>98</b> to be hydraulically moved towards its opened position.</p>
    <p>The housing portion <b>118</b> and spool <b>112</b> of the first control valve <b>100</b> are each formed of a magnetizable material material such as 4140 hardened steel. The attractive residual magnetism of the housing portion <b>118</b> and the spool <b>112</b> acts as a latching force that maintains the spool <b>112</b> in either its closed position or opened position even after electrical power to the respective electrical coil <b>120</b>,<b>122</b> is terminated. Advantageously, electrical power can be conserved especially when no work is being done with respect to the spool <b>112</b>. The spool <b>112</b> can thus be operated in a digital manner, wherein i) an electrical pulse may be provided to the closing-direction electrical coil <b>120</b> to move the spool <b>112</b> to or towards its closed position or ii) an electrical pulse may be provided to the opening-direction electrical coil <b>122</b> to move the spool <b>112</b> to or towards its opened position.</p>
    <p>Each hydraulically-actuatable exhaust valve <b>102</b> is associated with a respective exhaust port <b>62</b> of the respective combustion cell <b>34</b> to control the flow of fluid therethrough. In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, each exhaust valve <b>102</b> is a poppet type valve. The exhaust valve <b>102</b> has an actuating fluid chamber <b>124</b> and a piston portion <b>126</b> positioned in the actuating fluid chamber <b>124</b>. The exhaust valve <b>102</b> is selectively operable to reciprocally move between i) a closed position at which the exhaust valve <b>102</b> closes its respective exhaust port <b>62</b> and thereby closes fluid communication between the combustion chamber <b>58</b> and the exhaust port <b>62</b> and ii) an opened position at which the exhaust valve <b>102</b> opens the exhaust port <b>62</b> and thereby opens fluid communication between the combustion chamber <b>58</b> and the exhaust port <b>62</b>. The exhaust valve <b>102</b> further includes a mechanical return spring <b>128</b> operable to bias the exhaust valve <b>102</b> towards its closed position.</p>
    <p>Each second control valve <b>104</b> is arranged in fluid communication between the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>124</b> of the exhaust valve <b>102</b>. In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, each second control valve is a digitally-controllable three-way valve. Referring again to FIGS. 9-10, the second control valve <b>104</b> includes a magnetically-latchable spool <b>112</b> having one end portion <b>114</b> and an opposite end portion <b>116</b> and movable between a closed position and an opened position, a housing portion <b>118</b>, a closing-direction electrical coil or electromagnet <b>120</b> located proximate the one end portion <b>114</b> of the spool <b>112</b>, and an opening-direction electrical coil or electromagnet <b>122</b> located proximate the opposite end portion <b>116</b> of the spool <b>112</b>. The closing-direction electrical coil <b>120</b> is selectively operable to electromagnetically pull the spool <b>112</b> towards one state corresponding to the closed position of the second control valve <b>104</b>. At its one state or closed position, the spool <b>112</b> closes fluid communication between the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>124</b> of the exhaust valve <b>102</b> and opens fluid communication between the actuating fluid drain passage <b>68</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>124</b> of the exhaust valve <b>102</b> thereby allowing the exhaust valve <b>102</b> to be moved towards its closed position. The opening-direction electrical coil <b>122</b> is selectively operable to electromagnetically pull the spool <b>112</b> towards another state corresponding to the opened position of the second control valve <b>104</b>. At its another state or opened position, the spool <b>112</b> opens fluid communication between the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>124</b> of the exhaust valve <b>102</b> and closes fluid communication between the actuating fluid drain passage <b>68</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>124</b> of the exhaust valve <b>102</b> thereby allowing the exhaust valve <b>102</b> to be hydraulically moved towards its opened position.</p>
    <p>The housing portion <b>118</b> and spool <b>112</b> of the second control valve <b>104</b> are each formed of a magnetizable material material such as 4140 hardened steel. The attractive residual magnetism of the housing portion <b>118</b> and the spool <b>112</b> acts as a latching force that maintains the spool <b>112</b> in either its closed position or opened position even after electrical power to the respective electrical coil <b>120</b>,<b>122</b> is terminated. Advantageously, electrical power can be conserved especially when no work is being done with respect to the spool <b>112</b>. The spool <b>122</b> can thus be operated in a digital manner, wherein i) an electrical pulse may be provided to the closing-direction electrical coil <b>120</b> to move the spool <b>112</b> to or towards its closed position or ii) an electrical pulse may be provided to the opening-direction electrical coil <b>122</b> to move the spool <b>112</b> to or towards its opened position.</p>
    <p>Each power piston <b>22</b> is positioned in its respective combustion chamber <b>58</b> and is coupled to the crankshaft <b>14</b> (by, for example, a connecting rod that is not shown) for synchronized movement therewith. The power piston <b>22</b> is operable to move therein between i) an expansion position at which the combustion chamber <b>58</b> reaches its maximum volume and ii) a contraction position at which the combustion chamber <b>58</b> reaches its minimum volume.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 10-13, each fluid injector <b>24</b> is preferably a hydraulically-actuatable electronically-control lable fluid-intensifiable injector selectively operable to inject fluid into the combustion chamber <b>58</b>. The fluid injected by the injector <b>24</b> is preferably a fuel such as diesel fuel or gasoline. In the embodiment shown, the injector <b>24</b> includes an electronically-controllable magnetically-latchable third control valve <b>142</b>, an actuating fluid chamber <b>144</b>, a fluid pressure intensification device <b>146</b> including an intensifier piston <b>148</b> and a fuel plunger <b>150</b>, a fuel pump chamber <b>152</b>, an injection check valve <b>154</b>, and a fluid spray tip <b>156</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 5, <b>6</b>, and <b>13</b>, the third control valve <b>142</b> is preferably a three-way control valve, similar to the first and second control valves <b>100</b>,<b>104</b>, but arranged in fluid communication between the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>144</b> of the injector <b>24</b>. The third control valve <b>142</b> is selectively operable to move between i) a closed position and ii) an opened position. At its closed position, the third control valve <b>142</b> closes fluid communication between the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>144</b> of the injector <b>24</b> and opens fluid communication between the actuating fluid drain passage <b>68</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>144</b> of the injector <b>24</b> thereby allowing the check valve <b>154</b> to be moved towards its closed position and terminate fuel injection into the combustion chamber <b>58</b> via the spray tip <b>156</b>. At its opened position, the third control valve <b>142</b> opens fluid communication between the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>144</b> of the injector <b>24</b> and closes fluid communication between the actuating fluid drain passage <b>68</b> and the actuating fluid chamber <b>144</b> of the injector <b>24</b> thereby allowing the check valve <b>154</b> to be hydraulically moved towards its opened position and initiate fuel injection into the combustion chamber <b>58</b> via the spray tip <b>156</b>.</p>
    <p>The check valve <b>154</b> of the fluid injector <b>24</b> is preferably a spool-type check valve movable between a closed position at which the check valve <b>154</b> blocks injection of fuel through the spray tip <b>156</b> and an opened position at which the check valve <b>154</b> opens injection of fuel through the spray tip <b>156</b>. Alternatively, the check valve <b>154</b> may be a poppet-type check valve. Preferably, the spray tip <b>156</b> extends directly into the respective combustion chamber <b>58</b> and defines a plurality of fluid spray orifices <b>158</b>,<b>160</b> staggered along the longitudinal axis <b>162</b> of the spray tip <b>156</b>. Preferably, the pilot spray orifices <b>158</b> (located nearest to the closed check valve) are formed relatively more restricted for optimum pilot injection and the main spray orifices <b>160</b> (located furthest from the closed check valve) are formed relatively less restricted for main fluid injection. Advantageously, the one or more pilot spray orifices <b>158</b> open sequentially before the one or more main spray orifices <b>160</b> when the check valve <b>154</b> is moved from its closed position to its opened position. Thus, the fluid injector <b>24</b> is capable of providing multiple stages of fluid injection in order to ensure optimum atomization of fuel and mixing with air under all engine operating conditions (e.g., idle as well as full engine load conditions). Consequently, the fuel and air in the combustion chamber <b>58</b> are burned more efficiently and completely thereby producing lower emissions and lower fuel consumption for a given power output.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 6 and 15, the electronic control system <b>26</b> includes at least one electronic control unit <b>164</b>, at least one drive module <b>166</b>, and one or more sensors. In one embodiment of the present invention, a single electronic control unit <b>164</b> is provided for the entire engine <b>10</b>. Alternatively, a separate electronic control unit <b>164</b> may be provided for each power module <b>12</b> of the engine <b>10</b>. The electronic control unit <b>164</b> is operable to selectively and independently control the operation (including timing and duration) of each electronically-controllable valve <b>30</b>,<b>70</b>,<b>100</b>,<b>104</b>,<b>142</b> of each power module <b>12</b> with one or more digital pulses of electrical current generated by the respective drive module <b>166</b>. Control input signals (such as starter operation inputs, ignition switch position, and engine brake) communicated to the electronic control unit <b>164</b> are generally indicated by reference number <b>168</b>. Input sensor signals (indicating for example, actuating fluid temperature, actuating fluid pressure, manifold air pressure, exhaust back pressure, etc.) communicated to the electronic control unit <b>164</b> are generally indicated by reference number <b>170</b>. Output signals communicated by the electronic control unit <b>164</b> to actuators associated with, for example, a relatively low pressure actuating fluid supply pump <b>172</b> (FIG. 6) or engine starter (not shown) are generally indicated by reference number <b>174</b>. Reference number <b>176</b> indicates crankshaft or power piston position input signals that are communicated to the electronic control unit <b>164</b> and each drive module <b>166</b> from a crankshaft or power piston position sensor <b>177</b> and master timing unit <b>178</b>.</p>
    <p>Each drive module <b>166</b> may either be formed as a separate device or integrally formed with the electronic control unit <b>164</b>. Each drive module <b>166</b> preferably includes an injector drive module <b>180</b> and an engine valve drive module <b>182</b>. Alternatively, the injector drive module <b>180</b> and engine valve drive module <b>182</b> may be formed as a single device. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 15, a control area network (CAN) <b>184</b> is connected between the electronic control unit <b>164</b> and each drive module <b>180</b>,<b>182</b> for electronically sharing information, such as engine speed and actuating fluid temperature, and for electronically communicating commands or instructions.</p>
    <p>Reference number <b>186</b> generally refers to input signals, indicating one or more parameters of injector operation (e.g., position), communicated to the injector drive module <b>180</b> for closed-loop control. Reference number <b>188</b> generally refers to output signals communicated by the injector drive module to one or more third control valves <b>142</b> of the injectors <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>Reference number <b>190</b> generally refers to input signals, indicating one or more parameters of engine valve operation (e.g., position), communicated to the engine valve drive module <b>182</b> for closed-loop control. Reference number <b>192</b> generally refers to output signals communicated by the engine valve drive module <b>182</b> to one or more of the first and second control valves <b>100</b>,<b>104</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 6, the one or more sensors preferably includes at least one air pressure sensor <b>194</b>, and at least one actuating fluid pressure sensor <b>196</b>. The air pressure sensor <b>194</b> is operable to sense the pressure of air in the respective air storage chamber <b>36</b> and provide the respective electronic control unit <b>164</b> with a signal indicative of such pressure. The electronic control unit <b>164</b> and respective engine valve drive module <b>182</b> is operable to move the air supply valve <b>30</b> i) to its opened position in response to the pressure being below a threshold air pressure and ii) to its closed position in response to the pressure being at least the threshold air pressure.</p>
    <p>The actuating fluid pressure sensor <b>196</b> is operable to i) sense the pressure of actuating fluid in the actuating fluid storage chamber <b>76</b> and ii) provide the electronic control unit <b>164</b> with an actuating fluid pressure signal indicative of said pressure. The electronic control unit <b>164</b> is operable to independently control the operation of the actuating fluid supply valve <b>70</b> in response to the magnitude of the actuating fluid pressure signal.</p>
    <p>The electronic control system <b>26</b> may further include another actuating fluid pressure sensor <b>198</b> for each actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b>. The another actuating fluid pressure sensor <b>198</b> is operable to i) sense the pressure of actuating fluid in the actuating fluid common rail <b>78</b> and ii) provide the electronic control unit <b>164</b> with another actuating fluid pressure signal indicative of that pressure. The electronic control unit <b>164</b> is operable to independently control the operation of the first and second control valves <b>100</b>,<b>104</b> in response to the magnitude of this another actuating fluid pressure signal.</p>
    <p>The crankshaft <b>14</b> is selectively rotatable in one angular direction and a reverse angular direction in response to selectable timing and sequence of operation of the air intake valve(s) <b>98</b>, exhaust valve(s) <b>102</b>, and the injector <b>24</b> relative to the position of the power piston <b>22</b>. This advantageously eliminates the need for a reverse gear in a transmission (not shown) connected to the engine <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>An alternative embodiment of the power module <b>12</b> is shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. The power module <b>12</b>′ may be similar to the power module previously described except that it has a modified supercharger air system, a turbocharger <b>214</b> having an exhaust gas inlet <b>216</b> and a compressed air outlet <b>218</b>, and a modified air intake and exhaust valve system. The modified supercharger air system <b>16</b>′ includes an air compressor cell <b>28</b>′, a free air supply valve <b>30</b>′, a turbocharged air supply valve <b>30</b>″, an air pump piston <b>32</b>, a combustion cell <b>58</b>′, and an air storage chamber <b>76</b>.</p>
    <p>The air compressor cell <b>28</b>′ defines a variable-volume air compressor chamber <b>40</b>, at least one free air supply port <b>42</b>′ adapted to communicate with atmosphere, at least one turbocharged air supply port <b>42</b>″ arranged in fluid communication with the compressed air outlet <b>218</b> of the turbocharger <b>214</b>, and an air exit port <b>44</b>. The free air supply port <b>42</b>′, turbocharged air supply port <b>42</b>″, and air exit port <b>44</b> are each arranged in separate fluid communication with the air compressor chamber <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>The free air supply valve <b>30</b>′ is associated with the free air supply port <b>42</b>′ to control the flow of fluid therethrough. The free air supply valve <b>30</b>′ is selectively operable to move between i) a closed position and ii) an opened position. At its closed position, the free air supply valve <b>30</b>′ closes the free air supply port <b>42</b>′ and thereby closes fluid communication between atmosphere and the air compressor chamber <b>40</b> via the free air supply port <b>42</b>′. At its opened position, the free air supply valve <b>30</b>′ opens the free air supply port <b>42</b>′ and thereby opens fluid communication between atmosphere and the air compressor chamber <b>40</b> via the free air supply port <b>42</b>′.</p>
    <p>The turbocharged air supply valve <b>30</b>″ is associated with each turbocharged air supply port <b>42</b>″ and is selectively operable to move between i) a closed position and ii) an opened position. At its closed position, the turbocharged air supply valve <b>30</b>″ closes its respective turbocharged air supply port <b>42</b>″ and thereby closes fluid communication between the compressed air outlet <b>218</b> of the turbocharger <b>214</b> and the air compressor chamber <b>40</b> via the respective turbocharged air supply port <b>42</b>″. At its opened position, the turbocharged air supply valve <b>30</b>″ opens its respective turbocharged air supply port <b>42</b>″ and thereby opens fluid communication between the compressed air outlet <b>218</b> of the turbocharger <b>214</b> and the air compressor chamber <b>40</b> via the respective turbocharged air supply port <b>42</b>″.</p>
    <p>The combustion cell <b>34</b> defines a variable-volume combustion chamber <b>58</b>′ separate from the air compressor chamber <b>40</b>, an air intake port <b>60</b>, a free exhaust port <b>62</b>′ adapted to communicate with atmosphere, and at least one drive exhaust port <b>62</b>″ arranged in fluid communication with the exhaust gas inlet <b>216</b> of the turbocharger <b>214</b>. The air intake port <b>60</b>, free exhaust port <b>62</b>′, and drive exhaust port <b>62</b>″ are each arranged in separate fluid communication with the combustion chamber <b>58</b>′.</p>
    <p>The modified air intake and exhaust valve system includes at least one intake valve <b>98</b>, at least one free exhaust valve <b>102</b>′, and at least one drive exhaust valve <b>102</b>″. The free exhaust valve <b>102</b>′ is associated with the free exhaust port <b>62</b>′ of the combustion cell <b>34</b> and is selectively operable to move between i) a closed position and an opened position. At its closed position, the free exhaust valve <b>102</b>′ closes the free exhaust port <b>62</b>′ and thereby closes fluid communication between the combustion chamber <b>58</b>′ and atmosphere via the free exhaust port. At its opened position, the free exhaust valve <b>102</b>′ opens the free exhaust port <b>62</b>′ and thereby opens fluid communication between the combustion chamber <b>58</b>′ and atmosphere via the free exhaust port <b>62</b>′.</p>
    <p>The drive exhaust valve <b>102</b>″ is associated with each drive exhaust port <b>62</b>″ of the combustion cell <b>34</b> and is selectively operable to move between i) a closed position and ii) an opened position. At its closed position, the drive exhaust valve <b>102</b>″ closes its respective drive exhaust port <b>62</b>″ and thereby closes fluid communication between the combustion chamber <b>58</b>′ and the exhaust gas inlet <b>216</b> of the turbocharger <b>214</b> via the respective drive exhaust port <b>62</b>″. At its opened position, the drive exhaust valve <b>102</b>″ opens its respective drive exhaust port <b>62</b>″ and thereby opens fluid communication between the combustion chamber <b>58</b>′ and the exhaust gas inlet <b>216</b> of the turbocharger <b>214</b> via the respective drive exhaust port <b>62</b>″.</p>
    <heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading> <p>One embodiment of the subject invention is capable of operating as a dynamically-variable (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) stroke per cycle internal combustion engine <b>10</b>. One embodiment of the subject power module <b>12</b> or engine <b>10</b> when switched to a two-stroke engine cycle is particularly advantageous for instantly developing more power (i.e., more work per unit time or stroke) in a relatively smaller package (e.g., fewer combustion cylinders and related components) compared to conventional four-stroke internal combustion engines. This design advantageously incorporates one or more poppet-type air intake valves <b>98</b> and one or more poppet-type exhaust valves <b>102</b> for possible two-cycle operation yet avoids possible collision between the power piston <b>22</b> and such poppet valves. This is because such poppet-type valves can be actuated when the power piston is far enough away from its top dead center position. The selectable engine cycles having a greater number of strokes per engine cycle are particularly advantageous for facilitating longer duration of containment of exhaust gas within the combustion chamber <b>58</b> to facilitate more complete burning of combustion gases or byproducts</p>
    <p>An exemplary method of two-stroke diesel-cycle operation will now be described although it should be understood that the subject power module <b>12</b> and engine <b>10</b> are capable of many other types of operation.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 15-16, the start of fuel injection (corresponding to power piston position F<sub>S</sub>) and the end of fuel injection (corresponding to power piston position F<sub>E</sub>) into the combustion chamber <b>58</b> typically occurs over a crankshaft angular displacement A<sub>F </sub>when the intake valve(s) <b>98</b> and exhaust valve(s) <b>102</b> are both closed. For example, the start of injection F<sub>S </sub>may occur about 15° before the top dead center position (TDC) of the power piston <b>22</b> and continue for a total crankshaft angular displacement A<sub>F </sub>of about 23°. The exhaust valve <b>102</b> is opened at power piston position E<sub>O </sub>after the power piston <b>22</b> has been moved over a work or power producing crankshaft angular displacement A<sub>P </sub>which may, for example, equal about 140° after TDC of the power piston <b>22</b>. During this period, exhaust gas within the combustion chamber escapes through the opened exhaust port. After the fluid pressure within the combustion chamber <b>58</b> has minimized to a selected level, the intake valve <b>98</b> is subsequently opened at power piston position I<sub>O </sub>which may, for example, correspond to about 160° after TDC. While the intake valve <b>98</b> remains open, pressurized air from the air storage chamber <b>36</b> is communicated to the combustion chamber <b>58</b> and further assists the expulsion of exhaust gas. The power piston <b>22</b> is then moved to its expansion position BDC and then towards its contraction position TDC. The exhaust valve <b>102</b> is then closed at power piston position E<sub>C </sub>which may, for example, correspond to about 20° after BDC of the power piston <b>22</b> or about 200° after TDC of the power piston <b>22</b>. During this period, the intake valve <b>98</b> remains open a selected amount of time facilitate pressurization of the combustion chamber <b>58</b> to a selected residual pressure PR. The intake valve <b>98</b> is then closed at power piston position I<sub>C </sub>which may, for example, correspond to about 40° after BDC of the power piston <b>22</b> or about 220° after TDC of the power piston <b>22</b>. The power piston <b>22</b> is then moved along its compression phase A<sub>C </sub>towards its contraction position (TDC). The timing and duration of actuation of each of the intake valve(s) and exhaust valve(s) may be independently chosen and varied as desired. Moreover, in the case of multiple intake valves and/or multiple exhaust valves, actuation of each group may be staged over time.</p>
    <p>In this example, the total crankshaft angular displacement during the time the exhaust valve <b>102</b> opens (E<sub>o</sub>), the intake valve <b>98</b> opens (I<sub>o</sub>), the exhaust valve <b>102</b> closes (E<sub>C</sub>), and the intake valve <b>98</b> closes (Ic) is about 80°. In contrast, conventional two-stroke engines typically have a total crankshaft angular displacement of about 150° between the time the exhaust valve opens, the intake valve opens, the intake valve closes, and the exhaust valve closes. This relatively shorter duration of total valve actuation associated with one embodiment of the subject invention advantageously increases the available work or power producing crankshaft angular displacement A<sub>P</sub>.</p>
    <p>During operation, the power module <b>12</b> is capable of maintaining at least a residual or minimum fluid pressure P<sub>R</sub>, in the combustion chamber <b>58</b> that is greater than atmospheric pressure, substantially throughout the engine cycle of operation For example, in the embodiment illustrated, the residual fluid pressure P<sub>R </sub>in the combustion chamber <b>58</b> may be at least about 138 kPa (about 20 psi) and may lie in the range of about 138 to 207 kPa (about 20 to 30 psi). Conventional two-stroke engines are merely able to maintain a residual fluid pressure of about 0 to 34.5 kPa (0 to 5 psi). The relatively higher residual fluid pressures P<sub>R </sub>of the present invention enable relatively higher peak fluid pressures P<sub>P </sub>(for example, at least about 13,790 kPa /2000 psi) to be produced in the combustion chamber <b>58</b> during the engine cycle.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 16, the two areas W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2 </sub>enclosed by the pressure P versus volume V curve indicate the net amount of work done by the power piston <b>22</b> during one cycle of operation. The relatively high peak fluid pressure P<sub>P </sub>therefore contributes to a relatively higher work or power output of the power module <b>12</b> or engine <b>10</b>. Generally, such peak fluid pressures P<sub>P </sub>of one embodiment of the subject invention may be limited by the strength of material(s) for the combustion cell <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of one embodiment the power module <b>12</b> is that it has an air compressor chamber <b>40</b> for locally compressing air and a separate combustion chamber <b>58</b> for the generation of power. By dividing these functions into separate chambers, each chamber advantageously has a larger available surface area available for handling (i.e., admitting and transferring) required fluids.</p>
    <p>One embodiment of the subject power module also substitutes digitally-controllable valve actuators <b>30</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>100</b>,<b>104</b>,<b>142</b> for conventional camshafts or solenoid-type actuators. Such digitally-controllable actuators provide greater flexibility (i.e., greater independence) and relatively fast flow control of air, fuel, and exhaust gas relative to the combustion chamber <b>58</b> during an engine cycle. Such actuators can be dynamically controlled to even selectively reverse the rotating direction of the engine crankshaft <b>14</b>. This capability advantageously eliminates the need for a reverse gear in a transmission coupled to one embodiment of the subject power module or engine. Such actuators also conserve electrical energy and may also provide engine compression braking and energy recovery when deceleration is desired and/or vary the number of strokes per engine cycle. One embodiment of the subject power module features a modular cylinder head design for greater serviceability and also facilitating a choice in the number of power modules <b>12</b> coupled to form an engine <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The electronic control system <b>26</b> may be formed of individual electronic control units <b>162</b> associated with each power module <b>12</b> that provides greater flexibility (i.e., greater independence) in the control of air, fuel and exhaust gas relative to each power module <b>12</b>. The combustion chamber <b>58</b> of each power module <b>12</b> is supercharged by its own built-in air compressor and air storage chamber thus providing instant full power in a simple and reliable package. The above modular features also provide greater safety in terms of relatively low external fluid pressures and relatively low electrical voltages. The independently operating power modules <b>12</b> collectively enable limp-home capability in the event of a localized failure. The fluid injector <b>24</b> is capable of effectively controlling the injection of fuel for optimum atomization and mixing with air under a wide range of operating conditions. Each power module <b>12</b> has its own source of pressurized actuating fluid by means of a separate built-in actuating fluid pump. This eliminates the need for conventional high pressure actuating fluid common rails that may disable an entire engine in the event of failure. The ability of the power module <b>12</b> to dynamically vary the number of strokes per engine cycle may enable the power module <b>12</b> to exhibit lower noxious emissions than conventional engines.</p>
