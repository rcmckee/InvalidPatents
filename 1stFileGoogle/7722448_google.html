Governor balls, acting as centrifugal weights, spin with the motor and push against an inclined flange on a valve head to move the valve head towards a valve seat. The motion of the valve head compresses a biasing spring and restricts the flow of pressurized air as the desired speed is exceeded. As speed decreases, centrifugal force decreases and the biasing spring opens the valve to provide additional power to the motor. The disk blades are provided with a cylindrical central lip that substantially increases the area of the central bearing that the blades turn on and produces significantly longer blade life.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to handheld dehiders and powered skinning knives used to remove the hide of a carcass in a meat processing facility. More specifically, the present invention relates to dehiders that use a pair of cutting disks driven in opposed cutting oscillations.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Handheld dehiders are used in meat processing facilities to remove the hide from an animal carcass. The most common type of dehider includes a pair of adjacent cutting disks or blades that are driven in opposed cutting oscillations by a corresponding pair of pushrods. The basic design is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,092 assigned to Jarvis Products Corporation, the assignee of the present invention. Similar dehider designs are shown and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,368,560, 3,435,522 and 2,751,680.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">In the dehider design described in the patents above, each cutting blade includes teeth around its perimeter. The adjacent disk blades are driven in opposed cutting oscillations by a pair of pushrods connected to an eccentric drive mechanism operated by a pneumatic motor mounted in the handle of the tool.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">The motor rotates a pinion gear, which turns a main drive gear oriented at ninety degrees to the axis of the motor. The main drive gear turns the eccentric shaft to oscillate the pushrods. During each oscillation, the teeth on one disk blade move past the teeth on the adjacent and oppositely moving disk blade. This produces a shearing and cutting action that quickly removes the hide from the carcass.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Although this dehider design has proven effective, existing designs tend to slow down under a heavy cutting load and then return to a higher speed as the cutting load is removed. To achieve the optimum cutting speed while operating under load, dehiders of this type must be set to run at a higher speed when they are not cutting. This higher no-load speed produces undesirable increases in tool wear and noise. The excess speed under the no-load condition is particularly problematical for a dehider having oscillating blades due to the frequent forward and back reversals of the blades and pushrods and the wear associated with the oscillating motion at high speed.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Another problem in existing designs lies in the design of the oscillating disk blades. These blades have heretofore been constructed with a constant thickness at all locations—except at the cutting edges where the thickness decreases to form the sharpened blade edges and teeth. In particular, the inner bearing area of the cutting disk has been of the same thickness as the outer portions of the blade. Each blade rotates about a bearing formed by a hole in this inner bearing area.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">The limited thickness of the blade is advantageous at the outer edges of the blade, but it limits the bearing surface area at the center. The limited size of the bearing center hole produces wear at a greater rate than is desirable. As the blade wears, the center hole enlarges until the blade eventually becomes unusable. Often, it is this center bearing wear that limits the useful life of the blade. If not for this excess bearing wear, the blade could be sharpened additionally and the useful life of the blade extended.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Still another problem lies in the oscillating nature of the eccentric-driven pushrods and blades, which produces substantial vibration. A known method of reducing this vibration is to use a counterbalance mass on the main drive gear, however, this solution is only partly effective. In order to avoid interference with the oscillating pushrods, the main drive gear and any counterbalance mass connected thereto must be vertically offset from the plane of the pushrods. The offset between the moving mass of the pushrods and the oppositely moving mass of the counterbalance on the main drive gear produces a wobbling motion.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Initially, the magnitude of this wobbling motion is quite limited and the tool can be used comfortably for long periods of time. However, over time, the wobbling motion produces significant excess wear. As the bearings and moving parts begin to wear, the wobble increases in amplitude until it produces an extremely objectionable vibration. Moreover, the wear produced by this motion shortens the lifetime of the component parts in the tool.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Bearing in mind the problems and deficiencies of the prior art, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a handheld dehider that operates at a nearly constant speed when operating under a load and when operating without a load.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a handheld dehider with blades that wear at the center bearing more slowly than existing designs.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">A further object of the present invention is to provide a handheld dehider with less vibration that can be comfortably used for long periods of time.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">It is another object of the present invention to provide a handheld dehider that wears less rapidly due to reduced vibration.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Still another object of the invention is to provide a counterbalanced eccentric shaft for a handheld dehider with an integrated counterbalance mass.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a counterbalance cup for a handheld dehider with an integrated counterbalance mass.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0020">The above and other objects, which will be apparent to those skilled in the art, are achieved in the present invention which is directed to a handheld dehider having a pair of cutting disks mounted on a cutting disk shaft, and a drive mechanism for driving the cutting disks in opposed cutting oscillations. The drive mechanism includes an eccentric shaft and a pair of pushrods, one for each cutting disk, each pushrod being connected between the eccentric shaft and its respective cutting disk. A pneumatic motor mounted in a housing is connected to turn the eccentric shaft and oscillate the pair of pushrods. The housing includes an air inlet for providing a flow of pressurized air to the motor, and a speed governor connected between the air inlet and the motor, the speed governor automatically controlling the flow of pressurized air from the air inlet to the pneumatic motor to maintain a desired rotational speed for the motor.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">In one aspect of the invention, the speed governor is connected to spin with the pneumatic motor and operates by centrifugal force to restrict the flow of pressurized air from the air inlet to the pneumatic motor to decrease the speed of the motor when the motor speed is above the desired rotational speed.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">In the preferred embodiment, the speed governor includes a valve head connected to spin with the pneumatic motor and the air inlet is connected to a valve seat. The valve head moves towards the valve seat to restrict the flow of pressurized air from the air inlet to the pneumatic motor and decrease the speed of the motor when the motor speed is above the desired rotational speed.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">In another aspect of the invention, the speed governor includes a governor spring biasing the valve head away from the valve seat and a movable mass connected to spin with the pneumatic motor. The movable mass moves outward as the speed governor spins and compresses the governor spring to move the valve head towards the valve seat and restrict the flow of pressurized air from the air inlet to the pneumatic motor.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">The movable mass is preferably one or more governor balls that contact an angled flange on the valve head. As the balls spin, they exert centrifugal force against the angled flange to compress the governor spring and move the valve head towards the valve seat.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">In another aspect of the dehider design, the housing includes a drive mechanism cover having three pieces. A drive mechanism cover portion is located over the drive gear. A barrier plate portion is located under the pushrods and wall portion connects the drive mechanism cover portion to the barrier plate portion. The drive mechanism cover is preferably an integral piece made of steel.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">In still another preferred aspect of the dehider design, each cutting disk includes a central opening and a bearing lip surrounding the central opening. The central openings and bearing lips of the pair of cutting disks form a bearing having an enlarged bearing surface that surrounds the cutting disk shaft. The cutting disk shaft may include a cylindrical collar having an outer bearing surface that the central opening and bearing lip of each cutting disk surrounds. The central openings and bearing lips of the pair of cutting disks cooperate to form a bearing having an inner bearing surface that contacts the outer bearing surface of the cylindrical collar.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">In yet another aspect of the handheld dehider design, the dehider housing includes a first cover adjacent a first one of the pair of cutting disks and a second cover adjacent a second one of the pair of cutting disks. The first cover has a recess for receiving the bearing lip of the first one of the pair of cutting disks and the second cover has another recess for receiving the bearing lip of the second one of the pair of cutting disks. The cylindrical collar may also be received in the recesses of the first and second covers.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">The bearing lip surrounding the central opening of each cutting disk preferably projects outwardly from only one side of each cutting disk so that the pair of disks may be assembled back to back without interference between their respective bearing lips.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading> <p num="p-0040">In describing the preferred embodiment of the present invention, reference will be made herein to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref> of the drawings in which like numerals refer to like features of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a handheld dehider <b>10</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The dehider <b>10</b> includes a pair of adjacent cutting disks <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> having teeth <b>16</b> located around the perimeter of each disk. The cutting disks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are driven by a pair of pushrods <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in opposed cutting oscillations by an eccentric shaft <b>22</b> (seen best in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0042">The eccentric shaft <b>22</b> is driven by pneumatic motor <b>24</b> located in the handle <b>26</b> of the tool housing. The motor <b>24</b> drives pinion gear <b>28</b>, which engages and turns the main drive gear <b>30</b>. The main drive gear <b>30</b> is mounted on the eccentric shaft <b>22</b> such that rotation of the motor and pinion gear turns the main drive gear and eccentric shaft to drive the pushrods and cutting disks.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">The eccentric shaft <b>22</b> is held between a pair of bearings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> mounted in the housing <b>36</b> of the dehider. The housing includes the handle <b>26</b> at the back of the tool and a forward end of the tool that wraps around and below the drive area and extends underneath the cutting disks. The housing also includes a drive mechanism cover <b>37</b> that extends over the drive area and immediately below the cutting disks, and a blade cover <b>39</b> located above the cutting disks. The housing design allows easy cleaning and removal of the drive mechanism without removing the motor.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">The drive mechanism cover <b>37</b> includes three pieces including a drive mechanism cover portion <b>41</b>, a barrier plate portion <b>45</b> and wall portion <b>43</b> that connects the other two pieces. The drive mechanism cover portion <b>41</b> covers the top of the gear assembly and provides access thereto. The barrier plate <b>45</b> passes underneath the cutting disks and separates them from the pushrods. The wall portion <b>43</b> connects the other two pieces and further isolates the drive mechanism from the cutting disks.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">These three pieces cooperate to substantially seal the drive mechanism inside the tool and separate the drive mechanism and pushrods from the cutting disks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. The cutting disks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are located on one side of the barrier plate, in contact with the flat portion thereof. The barrier plate <b>45</b> serves not only as a barrier against the entry of contaminating material, but also as a flat bearing surface against which the cutting disk <b>14</b> slides. This large flat bearing surface stabilizes the cutting disks and prevents them from twisting during use. Accordingly, to minimize wear, the barrier plate is preferably made of a harder material than the remainder of the housing. Prior art designs which incorporated the barrier plate into the housing were required to make the housing and the barrier plate of the same material. As a result, additional processing steps were required to properly harden the face of the barrier plate and prevent undue wear.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">In the present invention, both the drive mechanism cover portion and the barrier portion are preferably made of steel. Moreover, the steel forms an excellent material for receiving the bearing <b>32</b>, and in the event bearing <b>32</b> locks up, the damage caused will be less than if the drive mechanism cover were manufactured of aluminum. If the damage is excessive, the drive mechanism cover may easily be replaced.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">The main drive gear <b>30</b> has inwardly facing teeth and is driven by the motor <b>24</b> through the pinion gear <b>28</b>. Because the main drive gear is mounted on the same side of the pinion gear as the drive mechanism cover, the complete drive mechanism may be removed from the housing merely by removing the drive mechanism cover.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">The pushrods <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are driven by the eccentric shaft such that the back ends of the pushrods are concentrically engaged by the eccentric shaft and move in a circle as the eccentric shaft turns. The front ends of the pushrods move forwards and backwards approximately parallel to the axis of the dehider tool. The moving front ends are connected to the cutting disks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, through the barrier plate, with one pushrod to each disk.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">Each pushrod extends to an opposite side of the cutting disk shaft <b>38</b> and connects to its associated cutting disk on its respective side of the cutting disk shaft. As each pushrod moves forward, it turns the cutting disk it is connected to in the opposite direction from the cutting disk being driven by the other pushrod on the opposite side of the cutting disk shaft <b>38</b>. This produces the opposed cutting disk oscillations of this tool.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">During each cutting oscillation the teeth <b>16</b> on cutting disk <b>12</b> pass by the oppositely moving teeth on adjacent cutting disk <b>14</b>. As the eccentric shaft continues to rotate, the pushrods <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are drawn back and the direction of motion of the cutting disks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is reversed. This causes the cutting teeth <b>16</b> on one cutting disk to again pass by the oppositely moving teeth on the other cutting disk to produce a scissors-like action between the oppositely moving teeth that quickly and effectively allows the dehider operator to remove the hide of the carcass.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">A more detailed description of operation and the advantages of the housing design can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,092, assigned to Jarvis Products Corporation, the assignee of the present invention, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">From the description above, it will be understood that all hand-held dehiders of this basic design are subject to a vibration resulting from the oscillating mass of the pushrods and cutting disks being driven by the eccentric drive system. During each rotation of the eccentric shaft, the two pushrods are driven forward and back, and the disk blades are accelerated in a first direction, then stopped and accelerated in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">A known method of reducing this vibration is to provide a counterbalance mass on the main drive gear <b>30</b>. The counterbalance mass on the main drive gear (which is located in the drive section near the top of the tool in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is arranged so that it is moving back (towards the handle of the tool) as the eccentric portion of the eccentric shaft (located in the drive section near the bottom of the tool in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is moving the two pushrods forward (towards the cutting disks on the working end of the tool).</p>
    <p num="p-0054">The principal difficulty with this method of vibration reduction resides in the fact that it does not provide true dynamic counterbalancing for the dehider. To provide clearance for the pushrods, and to allow the drive mechanism to be removed without removing the motor, the main drive gear must be located above the axis of the motor—in a plane that is well above the plane of the oscillating mass of the pushrods. Consequently, as the pushrods are being driven forward by the eccentric shaft, there is a backwards reaction force that is applied low in the drive section of the tool (where the eccentric shaft and pushrods are located). Simultaneously, the counterbalance mass on the main drive gear is moving backwards, but this produces a forward reaction force that is applied high in the drive section of the tool, where the main drive gear must be located.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">Although the forces produced by the counterbalance and the moving masses are in the opposite direction, because they are not aligned in the same plane, they do not cancel completely. The force low in the tool's drive section from the moving masses and the force high in the drive section produce a reinforcing torque on the tool that reverses direction with each oscillation of the cutting disks. The result is that in prior art tools, even tools with drive gear counterbalancing, the tool is not dynamically counterbalanced and a wobbling motion is imparted that produces significant wear on the tool's drive components.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">Initially the wobbling motion is relatively small, but as the bearings and pushrods begin to wear, the level of vibration and the wobbling motion increases rapidly to objectionable levels. The present invention addresses this problem by providing two counterbalance masses located on opposite sides of the plane of the pushrods. The two counterbalance masses cooperate to provide counterbalancing which acts at a location between the counterbalance masses and directly opposite and in the same plane as the oscillating mass of the pushrods.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">In the preferred embodiment of this invention, the counterbalance mass above the plane of the pushrods is removed from the main drive gear and is shifted onto a separate counterbalance cup <b>54</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>) that also acts as a spacer. By removing the counterbalance mass from the main drive gear, it can be moved closer to the plane of the pushrods, which reduces the torque produced and the resulting wobbling motion. In addition, the cost of manufacturing the complex main drive gear is substantially reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an eccentric shaft according to the present invention used in the preferred dehider design of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The eccentric shaft <b>22</b> includes first and second cylindrical shaft sections <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> which fit into bearings <b>34</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively. The eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b> is centrally located and cylindrical bearings on the rear ends of the pushrods fit onto the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b>. Adjacent to the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b> is a first counterbalance mass <b>48</b>. It will be noted that the first counterbalance mass <b>48</b> is substantially on the opposite side of the shaft <b>22</b> from the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b>. Thus, when the pushrods are moving toward the front of the tool in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the counterbalance mass <b>48</b> will be moving toward the back of the tool.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">It will also be seen that the counterbalance mass <b>48</b> is extremely close to the eccentric shaft section <b>46</b>. Accordingly, even without the second counterbalance mass on the counterbalance cup <b>54</b>, the location of the first counterbalance mass <b>48</b> close to the plane of the pushrods improves counterbalancing as compared to the offset location of the prior art on the main drive gear.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">The main gear <b>30</b> is mounted on the eccentric shaft <b>22</b> on a gear shaft portion <b>50</b> adjacent to the bearing shaft portion <b>44</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">In order to provide true dynamic counterbalancing, the counterbalancing mass should be located directly opposite the eccentric shaft approximately in the plane of the pushrods <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. However, this location would produce interference between the counterbalance mass and the pushrods as the pushrods move to the rear of the tool and the counterbalance mass must move to the front of the tool. Accordingly, a second counterbalance mass <b>52</b> is located on the opposite side of the eccentric shaft and the pushrods from the first counterbalance mass <b>48</b> such that the effective counterbalancing mass acts at a point between the first and second counterbalancing masses.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">In the preferred design, the second counterbalancing mass is integrated into the counterbalance cup <b>54</b> seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. The counterbalance cup <b>54</b> includes a shaft opening <b>56</b> that extends completely through the counterbalance cup and defines an axis of rotation <b>58</b> for the counterbalance cup. The second counterbalance mass <b>52</b> is offset to one side of the axis of rotation <b>58</b> and a cup opening <b>60</b> that extends only partially through the counterbalance cup has a center <b>62</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that is offset in the opposite direction from the counterbalance mass <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">As may be seen by comparing <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref> to the cross sectional view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the counterbalance cup <b>54</b> slides onto the eccentric shaft <b>22</b>. Shaft opening <b>56</b> matches the diameter of the eccentric shaft in the region <b>64</b> while the cup opening <b>60</b> is sized to receive and engage the eccentric portion of the shaft <b>46</b> in the region marked with reference number <b>66</b>. Because the center <b>62</b> of the cup opening <b>60</b> is offset from axis <b>58</b>, the engagement between the cup opening <b>60</b> and the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b> acts to prevent the counterbalance mass <b>52</b> from rotating relative to the eccentric shaft <b>22</b>. The second counterbalance mass <b>52</b> always remains on the same side of the shaft <b>22</b> as the first counterbalance mass <b>48</b>, and that side is always opposite the side of the shaft from the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">This dual counterbalance design produces an effective dynamic counterbalancing that acts substantially opposite to the masses being driven by the eccentric motion and eliminates the wobbling motion described above. The result is to significantly reduce wear, extend the life of the drive components and increase the time the tool can be used without operator fatigue.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">It should be noted that the present invention is directed not only to the dual counterbalance dehider design of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, but also to the individual drive components for a hand held dehider comprising the eccentric shaft of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with the integrated counterbalance <b>48</b> and the counterbalance cup seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> with the integrated counterbalance mass <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">The design illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> allows the counterbalancing masses <b>48</b> and <b>52</b> to be extremely close to the plane of the pushrods and the moving masses. As a result any remaining imbalance or imbalance from subsequent wear or manufacturing variation results in a very reduced amplitude wobble as compared to prior art counterbalancing designs with a single counterbalance located far from the plane of the pushrods.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">Although the preferred embodiment is seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an alternative embodiment is seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in which one counterbalance remains on the main drive gear, as in the prior art, and a second counterbalance is located on the opposite side of the pushrods on the eccentric shaft. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, only a detailed portion of the drive mechanism is shown. The portion shown substantially corresponds to the central area showing the eccentric shaft <b>22</b> in the cross sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">However, in the design of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the counterbalance cup of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> is replaced by the prior art counterbalanced main drive gear <b>70</b> with an integrated counterbalance mass <b>72</b>. As can be seen in the enlarged view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the counterbalance mass <b>72</b> is located on one side of the main drive gear <b>70</b>. The counterbalance cup of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>, which is used in the design of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, is replaced by a simple spacer cup <b>74</b> located between the main drive gear <b>70</b> and the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b>. The spacer cup has no counterbalance mass.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">In all other respects the embodiment in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> corresponds to the embodiment in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-6</figref>. Counterbalance mass <b>48</b> on the eccentric shaft is located on the opposite side of the pushrods from the counterbalance mass <b>72</b> on the drive gear. As in the design in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, these two counterbalance masses cooperate to provide dynamic counterbalancing that acts substantially opposite the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b> in the plane of the pushrod.</p>
    <p num="p-0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows yet another embodiment of the counterbalanced drive mechanism of this invention. In this design, both of the counterbalance masses are entirely separate from the eccentric shaft. The first counterbalance mass <b>80</b> is a separate piece located below the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b> where the pushrods are connected (shown in phantom <b>82</b>). The first counterbalance mass <b>80</b> in this design is held in place by a pin <b>84</b> to prevent it from rotating around the eccentric shaft. The pin <b>84</b> ensures that the first counterbalance mass <b>80</b> always remains opposite the offset direction of the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">The first counterbalance mass <b>80</b> is removable and replaceable by disassembling the drive mechanism of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, removing pin <b>84</b> and sliding the first counterbalance mass <b>80</b> off the end of the eccentric shaft.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">The second counterbalance mass <b>72</b> is located on the main drive gear, as in the design of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, above the eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b>. The second counterbalance mass <b>72</b> is on the opposite side of the rotational axis of the eccentric shaft from the offset eccentric shaft portion <b>46</b> and on the same side of that axis as the first counterbalance mass <b>80</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">It will be understood from the various embodiments shown that the first and second counterbalance masses may be formed as part of the eccentric shaft (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), as part of the drive gear (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>), or as separate pieces, such as the counterbalance cup (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>) or the first counterbalance mass <b>80</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In each case, one counterbalance mass is located above the plane of the pushrods, and one below that plane so that the vibration due to the eccentrically driven moving mass of the tool is effectively and dynamically counterbalanced.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">In addition to the dual counterbalance feature described above, the preferred embodiment of the dehider also includes a speed governor <b>100</b> located in the handle <b>26</b>. The speed governor operates by restricting the flow of pressurized air from the air inlet <b>102</b> to the motor <b>24</b> when the motor is rotating rapidly and opening up to supply more pressurized air when the motor slows down.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the design and operation of the speed governor <b>100</b> will now be described. Pressurized air from the air inlet <b>102</b> flows into air passageway <b>104</b>. The air passageway <b>104</b> includes a valve seat <b>106</b>. Opposite the valve seat <b>106</b> is a valve head <b>108</b> that can move towards the valve seat <b>106</b>. The valve head <b>108</b> has a beveled end <b>110</b> that acts to restrict airflow through the space between the valve seat <b>106</b> and the beveled end <b>110</b>. Air that passes through the space between the valve seat <b>106</b> and the beveled end <b>110</b> eventually powers the motor <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The valve head <b>108</b> is biased to the right, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> by governor spring <b>112</b>. The governor spring <b>112</b> surrounds the core <b>116</b> and is trapped between an outwardly projecting lip <b>114</b> on the core <b>116</b> and an inwardly projecting lip <b>118</b> on the valve head <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The valve head <b>108</b> also includes an outwardly angled flange <b>120</b> that traps a plurality of governor balls <b>122</b> between the angled flange <b>120</b>, the core <b>116</b> and a governor housing <b>124</b>. The valve head <b>108</b>, core <b>116</b>, governor housing <b>124</b>, governor balls <b>122</b> and the governor spring <b>112</b> all spin with the motor <b>24</b>. As the governor balls <b>122</b> spin with the motor, centrifugal force attempts to drive them outward and up the angled flange <b>120</b> between the angled flange <b>120</b> and the governor housing <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The governor balls <b>122</b> act as a movable mass that operates the governor by centrifugal force. The outward motion of the governor balls applies a force against the angled flange <b>120</b> and the valve head <b>108</b>, which compresses the spring <b>112</b> and moves the beveled end <b>110</b> of the valve head <b>108</b> towards the valve seat <b>106</b>. The faster the motor spins, the more this valve action restricts the airflow and the less pneumatic power is supplied to the motor.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">As the dehider begins to cut and the load on the motor increases, the speed of the motor will drop. This decrease in speed will cause the centrifugal force applied by the governor balls to the valve head <b>108</b> to decrease. In turn, the spring <b>112</b> will move the valve head <b>108</b> away from the valve seat and the valve will open further, allowing more airflow. The result of increased airflow is that the motor will produce more power and will return to the original operating speed even under load.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">The governor <b>100</b> will control the speed in the manner described under significant variations in operating load. When the motor is above the desired rotational speed, the governor restricts the flow of pressurized air to decrease speed. When the motor is below the desired rotational speed, the governor opens up to increase airflow and increase the motor's speed.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">The preferred embodiment of the dehider further includes an improved cutting disk design for the cutting disk blades <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The cutting disks <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> turn on central cutting disk shaft <b>38</b>, which includes an upper bolt <b>150</b>, a lower nut <b>152</b> and a cylindrical collar <b>154</b>. The collar <b>154</b> has an outer surface <b>156</b> that acts as the bearing surface the cutting disks <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> turn on. In current dehider designs, the disk blades are of a constant thickness. However, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the strengthened cutting disks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> of this dehider have a cylindrical lip (<b>158</b> on cutting disk <b>12</b> and <b>160</b> on cutting disk <b>14</b>) that significantly increases the bearing surface between the cutting disks and the outer bearing surface <b>156</b> of the collar <b>154</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">In the preferred design, the cutting disks are produced from material that is thicker than the final thickness of the outer area of the disk, and equal in thickness to the cylindrical bearing lips <b>158</b> and <b>160</b> at the center of the disk. The disk blades are ground to reduce their thickness everywhere except at the cylindrical bearing lips <b>158</b> and <b>160</b>. Alternatively, however, the bearing lip may be added by a process such as by brazing or welding on additional material, or by deforming a thinner sheet at the inner perimeter to form the lip.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">The reduction in thickness of the disk blade in the outer area as compared to the thickness of the cylindrical lip at the center of the disk blade has two principal advantages. The first is that the weight of each cutting disk blade is reduced. This reduces the oscillating mass, which reduces wear and vibration, as well as reducing the total weight of the dehider. The second advantage is that the total thickness of the combined cutting disks <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> is reduced, which allows the cutting disks to enter the space between the carcass and the hide more easily for hide removal and improves cutting performance as compared to thicker cutting disks.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">It will be noted that the cutting disks <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are identical except that one is inverted relative to the other. The bearing lips <b>158</b>, <b>160</b> project outward at ninety degrees to the plane of their respective cutting disks. When the cutting disks are inverted and placed in back-to-back contact with each other, as illustrated, the lips <b>158</b> and <b>160</b> project in opposite directions and do not interfere with each other. The result is a substantial increase in the area of the bearing surface at the center of the tool and a substantial increase in the usable life of the cutting disks.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">The upwardly projecting bearing lip <b>158</b> on cutting disk <b>12</b> is captured inside a corresponding recess <b>162</b> in the blade cover <b>39</b>. The downwardly projecting bearing lip <b>160</b> on cutting disk <b>14</b> is captured inside a similar cylindrical recess <b>164</b> formed in the drive mechanism cover <b>37</b>. The recesses <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> also provide clearance for the cylindrical collar <b>154</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">The outward projection of the bearing lips <b>158</b> and <b>160</b>, in combination with the shape of the recesses <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> also act to prevent contaminants from entering the bearing area between the outer bearing surface of the cylindrical collar <b>154</b> and the inner bearing surface formed by the bearing lips <b>158</b> and <b>160</b> and the central openings of the cutting disks.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">Although the bearing lip design described above is most suited for handheld dehiders having oppositely oscillating cutting disk blades, it may also be implemented in dehider designs where a single cutting disk continuously rotates, where a pair of cutting disks continuously rotate in opposite directions or in dehider designs where a single blade oscillates and another blade remains still.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">While the present invention has been particularly described, in conjunction with a specific preferred embodiment, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will embrace any such alternatives, modifications and variations as falling within the true scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
