Gas stream pretreatment is accomplished in a first chamber, in fluid communication with a sump, as the gas flows through a packed bed wetted by suitable chemical reagents. After pretreatment, the gas stream is passed through downstream chambers, also utilizing wetted packed beds. These chambers are in fluid communication with a second, separate sump. Because of the first chamber/separate sump combination, influent gas treatment, by stages, can be accomplished. In this manner, different, contemporaneous chemical treatments are possible, within the single housing, with different chemical reagents utilized as needed. Such treatments are possible even in cases where otherwise incompatible chemical reagents are used. Reagents used in the first chamber are, in substantial part, recycled from the blowdown of the first chamber sump which can be augmented, if desired, by unreacted chemicals in the blowdown of the downstream sump. After treatment in the last downstream chamber, the cleaned gas flows through a demister, for moisture removal, before it is exhausted to atmosphere.</div>

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p>The present invention relates in general to control systems and methods of using them for removing unwanted constituents from fluid streams. More particularly, the present invention relates to an odor control system which operates in a more effective and efficient manner in removing unwanted odorous constituents from waste gas streams.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading> <p>The increasing concentration of population in urban settings over the past several decades has presented important environmental problems. Prominent among such problems is one presented when it becomes desirable, from a public health or aesthetic consideration, to remove unwanted odorous constituents from a gas stream, prior to its release into the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Various techniques have been developed in response to the need for odorous constituent removal. As a general rule, an effective technique should be tailored to the particular constituent to be removed.</p>
    <p>For example, in the case of odors carried by air which has been in contact with untreated sewage in pumping stations, several considerations are in order. To assess each properly, it is important to identify and characterize the odor causing constituent before attempting to develop techniques for its removal. Thus, in the sewage system environment, a primary cause of odor is hydrogen sulfide. This compound is detectable by the human olfactory sense at very low concentrations. In addition to the unpleasant odor associated with it, hydrogen sulfide is noted for its toxicity and its capacity for corroding materials with which it comes in contact.</p>
    <p>Of course, hydrogen sulfide is not the only undesirable constituent found in effluent gases. Others, such as amines, mercaptons and organic acids can be produced from a variety of sources, including rendering plants, kraft pulp plants, paint and coating operations and oil refineries. Because of the undesirability of introducing such undesirable constituents into the atmosphere, communities and governmental agencies have formulated criteria for their regulation. A suitable odor control system, meeting such criteria, would substantially reduce the likelihood of any public nuisance or annoyance by removing, in a cost effective manner, substantial amounts of unwanted substances, preferably at or near the source of their production.</p>
    <p>Removal of odorous constituents from a waste gas stream can be accomplished by several techniques. In general, conventional odor control systems can be divided into five major classes as follows:</p>
    <p>A. Incineration. In this technique, thermal oxidation occurs when the temperature of the gas stream is elevated to a level at which compounds burn in the presence of oxygen derived from the atmosphere or from the stream containing the odorous constituents. High temperatures are required. Although this technique is effective in controlling odor to almost any desirable level, fuel costs are generally high, even when heat recovery methods are employed.</p>
    <p>Thus, although incineration is suitable for some applications, it is not generally the technique of choice in many odor control applications.</p>
    <p>B. Adsorption. This comprises a process in which gaseous constituents are trapped and oxidized on the surface of a solid. Commonly used sorbents are activated charcoal and carbon. In general, systems utilizing adsorption are easy to operate and sometimes desirable because no liquid waste is produced. However, because frequent regeneration of the sorbent is required, adsorptive systems are not generally desirable as a primary odor control system.</p>
    <p>C. Dilution. In this technique, odorous gas is mixed with enough fresh air to reduce odor concentration below a threshold level. Such a technique is not acceptable, at least in some applications, because unacceptably large volumes of fresh air would be required to achieve a desired level of odor control.</p>
    <p>D. Masking. Odor modification or masking is a method in which a pleasant odor is superimposed on an unpleasant one. The technique is based on the premise that a person perceives a mixture of smells as a single odor. Masking is impractical for odor control at stations where large volumes of odor contaminated air are being discharged.</p>
    <p>E. Absorption. Absorption, or chemical oxidation, is a process in which odorous compounds in a gas stream are transferred into a liquid solution and are chemically oxidized in the liquid phase. In general, a liquid solution of chemical reagents is used.</p>
    <p>In some cases, the absorption method, utilizing chemical reaction and oxidation, is the technique of choice because of cost considerations, especially when large gas volumes having relatively low concentrations of odorous compounds are involved. In general, the technique is utilized in a mass transfer system conventionally known as a scrubber.</p>
    <p>In scrubber systems utilizing the absorption method, reaction between chemical treating agents and the odorous constituents takes place in the liquid phase. Removal efficiency depends on the transfer rate of the compounds from air into liquid. This, in turn, is dependent on mass transfer coefficient and total interfacial surface area. Such considerations drive scrubber design.</p>
    <p>Several conventional scrubber systems exist for bringing chemical reagents into contact with an air stream bearing odorous compounds. Such systems include packed towers, spray/mist chambers, Venturis and impingement tray towers.</p>
    <p>A conventional chemical treatment and oxidation scrubber currently in widespread use is a scrubber utilizing a packed tower with a fan for exhausting odors from a contaminated area. Often, such a scrubber comprises a large cylindrical tower having random packing irrigated by a recirculating reagent solution from a liquid sump located below the packing. The random packing, as opposed to structured packing, is used to maximize surface contact between the gas undergoing treatment and the reactant liquid. In such a system, odorous gas is passed through the unit and contacted with the recirculating liquid stream in a counter-current fashion. Odorous constituents are absorbed into the liquid where they react with chemicals added to the recirculating liquid. The treated gas exits at the top of the scrubber and by-product reactants are accumulated in the liquid in the sump until purged from the system by a blowdown stream.</p>
    <p>In some cases, scrubbers utilizing packed towers are added as a retro-fit project in response to neighbor or employee complaints. In other cases, of course, such systems are contemplated in the initial design of a facility and are erected during facility construction. In either case, a typical packed tower system presents significant height and floor space requirements. In other words, such systems often have a “footprint” which is substantially greater than one might wish.</p>
    <p>For example, a typical 15,000 cfm packed tower system for a municipal wastewater treatment plant requires more than 20 feet of height clearance and, with ancillary equipment, occupies approximately 400 square feet of floor space. Thus, it is apparent that such conventional systems, although having substantial utility, impose a large sacrifice of expensive facility space and volume. The problem is compounded when a plurality of packed towers is required, either because of the nature of the unwanted substances in the gas being treated or because reaction products formed within one packed tower must, in turn, be treated or neutralized in another tower before release to atmosphere.</p>
    <p>In view of the aforementioned limitations of conventional odor control systems, it would be desirable to have a system for effective treatment of odorous gases which would eliminate the necessity of dedicating large portions of a facility to the system.</p>
    <p>In addition to the expensive and undesirable space penalties presented by conventional systems, other problems are presented by the necessity of purchasing and installing ancillary equipment. Typical scrubbers utilize one or more packed towers, each of which requires, for its operation, recirculating pumps, exhaust fans, chemical metering pumps, liquid monitors and chemical storage. These components are generally assembled at the site of erection of the scrubbing system and must by wired or plumbed into the system. In the usual case, they substantially increase the size of the footprint of the scrubber and their cost can sometimes equal or exceed the capital cost of the equipment, especially when installation costs are considered.</p>
    <p>In cold climates, it is sometimes necessary to insulate or provide suitable enclosures for the ancillary equipment, thereby again increasing installation and operating costs. In view of these considerations, it would be very desirable to have an odor control system which would reduce substantially the costs of installing and operating ancillary equipment. Ideally, such a system would have operating efficiencies at least equal to those of conventional systems while substantially reducing installation costs and the size of the system footprint.</p>
    <p>Another significant problem with conventional packed towers is plugging of the packing as a result of accumulation of solids. Such accumulations can quickly lead to reduced system efficiency. Plugging may be caused by a variety of operational parameters such as hardness of make-up water, the chemical reagents utilized, and system pH. It is generally recognized that plugging can be effectively reduced or eliminated by purging the system. In the purging process, an amount of the recirculation stream, together with an equal or greater amount of the by-product salts created and added to the system, must be constantly removed from the sump to prevent the accumulation of solids and resultant plugging. Fresh make-up water and new chemical reagent must be added to replace the purge stream.</p>
    <p>However, a major concern in consideration of system purge rate is the cost of unreacted chemical reagent which is sent to the drain during the purging process. Over time, this cost can make system operation prohibitively expensive. The alternative, an inefficient, plugged system, is also unacceptable. The dichotomy presented by the desire to have a smoothly operating system on the one hand and conserving chemical reagent on the other hand, can cause friction among system managers where one may desire high purge rates (and reduced maintenance costs) while another would opt for reducing chemical reagent costs by utilizing low purge rates.</p>
    <p>In view of the foregoing, it would indeed be desirable to have an odor control system in which packed tower purging could be accomplished with a significant reduction in reagent waste. Such a system would result in a significant reduction in the large footprint of conventional systems, would reduce or eliminate some of the problems presented by installation and operation of ancillary equipment, and would provide a method of packed tower purging that would permit suitable purge rates while reducing the amount of wasted reagent. Such a desirable odor control system would substantially lower operating costs by maximizing reagent utilization.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The principal object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved odor control system, and method of using it, for removing unwanted substances from waste gases while optimizing chemical utilization.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved odor control system which, compared to such conventional systems, operates at substantially reduced costs.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide an odor control system which is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and easily installed, requiring little maintenance.</p>
    <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved odor control system in which the gas treating components are located in a single housing.</p>
    <p>It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved odor control system in a compact arrangement of components to conserve the facility area required for its installation.</p>
    <p>It is still another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved odor control system having the capability of multiple stages and multiple chemistries in a single housing. In this regard, conventional chemicals, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid, can be efficiently utilized. Moreover, because of the novel design of the present invention, otherwise incompatible chemicals, requiring dramatically different pH conditions to function, can be utilized contemporaneously in a once through process. Thus, for example, sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide may be used at the same time for a particular scrubber operation.</p>
    <p>It is an even still further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved odor control system which can be factory assembled and tested, prior to delivery to the job site.</p>
    <p>It is still another object of the present invention to provide an odor control system having a lower height and substantially smaller footprint than conventional odor control systems.</p>
    <p>Briefly, the above and further objects of the present invention are realized by providing an odor control system and method for removing unwanted odorous airborne constituents in which the gas stream is flowed through a compact, boxlike housing having a plurality of sequentially communicating treatment chambers. Gas stream pretreatment is accomplished in a first chamber, in fluid communication with a sump, as the gas flows through a packed bed wetted by suitable chemical reagents. After pretreatment, the gas stream is passed through downstream chambers, also utilizing wetted packed beds. These chambers are in fluid communication with a second, separate sump. Because of the first chamber/separate sump combination, influent gas treatment, by stages, can be accomplished. In this manner, different, contemporaneous chemical treatments are possible, within the single housing, with different chemical reagents utilized as needed. Such treatments are possible even in cases where otherwise incompatible chemical reagents are used. Reagents used in the first chamber are, in substantial part, recycled from the first chamber sump. These reagents are augmented by unreacted chemicals from the blowdown of the downstream sump. After treatment in the last downstream chamber, the cleaned gas flows through a demister, for moisture removal, before it is exhausted to atmosphere.</p>
    <p>The odor control system of the present invention provides several distinct advantages. First, the boxlike geometry permits mounting of metering and recirculating pumps, oxidation reduction potential controls and pH controls on the system itself. Secondly, the boxlike construction permits use of vertical seal less pumps instead of the horizontal, centrifugal pumps used in conventional systems. As a result of this improvement, suction piping, mechanical seals and water for the seals are eliminated and space requirements for pumps are significantly reduced as are costs related to mechanical seal replacement. Further, the smaller footprint of the present invention affords a lower system height while permitting multiple stages and multiple chemistries. In addition, the construction of the present invention allows 25% to 50% more throughput of contaminated air, as compared to conventional odor control systems.</p>
    <p>Still further advantages of the present invention relate to a novel use of a purge stream prior to discharge of the stream into the drain, thereby increasing chemical utilization. As a result of this feature, maintenance costs are reduced since higher purge rates can be used in view of increased chemical utilization. Also, the use of low cost chemicals, such as caustic, in the pretreatment stage, in combination with the use of the purge stream, further reduces operating costs. In addition, the present invention is so flexible that it permits, in the same apparatus, use of low energy packing to remove easily removable substances (such as ammonia) and high performance (high energy) packing for removal of more difficult substances (such as mercaptans).</p>
    <p>In view of the foregoing, it can be seen that the present invention significantly reduces chemical cost, during the lifetime of the system, by recovering unreacted chemical and recycling it through the gas pretreatment stage. In this regard, significant annual savings can be realized when compared to operating costs of conventional odor control systems.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of the present invention is that it utilizes rectangular geometry in which system components are fit into a very compact boxlike structure, thereby requiring significantly less facility area. Another advantageous aspect of the system design is seen in the fact that a significant reduction in system plumbing and ducting can be accomplished, thereby reducing installation costs and substantially eliminating problems of leakage.</p>
    <p>Still another advantage of the present invention is that, by virtue of its unitary construction, the odor control system can be factory assembled, piped, wired and tested, thereby eliminating the expense and inconvenience of field assembly and thereby reducing installation costs and providing a more easily maintained and more aesthetically pleasing system.</p>
    <p>Yet still another advantage of the present invention is that it has increased flexibility and reduced operating costs, as compared to conventional odor control systems, by virtue of having multiple stages within a single housing.</p>
    <p>Yet still another advantage of the present invention is that it is capable of multiple chemistries, thereby increasing system flexibility and reducing operating costs.</p>
    <p>In summary, the odor control system of the present invention is a 3-stage, single-pass system capable of automatic operation with automatic chemical injection, but also capable of manual operation. The system comprises a complete package of unitary construction, preassembled, piped, wired, and factory tested and including a scrubber, demister, fan, metering and recirculation pumps and controls. The customer needs only to provide foul air ducting, concrete pad, electrical power, properly softened water supply, drain and chemical storage tanks.</p>

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Referring now to the drawings and, more particularly to FIG. 1 thereof, there is shown a new odor control system <b>10</b> which is constructed in accordance with the present invention. The system <b>10</b> receives waste gases, bearing unwanted odorous constituents, from such sources as semiconductor process plants, kraft pulp plants, paint and coating operations, oil refineries and municipal wastewater treatment plants. The gas stream may carry hydrogen sulfide, acidic gases or other substances either hazardous to human health or unacceptable to people in the vicinity of the gas producing source.</p>
    <p>In copending patent application Ser. No. 08/232,203, there is disclosed a novel emergency scrubbing system which has utility in removing explosively released gases, such as chlorine gas, from a gas stream. This emergency scrubber is boxlike in design having three sequentially connected treatment chambers disposed over a common sump. Chemical reagents sprayed into the chlorine gas react therewith and reaction products, together with unreacted chemical reagents, fall into a common sump. During operation of the emergency scrubbing system, the gas flowing therethrough reverses direction several times thereby increasing the dwell time in the system and helping to produce excellent system performance.</p>
    <p>In the system <b>10</b> of the present invention, a boxlike housing <b>14</b> is also utilized. It contains three sequentially connected treatment chambers and, as the gas stream flows through the system <b>10</b>, it changes direction three times. In typical system <b>10</b> operation, a pretreatment stage occurs in an inlet chamber <b>16</b> where the gas stream passes through a packed bed <b>36</b> which has been wetted with chemical reagents.</p>
    <p>After pretreatment in the inlet chamber <b>16</b> is accomplished, the gas stream flows through another packed bed <b>44</b> in an intermediate chamber <b>18</b>, thence through yet another packed bed <b>48</b> located in an outlet chamber <b>22</b>. A second sump <b>32</b>, separated from the sump <b>28</b>, but in fluid communication therewith, is located beneath the chambers <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>. Once again, a surplusage of reagents can be utilized to wet the packed beds <b>44</b> and <b>48</b> since the unreacted portion thereof are collected in the sump <b>32</b>. These reagents are transferred to the sump <b>28</b> for recirculation through the packed bed <b>36</b>. In this novel manner, waste of unreacted chemical is significantly reduced and, in some cases, it is virtually eliminated. As a result, substantial cost savings are realized in comparison to conventional single step odor control systems.</p>
    <p>With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the housing <b>14</b> of the system <b>10</b> includes a bottom wall <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, a top wall <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, side walls <b>14</b> <i>c </i>and <b>14</b> <i>d</i>, a front wall <b>14</b> <i>e </i>and a back wall <b>14</b> <i>f</i>. An interior wall <b>42</b> separates the inlet chamber <b>16</b> from an intermediate chamber <b>18</b> while another interior wall <b>46</b> separates the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> and the outlet chamber <b>22</b>. It will be noted that the wall <b>42</b>, while it does not extend to the top wall <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, does extend between the inlet chamber <b>16</b> and the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> to contact the bottom wall <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, thereby defining, together with portions of the side wall <b>14</b> <i>c</i>, back wall <b>14</b> <i>f </i>and front wall <b>14</b> <i>e</i>, the sump <b>28</b>. In like manner, the interior wall <b>46</b>, together with the side wall <b>14</b> <i>d</i>, back wall <b>14</b> <i>f</i>, front wall <b>14</b> <i>e </i>and bottom wall <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, defines a second sump <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p>After the gas stream has been pretreated, it flows into the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> where, once again it is flowed through a wetted packed bed <b>44</b> before it flows out of the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> and into the outlet chamber <b>22</b>. The third packed bed <b>48</b>, similarly wetted with suitable chemical reagents is utilized in the outlet chamber <b>22</b>. As noted beneath the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> and the outlet chamber <b>22</b> is the common sump <b>32</b> which is separated from the sump <b>28</b> by the wall <b>42</b>. Here again, a surplusage of chemical reagents can be used since unreacted reagents fall into the sump <b>32</b> where, by virtue of an overflow conduit <b>39</b> the unreacted reagents in the sump <b>32</b> can be flowed into the sump <b>28</b> for recirculation through the packed bed <b>36</b>. Liquid flow through the overflow conduit <b>39</b> can be controlled by an amount of make up water to the sump <b>32</b>. As desired, liquids may be drained from the sump <b>28</b> through a drain <b>26</b>, controlled by a valve <b>27</b>. A sump overflow pipe <b>29</b>, in fluid communication with the drain <b>26</b>, can be used to maintain a suitable liquid level in the sump <b>28</b>. A drain <b>31</b> can be utilized for draining the sump <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p>Considering now FIGS. 1 and 2 in greater detail, a waste gas stream flowing under pressure in a manner designated generally by the arrows M, enters the system <b>10</b> at an inlet <b>33</b> of a fan <b>34</b>. The fan <b>34</b> rests on a shelf <b>35</b> which is supported in a conventional manner. The fan <b>34</b>, connected in fluid communication with the inlet chamber <b>16</b> by a duct <b>41</b>, drives the gas stream along the course M through the system <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Pretreatment of the gas stream occurs in the inlet chamber <b>16</b>. The packed bed <b>36</b>, used to maximize surface contact between odorous gas constituents and reactant liquids, is wetted by chemical reagents delivered through a nozzle <b>38</b> (FIG. <b>2</b>). The nozzle <b>38</b> is preferably made of Teflon, polypropylene or PVC having a full cone, wide angle non-clog construction. It is fluidly connected to a riser <b>58</b> by a header <b>59</b>.</p>
    <p>The packing media utilized for packing of the bed <b>36</b>, whether the bed is structured or random, is typically polypropylene or PVC which are generally resistant to the corrosive attack of acids, alkali and bleach solutions. Different packing media can be utilized in the odor control system of the present invention to optimize removal of different gas stream components. For example, ammonia is very easily neutralized with acid. Thus, a low energy (low pressure drop) packing can be used while other components, such as mercaptans, require very high energy packing media for effective removal.</p>
    <p>During system <b>10</b> operation, the gas stream, after passing countercurrently through the packed bed <b>36</b>, flows over the wall <b>42</b>. After the pretreatment stage in the inlet chamber <b>16</b> is completed, the gas stream, following the arrow M, exits the inlet chamber <b>16</b> by flowing over the wall <b>42</b> whereupon it enters the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> for further chemical treatment. The packed bed <b>44</b> in the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> and the packed bed <b>48</b> in the outlet chamber <b>22</b> are similar in function and construction to the packed bed <b>36</b> and each also contains suitable packing. The packed bed <b>48</b> is wetted through a nozzle <b>66</b> which, in turn, is fed by a header <b>68</b> while the packed bed <b>44</b> is wetted by a nozzle <b>71</b> receiving solution through a header <b>73</b>. The headers <b>68</b> and <b>73</b> connect to flanges <b>77</b> and <b>75</b> respectively, each being mounted on the front wall <b>14</b> <i>e </i>in a manner similar to the flange <b>61</b>.</p>
    <p>In the intermediate chamber <b>18</b>, the packed bed <b>44</b>, having packing media wetted by suitable chemical reagents, is utilized for further treatment, in a cocurrent manner. After passing through the packed bed <b>44</b>, the gas stream M flows downwardly and under the wall <b>46</b>.</p>
    <p>In the outlet chamber <b>22</b>, the gas stream M flows upwardly through the packed bed <b>48</b>, then through a mist eliminator <b>52</b> from whence it is discharged through a stack <b>24</b> to atmosphere. The mist eliminator <b>52</b> is generally constructed of polypropylene, PVC, thermoplastic, or fiberglass. It is capable of removing virtually all droplets greater than 40 microns in diameter.</p>
    <p>During gas stream M cleaning, the sump <b>28</b> contains an aqueous solution <b>54</b> of suitable chemical reagents, including chemical reagents from the sump <b>32</b>. This solution <b>54</b> is pumped, by a recirculating pump <b>56</b> through the riser <b>58</b> for delivery to the packed bed <b>36</b>. The recirculation pump <b>56</b> is a seal-less, vertical, centrifugal type pump of CPVC or FRP construction for corrosion resistance and long service life. The pump is suitable for solutions over a broad pH range. It is mounted for easy service on the shelf <b>35</b> in a conventional manner. An overflow drain <b>65</b> is utilized for removal of reaction products from the sump <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>In the intermediate chamber <b>18</b>, the gas flows cocurrently through the packed bed <b>44</b>. As the gas flows through the packed bed <b>48</b>, chemical reactions, based on mass transport principles occur and reactions products, unreacted chemicals and water flow downwardly into the sump <b>32</b> which is located beneath the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> and the outlet chamber <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>A metering pump <b>62</b>, also mounted on the shelf <b>35</b>, may be utilized to introduce fresh chemical in addition to blowdown of unreacted chemical from the sump <b>32</b> flowing through the riser <b>58</b>. Riser pressure is displayed on the gauge <b>64</b>. The riser <b>58</b> is connected to the flange <b>61</b> at the outer wall <b>14</b> <i>e </i>at a height above the location of the packed bed <b>36</b>. The header <b>59</b> is reversibly connected to the riser <b>58</b> at the flange <b>61</b>.</p>
    <p>With regard now to gas stream treatment, in the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> and in the outlet chamber <b>22</b>, a recirculating pump <b>83</b>, similar in function and construction to the pump <b>56</b> is mounted on the shelf <b>35</b> to pump solution through the riser <b>87</b>. A pair of metering pumps <b>84</b> and <b>85</b> identical in construction and function to the pump <b>62</b>, is disposed on the self <b>35</b>. The pumps <b>84</b> and <b>85</b> are utilized to control the amount of fresh reagent added to the aqueous solution <b>72</b> flowing through the riser <b>87</b>. Riser pressure is displayed on a gauge <b>64</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>The partition wall <b>46</b> separates the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> from the outlet chamber <b>22</b>. The wall <b>46</b> does not extend into the sump <b>32</b>, which contains an aqueous solution <b>72</b>, so that the gas stream is permitted to flow under the partition <b>46</b> and thence upwardly through the outlet chamber <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>The gas undergoing treatment in the outlet chamber <b>22</b> is treated in a countercurrent manner and, upon exiting the packed bed <b>48</b>, it flows through the mist eliminator <b>52</b> and as cleaned gas, is exhausted to atmosphere. It will be noted by reference to FIG. 1, that the riser <b>87</b>, controlled by a valve <b>88</b>, is capable of carrying reagents and aqueous solution of chemicals to a place above the mist eliminator <b>52</b>. In this manner, the mist eliminator can be washed with suitable solutions as deemed necessary.</p>
    <p>Considering now a chemical feed and dilution subsystem <b>23</b> in greater detail with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the subsystem is comprised of recirculating pumps, metering pumps and liquid distribution risers and nozzles. The subsystem <b>23</b> permits delivery of reagents such as sodium hydroxide and/or sodium hypochlorite to the spray nozzles <b>38</b>, <b>71</b> and <b>66</b> where the chemical solution is circulated through the packed beds <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, and <b>48</b> respectively.</p>
    <p>The metering pumps <b>62</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>85</b> are positive displacement, diaphragm type chemical metering pumps which, in normal operation, typically deliver 50% sodium hydroxide and/or 12.5% sodium hypochlorite solution to the packed beds.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>, there is shown an odor control system <b>20</b> which is another embodiment of the present invention. Many of the components of the system <b>20</b> are identical in construction, location and function to their respective counterparts in the system <b>10</b>, as depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2.</p>
    <p>Thus, for convenience, such components in the odor control system <b>20</b> will use the same reference numerals as those used for their counterparts shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 but the numerals will be preceded by “1”. Thus, for example, the inlet chamber <b>116</b> of FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b> is identical to the inlet chamber <b>16</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>. Further, the discussion of the structure, location and function of such counterparts will not be repeated but is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>, it will be noted that a mist eliminator <b>211</b> is located adjacent of the inlet chamber <b>116</b>. The mist eliminator <b>211</b> provides great flexibility with regard to selection of chemical reagents for use in the system <b>20</b>. For example, the mist eliminator can prevent acid carryover from the inlet chamber <b>116</b> into the downstream chambers. Thus, gas steam treatment with sulfuric acid under highly acidic conditions can be accomplished in the inlet chamber <b>116</b> while alkaline reagents are being utilized in the downstream chambers. In this manner, a highly efficient and effective gas stream treatment can be realized in a once through process.</p>
    <p>In the system <b>20</b>, the sump <b>132</b> has a drain <b>215</b> controlled by a valve <b>217</b>. An overflow pipe <b>218</b> fluidly connects the sump <b>132</b> with the drain <b>215</b>.</p>
    <p>With reference now to FIG. 5, the riser <b>187</b> communicates with a header <b>231</b> for delivery of liquid to a nozzle <b>233</b> for spraying the mist eliminator <b>152</b> with a cleaning substance, if desired. Liquid flow to the nozzle is controlled by a valve <b>234</b>.</p>
    <p>Some of the above mentioned novel capabilities of the separate sump/separate chambers of the odor control systems <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be illustrated by the following Examples.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE I</heading> <p>When it is desirable to remove hydrogen sulfide from a gas stream, sodium hydroxide, (caustic) and sodium hypochlorite (bleach) can be applied to the packed beds of the intermediate and outlet chambers. Unreacted bleach and caustic, collected in the downstream sump <b>32</b> can be recirculated through the packed bed <b>36</b> in the inlet chamber <b>16</b>. Thus an effective scrubbing operation is realized while chemical usage is reduced.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE II</heading> <p>Conventional scrubbers utilize sodium hydroxide for hydrogen sulfide removal and generally function at about 80% efficiency. Sodium hydroxide is the reagent of choice, in such scrubbers, because it costs less than 10% of the cost of sodium hypoclorite. By utilizing the odor control systems <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> of the present invention, sodium hydroxide is applied to the packed bed <b>36</b>, in the inlet chamber <b>16</b>, thereby removing 80% of the hydrogen sulfide at about 10% of the cost of using bleach. Subsequently, the remaining hydrogen sulfide is removed, in the intermediate chamber <b>18</b> and in the outlet chamber <b>22</b>, as sodium hypochlorite and sodium hydroxide are applied to the packed beds <b>44</b> and <b>48</b>, respectively. Thus again, an effective operation is achieved with significant economies in chemical usage, especially in the case of the more expensive sodium hypochlorite.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE III</heading> <p>In a case when it is desirable to remove ammonia or amines from a gas stream, a chemical reagent of choice is often sulfuric acid which reacts optimally at low pH. This presents problems for conventional odor control systems since the caustic substances and bleaches, useful for removal of reduced sulfides, can only function at elevated pH.</p>
    <p>By utilizing the odor control system <b>20</b> of the present invention, the problems seen in conventional systems are solved. In this case, the sumps <b>128</b> and <b>132</b> are kept separate. Sulfuric acid is used to wet the packed bed <b>136</b>. In this manner, the pH within the inlet chamber <b>116</b> is substantially lowered and salts such as ammonium sulfate are by-product reactants. These reactants are removed continually through the overflow <b>129</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>).</p>
    <p>Sulfuric acid carryover from the inlet chamber <b>116</b> is prevented by the mist eliminator <b>211</b>. The gas stream M flows from the mist eliminator and through the downstream chambers where caustic and bleach can be applied. Thus, while unreacted chemicals can still be recirculated, there is no carryover from the sump <b>128</b> to the packed bed <b>144</b>. In this manner, chemical treatments at a strongly acid pH and at a highly alkaline pH can be accomplished, in a novel manner, within the single housing <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>While preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various modification may be made in these embodiments without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For that reason, the scope of the invention is set forth in the following claims.</p>
