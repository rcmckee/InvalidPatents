The embodiments monitor the flow of data within the control application during events (i.e., transactions, stages, process steps, etc.). By comparing a dataflow path for a near real-time event with historical dataflow path records, dataflow interruptions (i.e., fails) within the control application can be detected. By determining the location of such a dataflow interruption, the root cause of the control application fail can be determined. Additionally, the invention can generate summary reports indicating the status of the control application. These summary reports can further be generated with drill downs to provide a user with direct access to the records upon which the reports were based.</div>

<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is related to the following co-pending applications, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/839,689 filed Aug. 16, 2007, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/839,796 filed Aug. 16, 2007, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/839,749 filed Aug. 16, 2007. The complete disclosures of these related co-pending applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">The embodiments of the invention generally relate to control applications and, more particularly, to a system and method for monitoring and reporting the status of a control application, such as a fault detection and classification application, in an automated manufacturing environment.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Advanced process control (APC) applications are increasingly used in conjunction with manufacturing technology to improve metrics, such as yield, costs, mean time between failures, etc. For example, fault detection and classification (FDC) applications use models to collect and monitor data regarding tool and/or process parameters in order to provide an early warning of tool and/or process faults and, thereby, to avoid having to scrap wafers or entire lots of wafers. However, it is often difficult to identify when a control application has failed or what the root cause of such a control application failure might be. Specifically, it is often difficult to monitor and quantify the effectiveness and performance of a control application in real-time.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p num="p-0007">In view of the foregoing, disclosed herein are embodiments of a system, method, and service that provide near real-time monitoring of a control application in a manufacturing environment in order to detect and determine the root cause of faults within the control application. The embodiments monitor the flow of data within a control application during certain events (i.e., certain transactions, stages, process steps, etc.). By comparing a dataflow path for a near real-time event with historical dataflow path records, dataflow interruptions (i.e., fails) within the control application can be detected. By determining the location of such a dataflow interruption, the root cause of the control application fail can be determined. Additionally, the invention can generate summary reports indicating the status of the control application (e.g., over a given period of time). These summary reports can, for example, quantify the performance of the control application (e.g., by indicating a percentage of events during a given period of time for which the control application should have collected data and failed) and/or quantify the effectiveness of the control application (e.g., by indicating a percentage of the events during a given period of time for which the control application had inhibit ability). Additionally, these summary reports can be generated with drill downs to provide a user with direct access to the records upon which the reports were based.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">More specifically, disclosed herein is an embodiment of a system for monitoring an advanced process control (APC) application (e.g., an fault detection and classification (FDC) application). The system embodiment can comprise a data retriever adapted to access a plurality of identified data sources (e.g., data logs and databases) for the control application. The data retriever can further be adapted to retrieve, from those data sources, all relevant data regarding selected events (i.e., regarding selected transactions, stages or process steps, such as selected wafer-chamber passes). That is, each time a selected event (e.g., a selected wafer-chamber pass) occurs on a new item (e.g., a wafer) being manufactured, the data retriever will collect data that is associated with that selected event and that is stored in the data sources of the control application.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">The system embodiment can further comprise a data compiler adapted to compile this data in order to generate records of dataflow paths within the control application for specific events. Event dataflow path records can be time-stamped and stored by the data compiler on a data storage device.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">The system embodiment can further comprise a records analyzer adapted to perform an analysis of the records (e.g., in response to a specific query and/or automatically in response to a continual query) in order to detect any dataflow interruptions within the control application. Specifically, a comparison between a dataflow path record for a current event (i.e., a near real-time event) and historical dataflow path records (i.e., dataflow path records of prior events of the same type) can be performed by the analyzer to detect a dataflow interruption. The analyzer can further be adapted to determine the locations of each of the detected dataflow interruptions. Based on the location of a dataflow interruption, the control application failure can be classified.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">The system embodiment can further comprise a summary report generator and a graphical user interface (GUI). This summary report generator can be adapted to generate a summary report indicating the status of the control application (e.g., over a given period of time), based on the records. More particularly, the summary report can be generated based on the above-described analysis of the records. The GUI can be used to display the report. For example, the summary report generator can be adapted to generate a summary report that quantifies the performance of the control application (i.e., How well did the control application perform its functions?) and/or the effectiveness of the control application (What is the effective coverage of the control application?). In order to quantify the performance of the control application, the summary report can comprise the following entries: an entry that specifies the total number of events, an entry that specifies the number of events covered by a control application model, an entry that specifies the number of broken arrows, an entry that specifies the percentage of broken arrows, etc. In order to quantify the effectiveness of the control application, the summary report can comprise the following entries: an entry that specifies the total number of events, an entry that specifies the number of events covered by control application models, an entry that specifies the best-case percentage of control application coverage, an entry that specifies the number of events covered by control application models where the control application had inhibit ability, an entry that specifies the current percentage of coverage by control application models, etc. Quantification of performance and/or effectiveness of the control application can be based on some user-specified or default grouping (e.g., in wafer processing the grouping can be by tool type, by technology, by technology center, by chamber, by recipe, etc.)</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Additionally, the summary report generator can be adapted to generate the summary report with drill down functions. Such drill down functions can be used to allow a user to link via the GUI to the records upon which the different line items in the summary report are based.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Also disclosed herein are embodiments of a method and an associated service for monitoring an advanced process control (APC) application, such as a fault detection and classification (FDC) application. Generally, the method embodiments can comprise identifying and accessing a plurality of data sources (e.g., data logs and databases) for the control application. The method can further comprise retrieving, from those data sources, all relevant data regarding selected events (i.e., data regarding selected transactions, stages, process steps or the like within the manufacturing environment, such as wafer-chamber passes). That is, each time a selected event occurs (e.g., each time a selected wafer-chamber pass is performed on a new wafer) all relevant data that is associated with the selected event and that is stored by the control application in its data sources will be collected. The method can further comprise compiling this data in order to generate records of dataflow paths within the control application for specific events. Event dataflow path records can be time-stamped and stored on a data storage device.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">The method can further comprise performing an analysis of the dataflow path records (e.g., in response to a specific query and/or automatically in response to a continual query) in order to detect any dataflow interruptions within the control application. Specifically, the process of analyzing the records can comprise performing a comparison between a dataflow path record of a current event (i.e., a near real-time event) and historical dataflow path records (i.e., the dataflow path records of prior events of the same type) to detect a dataflow interruption. The process of analyzing the records can further comprise analyzing the dataflow path records to determine the location of each dataflow interruption. Based on the location of the dataflow interruption, the control application failure can be classified. Notification (e.g., reports, alarms, etc.) can be provided to users of such control application failures and their root causes.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In addition to detecting control application failures and determining the root causes of those failures, the method can comprise generating summary reports indicating the status of the control application (e.g., over a given period of time), based on the analysis of the records, and outputting or displaying (e.g., on a graphical user interface (GUI)) the summary reports. For example, each summary report can quantify the performance and/or the effectiveness of the control application over a given time period, as discussed above. Also, as discussed above, the summary report can be generated according to some grouping (e.g., in wafer processing the grouping can be by tool type, by technology, by technology center, etc.). Furthermore, each summary report can be generated with drill down functions allowing a user to link directly to the dataflow path records, upon which the report was based, using the GUI.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">Finally, also disclosed are embodiments of a program storage device readable by computer and tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the computer to perform the above-described method of monitoring a control application.</p>

It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.

Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">In view of the foregoing, disclosed herein are embodiments of a system, method, and service that provide near real-time monitoring of a control application in a manufacturing environment in order to detect and determine the root cause of faults within the control application. Specifically, the embodiments monitor dataflow within a control application during certain events (i.e., certain transactions, stages, process steps, etc.) occurring in the manufacturing environment. A comparison of the dataflow path for a current event with the historical dataflow path records can be used to detect dataflow interruptions (i.e., fails) within the control application. The location of such a dataflow interruption can in turn be used to determine the root cause of the control application fail. Additionally, the system and method can generate summary reports indicating the status of the control application (e.g., over a given period of time), based on the analysis of the records. These summary reports can, for example, quantify the performance of the control application (e.g., by indicating a percentage of events during a given period of time for which the control application should have collected data and failed) and/or quantify the effectiveness of the control application (e.g., by indicating a percentage of the events during a given period of time for which the control application had inhibit). These summary reports can further be generated with drill downs providing a user with direct access to the records upon which the reports were based.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">More specifically, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, disclosed herein is an embodiment of a system <b>100</b> for monitoring an advanced process control (APC) application (e.g., a fault detection and classification (FDC) application, a run-to-run (R2R) application, a model predictive control (MPC) application, sensor control and feedback application, etc.). Such APC applications generally collect data in a manufacturing environment and act (e.g., generate reports, provide warnings, etc.) based on that data in order to improve metrics, such as yield, costs, mean time between failures, etc. Thus, associated with each control application are data sources containing both raw and summary data.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">For example, the system embodiment <b>100</b> can monitor a fault detection and classification (FDC) application that uses sensors and models to collect and monitor tool and/or process parameter data in an integrated circuit manufacturing environment in order to provide summary reports and early warnings of tool and/or process faults and, thereby, to avoid having to scrap wafers or entire lots of wafers.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">The system embodiment <b>100</b> can comprise a data retriever <b>102</b> in communication with and adapted to access a plurality of previously identified data sources <b>10</b> associated with the control application. The data sources <b>10</b> can comprise, for example, data logs and/or database containing data (e.g., logistic data, raw data, summary data, etc.) acquired by the control application during the manufacturing process. The data logs and/or databases can be stored within storage devices of the various components of the control application and/or within a central data warehouse (e.g., a distributed manufacturing information warehouse (DMIW)). Data sources <b>10</b> associated with the control application can include, but are not limited to, the following: data sources <b>11</b> containing information from the machines supervisory program (MSP) which provides a code interface between the tools and the manufacturing execution system (MES); data sources <b>12</b> containing information about the various tools used during events (i.e., transactions, stages, process steps, etc.) occurring in the manufacturing environment; data sources <b>13</b> containing information about the various recipes used in the manufacturing environment; data sources <b>14</b> containing information about the control application models used in the manufacturing environment; and data sources <b>15</b> containing stored output (e.g., sensor records, statistical process and control (SPC) charts, etc.) of the control application in response to the different events that occur within the manufacturing environment and that are covered by control application models.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">For example, if the manufacturing process is an integrated circuit manufacturing process and if the control application is a fault detection and classification (FDC) application which uses statistical process control (SPC) techniques, the output data <b>15</b> of the FDC application can be entries on SPC charts, in which sensor data from the various manufacturing tools is recorded during a given wafer-chamber pass. A wafer-chamber pass (i.e., a recipe-wafer-chamber pass) refers to each time a single wafer is placed in a chamber and processed within that chamber by one or more tools according to one or more recipe-specific steps.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">The data retriever <b>102</b> can further be adapted to retrieve, from those data sources <b>10</b>, all relevant data regarding selected events (i.e., regarding selected transactions, stages or process steps that occur during the manufacturing process, e.g., selected wafer-chamber passes that occur during wafer processing). That is, each time a selected event (e.g., a selected wafer-chamber pass) occurs on a new item (e.g., a wafer) being manufactured, the data retriever <b>102</b> will collect data that is associated with that selected event and that is stored in the various data sources <b>10</b> of the control application.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">The system embodiment <b>100</b> can further comprise a data compiler <b>104</b> in communication with the data retriever <b>102</b> and adapted to compile this data in order to generate records <b>105</b> of dataflow paths within the control application for specific events. For example, the dataflow path records can show that every time a specific event occurs (e.g., each time a given wafer-chamber pass is performed on a new wafer), the same postings are made to the same data sources. Event dataflow path records can be time-stamped and stored by the data compiler <b>104</b> in a data storage device <b>106</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">The system embodiment <b>100</b> can further comprise a records analyzer <b>108</b> in communication with the storage device <b>106</b> and adapted to access the records <b>105</b>. The analyzer <b>108</b> is further adapted to perform an analysis of the records <b>105</b> (e.g., in response to a specific query and/or automatically in response to a continual query) in order to detect any dataflow interruptions within the control application. Specifically, a comparison between a dataflow path record for a current event (i.e., a near real-time event) and historical dataflow path records for prior events of the same type previously stored in the in storage <b>106</b> can be performed by the analyzer <b>108</b> to detect a dataflow interruption. That is, such a comparison can be used to detect an interruption in the known dataflow path for that event type, as established based on the historical records stored in the data storage device. For example, if the current event is a specific wafer-chamber pass known to have control application model coverage and if, in the past, this same wafer-chamber pass resulted in the posting of certain data to a data source (e.g., a SPC chart), then no such posting indicates that a dataflow interruption has occurred and, thus, an control application failure has occurred.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">The analyzer <b>108</b> can further be adapted to determine the location within the control application of each dataflow interruption. Based on the location of the dataflow interruption, the control application failure can be classified. That is, a determination can be made by the analyzer <b>108</b> as to the root cause of the failure (e.g., a recipe error, model error, missing control chart, etc.). For example, in a given control application the dataflow path may be linear with data posting at different data sources sequentially (i.e., with data posting at one data source, then the next, and so on in succession). For example, in an exemplary FDC application the dataflow path may be from a machine supervisory program (MSP) to a process station for data acquisition (PSDA) to a multivariate analysis engine (e.g., MAE) to a disperser, to an SPC chart, etc. Since the flow of data is linear, failure of the data to post at a given data source will indicate that the failure has occurred upstream as opposed to downstream. While the control application dataflow path, discussed above is linear, non-linear (i.e., branching) control application dataflow paths are also anticipated and those skilled in the art will recognize that various logic applications can similarly be developed to determine the location of the dataflow interruption in such non-linear paths.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">The system embodiment <b>100</b> can further a means by which a user can be automatically notified of a detected control application failure and, optionally, its location. For example, the system can be adapted to send automatically generated emails, sound alarms, etc., in order to notify a user of a detected control application failure.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">The system embodiment <b>100</b> can further comprise a graphical user interface (GUI) <b>112</b> as well as a summary report generator <b>110</b> in communication with the analyzer <b>108</b>, the data storage device <b>106</b> and the GUI <b>112</b>. This summary report generator <b>110</b> can be adapted to tally up various numbers within the records <b>105</b> in order to generate summary reports <b>111</b> indicating the status of the control application (e.g., over a given period of time), based on the analysis of the records. Such summary reports <b>111</b> can be stored in the data storage <b>106</b>. The GUI <b>112</b> can be used to display the summary reports <b>111</b> automatically or in response to user queries. Specifically, the summary report generator <b>110</b> can, for example, be adapted to generate a summary report <b>111</b> that quantifies, for a given time period, the performance of the control application (i.e., How well did the control application perform its functions?) and/or the effectiveness of the control application (What is the effective coverage of the control application?).</p>
  <p num="p-0041">Quantification of performance and/or effectiveness of the control application can be for a specified period of time and based on some user-specified or default grouping (e.g., by technology type, by tool type, by technology center, by chamber, by model, by recipe, etc.) as specified in a user query.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">For example, in integrated circuit manufacturing, one such grouping can be by technology type. Technology type can be defined as an aggregate of processes that define the manufacturing process (e.g., in integrated circuit manufacturing, 300 mm technology refers to processing of 300 mm wafers, 90 nm technology refers to wafer processing during which the minimum gate width is 90 nm, etc.). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides a table illustrating an exemplary summary report <b>200</b> by technology type <b>210</b> (300 mm technology) over a given time period <b>215</b> (Jun. 2, 2007-Jun. 8, 2007), where column <b>220</b> specifies different technologies within the 300 mm technology type (e.g., 130 nm Logic, 90 nm Logic, 45 nm Logic, etc.).</p>
  <p num="p-0043">Another grouping in integrated circuit manufacturing can be by tool type. Tool type can be defined as a collection of tools that perform a similar process, for example, reactive ion etch (RIE) tools contain both plasma etch and plasma strip tools. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides a table illustrating an exemplary summary report <b>300</b> by tool type <b>310</b> over a given time period <b>315</b> (Jun. 2, 2007-Jun. 8, 2007), where column <b>320</b> specifies the different tools by tool identification number (ID) and where each of the identified tools, in this case, is within a given back end of the line reactive ion etch (BEOL_RIE) tool type (i.e., a tool type that performs back end of the line (BEOL) reactive ion etch (RIE) processes).</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Yet another grouping in integrated circuit manufacturing can be by technology center. Technology center can be defined as a collection of process type (e.g., rapid thermal processing (RTP), ion implantation (ION), chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), metal film deposition (MTL), insulator deposition (INS), wet clean processing (WET), plating (PLT), reactive ion etching (RIE), furnace (FRN), etc. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides a table illustrating an exemplary summary report <b>400</b> by technology center <b>410</b> over a given time period <b>415</b> (Jun. 2, 2007-Jun. 8, 2007), where column <b>420</b> specifies different processes used.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">In order to quantify the performance of the control application, the summary report can comprise, for example, the following entries, for each row beginning with a technology, tool or technology center entry in the first column (see columns <b>220</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>320</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>420</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>): (1) an entry that specifies the total number of events performed in that technology, by that tool, with that process, during the given period of time (see columns <b>225</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>325</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>425</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); (2) an entry that specifies the number of events covered by control application models (see columns <b>230</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>330</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>430</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); (3) an entry that specifies the number of broken arrows (i.e., the number of events performed in that technology, by that tool or with that process, during the given time period, for which the control application should have collected data and failed); and/or (4) an entry that specifies the percentage of broken arrows (i.e., the percentage of events performed in that technology, by that tool or with that process, during the given period of time, for which the control application should have collected data and failed over the total number of events that occurred during that same time period, see columns <b>250</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>350</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>450</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">In order to quantify the effectiveness of the control application, the summary report can comprise, for example, the following entries, for each row beginning with a technology, tool or technology center entry in the first column (see columns <b>220</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>320</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>420</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>): (1) an entry that specifies the total number of events performed in technology, by that tool or with that process, during the given period of time (see columns <b>225</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>325</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>425</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); (2) an entry that specifies the number of events covered by control application models (see columns <b>230</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>330</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>430</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); (3) an entry that specifies the best-case percentage of control application coverage (i.e., an entry that specifies the percentage of events covered by control application models out of the total number of events, see columns <b>235</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>335</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>435</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); (4) an entry that specifies the number of events covered by control application models where the control application had inhibit ability (see columns <b>240</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>340</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>440</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); and/or (5) an entry that specifies the current percentage of coverage by control application models (i.e., the percentage of events during a given period of time for which the control application had inhibit ability out of the total number of events, see columns <b>255</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>355</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <b>455</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), etc. Inhibit ability refers to the control applications ability to stop (i.e., inhibit) the process if a fail is detected (i.e., if a determination is made by an FDC application that a given tool or process is outside set parameters).</p>
  <p num="p-0047">Additionally, the summary report generator <b>110</b> can be adapted to generate summary reports with drill down functions. Such drill down functions can be multi-tiered and can be used to allow a user to link via the graphical user interface to the records upon which the different line items in each summary report are based. That is, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the various entries may be selected providing additional details regarding, status, errors, performance and coverage.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">For example, from a tool type summary report a user may select a specific Tool ID (e.g., JJ05) in order to pull up the table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> breaks down the total number of wafer chamber passes performed by tool ID JJ05, according to different recipe-tool-chamber combinations. That is, each row identifies the number of wafer-chamber passes performed by tool ID JJ05, using the same recipe-tool-chamber combination. The first row of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a recipe-tool-chamber combination in which the recipe is new such that there is no comparison data for broken arrow identification. However, the third row of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a recipe-tool-chamber combination resulting in a broken arrow (i.e., an error). From the table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a user may select the specific recipe-tool-chamber that resulted in an error (i.e., row <b>3</b>) in order to pull up the table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> breaks down each of the wafer-chamber passes that were performed using the error producing recipe-tool-chamber combination of row <b>3</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by wafers. From the table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a user may select an individual wafer (e.g., 90K01F3PKOF2) in order to pull up the table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> provides the root cause details of the error relative to that individual wafer.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, also disclosed herein are embodiments of a method for monitoring an advanced process control (APC) application (e.g., a fault detection and classification (FDC) application, a run-to-run (R2R) application, a model predictive control (MPC) application, sensor control and feedback application, etc.) that collects data in a manufacturing environment and acts based on that data in order to improve metrics, such as yield, costs, mean time between failures, etc. Specifically, a broad embodiment of the method can comprise identifying and accessing a plurality of data sources for the control application (<b>802</b>). The data sources can comprise, for example, data logs and/or databases containing data (e.g., logistic data, raw data, summary data, etc.) acquired by the control application during the manufacturing process. These data logs and/or databases can be stored within storage devices of the various components of the control application and/or within a central data warehouse (e.g., a distributed manufacturing information warehouse (DMIW)). The data sources associated with the control application can include, but are not limited to, the following: data sources containing information from a machines supervisory program (MSP) which provides a code interface between the manufacturing tools and the manufacturing execution system (MES) (<b>803</b>); data sources containing information about the various tools used during events (i.e., transactions, stages, process steps, etc.) occurring in the manufacturing environment) (<b>804</b>); data sources containing information about the various recipes used in the manufacturing environment (<b>805</b>); data sources containing information about the control application models used in the manufacturing environment (<b>806</b>); and data sources containing stored outputs of the control application (e.g., sensor records, statistical process and control (SPC) charts, etc.) following events that occurs within the manufacturing environment and that are covered by control application models (<b>807</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0050">The method can further comprise retrieving, from those data sources, all relevant data regarding selected events (i.e., data regarding selected transactions, stages, process steps or the like within the manufacturing environment, such as wafer-chamber passes) (<b>808</b>). That is, each time a selected event occurs (i.e., each time the transaction is performed on a new item, such as a wafer, being manufactured) data that is associated with the selected event and that is stored by the control application in its data sources will be collected.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">The method can further comprise compiling this data in order to generate records of dataflow paths within the control application for specific events (<b>810</b>). These dataflow path records can show that every time a specific event occurs, the same postings are made to the same data sources. Event dataflow path records can be time-stamped and stored on a data storage device. (<b>812</b>)</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The method can further comprise performing an analysis of the dataflow path records (e.g., in response to a specific query and/or automatically in response to a continual query) in order to detect any dataflow interruptions within the control application (<b>814</b>). Specifically, the process of analyzing the records can comprise performing a comparison between a dataflow path record of a current event (i.e., a near real-time event) and historical dataflow path records (i.e., the dataflow path records of prior events of the same type) to detect a dataflow interruption. That is, such a comparison can be used to detect any interruption in the known dataflow path for that event type, as established based on the historical records stored in the data storage device. For example, if a given event is known to have control application coverage and if, in the past, this same event resulted in the posting of certain data to the data sources, then no such posting indicates that a dataflow interruption has occurred and, thus, indicates that a control application failure has occurred. The process of analyzing the records can further comprise analyzing the dataflow path records to determine the location of each dataflow interruption. Based on the location of the dataflow interruption, the control application failure can be classified. That is, a determination can be made as to the root cause of the failure (e.g., a recipe error, model error, missing control chart, etc.). Notification (e.g., reports, alarms, etc.) can be provided to users of such control application failures and their root causes (<b>816</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0053">In addition to detecting control application failures and determining the root causes of those failures, the method can comprise generating a summary report indicating the status of the control application (e.g., over a given period of time), based on the analysis of the records, and outputting or displaying (e.g., on a graphical user interface (GUI)) the summary report (<b>818</b>). This summary report can, for example, quantify the performance (<b>819</b>) and/or the effectiveness (<b>820</b>) of the control application.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">As discussed in detail above and illustrated in the exemplary summary reports of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the process of generating the summary report can comprise quantifying the performance of the control application by providing in the report one or more entries that reflect how well the control application performed its functions and/or quantifying the effectiveness of the control application by providing in the report one or more entries that reflect the coverage of the control application. Also as discussed in detail above and illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the summary report can be generated according to some grouping (e.g., by tool type, by technology, by technology center, etc.) (<b>821</b>). Furthermore, the summary report can be generated with drill down functions allowing a user to link directly to the dataflow path records, upon which the report is based, using a graphical user interface (GUI) (<b>822</b>-<b>823</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a more narrow embodiment of the method can specifically monitor a fault detection and classification (FDC) application that uses models to collect and monitor tool and/or process parameter data in an integrated circuit manufacturing environment in order to provide an early warning of tool and/or process faults and, thereby, to avoid having to scrap wafers or entire lots of wafers.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">This embodiment can similarly comprise identifying and accessing a plurality of data sources for the FDC application (<b>902</b>). The data sources can comprise, for example, data logs and/or databases containing data (e.g., logistic data, raw data, summary data, etc.) acquired by the FDC application during wafer processing. The data logs and/or databases can be stored within storage devices of the various components of the FDC application and/or within a central database (e.g., a distributed manufacturing information warehouse (DMIW)). The data sources associated with the FDC application can include, but are not limited to, the following: data sources containing information from a machines supervisory program (MSP) which provides a code interface between the manufacturing tools and the manufacturing execution system (MES) (<b>903</b>); data sources containing information about the various tools used during wafer-chamber passes (<b>904</b>); data sources containing information about the various recipes used during wafer-chamber passes (<b>905</b>); data sources containing information about the FDC models (<b>906</b>); and data sources containing stored output of the FDC application (<b>907</b>). Specifically, if the FDC application uses statistical process control (SPC) techniques, the output of the FDC application can be SPC charts, in which sensor data from manufacturing tools used during a given wafer-chamber pass is recorded. As mentioned above, a wafer-chamber pass (i.e., a recipe-wafer-chamber pass) refers to each time a single wafer is placed in a chamber and processed within that chamber by one or more tools according to one or more recipe-specific steps.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">This embodiment can further comprise retrieving, from those data sources, all relevant data regarding selected wafer-chamber passes (<b>908</b>). That is, each time a selected wafer-chamber pass is performed on a new wafer, data that is associated with the selected event and that is stored will be collected from the data sources of the FDC application.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">This embodiment can further comprise compiling the collected data in order to generate records of dataflow paths within the FDC application for specific wafer-chamber passes (<b>910</b>). These dataflow path records can show that every time a specific wafer-chamber pass is performed on a new wafer, the same postings are made to the same SPC chart. Event dataflow path records can be stored on a data storage device.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">This embodiment can further comprise performing an analysis of the dataflow path records (e.g., in response to a specific query and/or automatically in response to a continual query) in order to detect a dataflow interruption within the FDC application (<b>914</b>). Specifically, the process of analyzing the records can comprise performing a comparison between a dataflow path record of a current wafer-chamber pass (i.e., a near real-time wafer-chamber pass) and historical dataflow path records for the same wafer-chamber pass to detect a dataflow interruption. That is, such a comparison can be used to detect an interruption in the known dataflow path for that specific wafer-chamber pass, as established based on the records stored in the data storage device. More specifically, if a specific wafer-chamber pass is known to have FDC model coverage and if, in the past, that same wafer-chamber pass resulted in the posting of certain data to a SPC chart, then no such posting indicates that a dataflow interruption has occurred and, thus, indicates that an FDC application failure has occurred. The process of analyzing the records can further comprise analyzing the dataflow path records to determine the location of the FDC application failure. Based on the location of the dataflow interruption, the FDC failure can be classified. That is, a determination can be made as to the root cause of the FDC failure (e.g., a recipe error, model error, missing control chart, etc.). Notification (e.g., reports, alarms, etc.) can be provided to users of such FDC application failures and their root causes (<b>916</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0060">In addition to detecting FDC application failures and determining the root causes of those failures, the method can comprise generating a summary report indicating the status of the fault detection and classification application (e.g., over a given period of time), based on the analysis of the records, and outputting or displaying (e.g., on a graphical user interface (GUI)) the summary report (<b>918</b>).

  <p num="p-0071">Therefore, disclosed above are embodiments of the invention that provide near real-time monitoring of a control application in a manufacturing environment in order to detect and determine the root cause of faults within the control application. The embodiments monitor the flow of data within a control application during certain events (i.e., certain transactions, stages, process steps, etc.). By comparing a dataflow path for a near real-time event with historical dataflow path records, dataflow interruptions (i.e., fails) within the control application can be detected. By determining the location of such a dataflow interruption, the root cause of the control application fail can be determined. Additionally, the invention can generate summary reports indicating the status of the control application (e.g., over a given period of time), based on the analysis of the records. For example, the summary reports can quantify the performance of the control application (e.g., by indicating a percentage of events during a given period of time for which the control application should have collected data and failed) and/or can quantify the effectiveness of the control application (e.g., by indicating a percentage of the events during a given period of time for which the control application had inhibit ability). These summary reports can further be generated with drill downs to provide a user with direct access to the records upon which the reports were based.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">The information made available to users by the disclosed embodiments (i.e., control application failure notices, root cause of failure notices, summary reports and drill downs) will allow users to act in order to ultimately improve yield and enhance productivity. For example, this information may precipitate rerouting of products to different tool types or technology centers with control application coverage. Identification of tools with control application coverage and maximizing use of such tools will minimizes scrap events. The information will allow users to act in order to optimize equipment utilization. That is, the information may be used to track tool performance and availability statistics for production control and management and further to make production decisions, such as fab loading decisions.
