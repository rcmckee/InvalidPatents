    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">The present invention is a continuation of and claims the benefit and priority of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/293,005, filed on Dec. 2, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,882,258, entitled System, Method, and Computer Readable Medium for Creating A Video Clip, which is related to and claims the benefit and priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/632,410, filed on Dec. 2, 2004 now abandoned, entitled Picture To Video (Pic-2-Vid) In Internet Commerce and which is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/773,130, filed on Feb. 5, 2004, entitled System And Method For Assembling And Distributing Multi-Media Output, which is related to and claims the benefit and priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/445,261 filed on Feb. 5, 2003, entitled System And Method For Generating A Unified File Name. The entire contents of each of the above noted patent applications are enclosed by reference herein.</p>
    <heading>FILED OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention is generally related to video, and more specifically, to a system, method, and computer readable medium for creating a video clip. The present invention relates generally to multi-media content and, more specifically, to a system and method for assembling and distributing multi-media output. The present invention also relates generally to multi-media content and more specifically, to a system, method, and computer-readable medium for assembling and distributing multi-media output.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">The transcoding of pictures to video is a known technique that includes U.S. Pat. No. 6,195,503 that describes the transformation of compressed images and audio into video. Also, video editing using server Internet tools, including the transcoding and rendering of pictures into video is known. However, a limitation exists for using pictures as a tool for Internet commerce. Almost all sites for selling and buying items on the Internet use simple pictures as the main tool for explaining, demonstrating and educating customers about these items. Pictures are simple to take and use. Further, pictures do not use complex editing tools and processing power and do not require a high level of expertise to either take, process, or deliver.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">It would be very beneficial if improved systems, methods, and computer readable media are devised which allow better options to convey pertinent information while using the same pictures that are used today.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Large numbers of organizations are producing and making use of video, audio, flash animation, HTML and pictures collectively known as Multi Media Content (MMC). There is also an abundant amount of video and audio in analog format (such as tapes) which are typically converted to digital format. Another major source of MMC is commercial material produced by the entertainment (movie studios) and broadcasting industry (TV), as well as individuals using camcorders. Most of the MMC is distributed on CD's and DVD's. Production of such media is costly and distribution via the mail system is time consuming.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">An alternative to DVD's and CD's is electronic distribution that can be accomplished via a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), using TCP/IP via a public network (the Internet), or via an internal system (Intranet). Other means of distribution are wireless such as microwave, a cellular network, and a WI-FL network, for example. However, MMC content, (especially video) typically comprised large files, and distributing such content electronically can be very expensive, time consuming, and in many cases, simply impossible due to the limited capacity of the receiving device.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Trading, licensing and selling of MMC by commercial providers (such as movie studios, TV networks, sport channels, etc.) is cumbersome since the providers may consider the content to be proprietary and may find it difficult to prevent a receiver of the content from creating multiply copies.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Progressive download, widely known as Streaming Media (a client-server system), is an excellent solution since the encoding process reduces the original file size by 80-90%. Upon request, the server sends a small amount of data (“Buffering”). As soon as the buffering is completed the receiving device starts the play back while the process of downloading and decoding occurs in the background, often times simultaneously. The process of encoding MMC to a streaming format, however, is cumbersome, time consuming, and requires significant technical expertise as the user has to select a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, the nature of TCP/IP and a secured network, block the user from direct accesses to the operating system and file storage process. A separate process of uploading is required and the final stage of storage and indexing for retrieval must be done by authorized personnel (for example, a system administrator).</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Other issues that prevent wide use of MMC content include:</p>
    <p num="p-0011">1. Once the MMC is uploaded it cannot be changed—any change requires creation of a new file (rendering) and repeating the upload process;</p>
    <p num="p-0012">2. Streaming video can be played within flash and HTML but there is no way to tell what and when the receiving device will play each component since the buffering time can change randomly; and</p>
    <p num="p-0013">3. There are many types of receiving devices using many communication protocols, players and streaming technology. Distributing MMC in streaming format also enables the MMC provider to license the use of content without proprietary concern since the progressive download process prevents it. However, establishing a commerce platform for licensing and trading MMC requires an agreed upon protocol and a large, centralized database to monitor the transactions. Many attempts to do so have failed. It is therefore desirable for the present invention to overcome the aforementioned problems and limitations associated with multi-media output.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0014">The present invention provides a system, method, and computer readable medium for creating a video clip. In one embodiment, a method, comprising creating a copy of a still image by a first module, the copy of the still image comprising reduced dimensions of the still image, creating a new still image from a selected area of the still image, automatically ordering the new still image and the copy of the still image, creating an audio file by at least one of a second module and a third module, creating a timeline, by the first module, related to the ordered images and the created audio file, and rendering the timeline into a video clip by a fourth module, wherein the timeline includes a length of the audio file, a length of the video clip, the ordered images, a display time of each of the ordered images, transition identifiers, transition lengths.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">In another embodiment, a system for creating a video clip comprises a device configured to create an audio file, and a web server configured to create a copy of a still image, a new still image from a selected area of the still image, wherein the new still image and the copy of the still image are automatically ordered, and a time line related to the ordered images and the created audio file, wherein the time line includes a length of the audio file.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">In a further embodiment, a computer readable medium comprises creating a copy of a still image by the first module, the copy of the still image comprising reduced dimensions of the still image, creating a new still image from a selected area of the still image, automatically ordering the new still image and the copy of the still image, creating an audio file by at least one of a second module and a third module, creating a timeline, by the first module, related to the ordered images and the created audio, and rendering the timeline into a video clip by a fourth module, wherein the timeline includes a length of the audio file, an identifier of the audio file created by the second module or the third module, or a volume envelope associated with the audio file.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">The present invention also achieves technical advantages as a system, method and computer-readable medium for assembling and distributing multi-media output. Various embodiments of the present invention are noted below:</p>
    <p num="p-0018">1. Allow any user a simple method of encoding and uploading. This can be done by setting pre-defined “profiles” containing specific parameters for encoding, indexing, sorting and uploading any type of MMC. The profiles can be created by a system administrator, for example, and stored on a server. The user computing device automatically downloads these profiles.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">2. The user is able to select any type of content. The system is able to allocate the right encoding and compressing process for each type of content. Setting the content attributes, indexing and encoding are done on the user's computing device. The uploaded MMC will then be much smaller than the original MMC thus saving significant upload time. Since the MMC has been identified, described and indexed, the content can be automatically directed to the right storage device. Retrieval by indexing, attribute and key word search is enabled. Once stored on the server, the content can be instantly edited by selecting entry and exit points for the streaming server.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">3. The user can also select separate files and/or segments to be played together as one show (“movie making”).</p>
    <p num="p-0021">4. Allow the user to add voice to the MMC by means of a telephone, cellular phone, microphone and other similar devices. The user is able to play the voice over while the MMC is played or as an introduction before the MMC. The user should also be able to control the volume setting of the audio channels.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">5. The user is able to mix and integrate different types of MMC such as video, audio, animation and pictures instantly and without rendering a new file. Since the system stores only the instruction sets and the server produces the edited clips, made-up movies and customized production, (on the fly), only a fraction of the storage capacity is required. The server creates Multi Media Presentations (MMP) that are displayed using HTML based platform and Multi Media Messaging (MMS) that are displayed directly on the device (for example, wireless devices such as cell phones).</p>
    <p num="p-0023">6. Organizations are able to create and store pre-defined templates allowing their users to change the MMC content, add text, animation and voice over as needed.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">7. The user is able to distribute the MMC in many format such as:</p>
    <p num="p-0025">E-mail with a link to the message in HTML format (Vid-Mail);</p>
    <p num="p-0026">Independent web site;</p>
    <p num="p-0027">Embedded object in a web site;</p>
    <p num="p-0028">Multi Media Message (MMS) to cell phone and wireless devices; and</p>
    <p num="p-0029">On line instant messaging systems.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">8. Security and access level is built into the system such that user access to the MMC is controlled. Security features are enabled for the MMS and MMP as well such that certain clips will not play for unauthorized viewers.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">9. The system has the ability to automatically attach other MMC to any MMP and MMS such as advertisement and sponsors' messages. This process is known as “wrapping” and can be done on random basis or triggered by external parameters (such as demographic targeted wrappers).</p>
    <p num="p-0032">10. The integration and execution of commands between different media types (such as streaming and flash) can be controlled and modified even after the publication. Viewers can interfere with the control system via a computing device or any telephone.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">11. The system permits copying and sharing content between different project and storage devices based on the user's access level.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">12. Allow for search and retrieval of MMC based on a unique identifier, indexing system and keyword search. The search and retrieval is machine independent and does not require any specific database and/or synchronization.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">13. By defining commerce criteria, such as pricing, duration of license and time limits, one can offer the MMC for trade without copying and downloading the MMC (thus protecting intellectual properties). The process of such trade is independent—one can define the terms of commerce and exchange confirmation without any predefined protocol and/or centralized system.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">14. Using the MMP and MMS command set stored on the server or on the user's computer, a new file can be rendered in the background. The new file is seamless, contains all the elements of MMP or MMS, and can include special effect, transitions, embedded text etc. The rendered file can be stored on the server as a new MMC. The rendered file can also be sent via MMS or downloaded to the user.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">15. The command set can be sent directly to any video editing as a “story board”. The editing system is automatically loading the right clips at the right places and times for the video editor to complete the editing process. A tremendous amount of time is saved and the communication between the parties is much more effective.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">In one embodiment, is a system for assembling and distributing multi-media output which comprises: a rendering server; a web server; and storage, wherein the servers and the storage are operably coupled; the storage adapted to receive digital media and properties of the media, store the media and the properties, and transmit the media and the properties; the web server adapted to perform at least one of a following action: retrieve the media and properties of the media; manipulate the media and the properties; assemble the properties; and transmit at least one of a following element from a group consisting of: the properties; and the assembled properties; the rendering server adapted to receive commands from the web server. In another embodiment is a method for creating a unified file name, which comprises: assigning a unique identifier based on a destination of a file; assigning a code based on a type of the file after the unique identifier; assigning a code based on a user defined category after the code based on the file type; assigning a code based on a user defined sub-category after the code based on the user defined category; assigning a code related to at least one of: a creator of the file; and a creator of a content of the file, after the code based on the user defined sub-category; and assigning a creation date of at least one of: the creator of the file; and the creator of the content of the file, after the previously assigned code.

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0088">The present invention describes a process of creating video clips from any given set of digital pictures and of creating an audio track in either an automatic mode or a manual mode that is interchangeable. The pictures are provided as a set of Universal Resource Locators (URL's, pointing to one or more servers), uploaded manually or created on line by cropping and saving many pictures from one source. The audio track can be created from several sources including:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0088">Interactive Voice Response (IVR)—using any telephone system the user can call into a computer based telephony application that calls a WMA encoder;</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0089">Text-To-Speech (TTS)—a TTS module can be used to convert text to speech;</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0090">Microphone—connected to a client device which records a voice file on the server; and</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0091">Existing audio file—usually pre-recorded audio such as music or sound effects.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0089">In manual mode, a preview module synchronizes a visual display (play-list) and an audio track for instant replay. a rendering server receives a command set (or SIS Commands) from a mixer or a predefined set of rules (in automatic mode) and creates a video file in .WMV format, for example. An embedded player recognizes the existence of the .WMV file and plays the video thus eliminating the need to post new HTML code.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">The present invention further describes processing and delivering pictures made to video in a secure manner for use in commerce, such as for use in Internet commerce. Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system <b>10</b> of the present invention comprises a first module (such as a web server <b>14</b>), at least one of: a second module (such as a TTS engine) <b>16</b> and a third module (such as an IVR engine) <b>18</b>, a fourth module (such as a rendering server) <b>20</b>, a fifth module (such as a media steaming server) <b>22</b>, and memory (not shown). The system <b>10</b> is accessed by a user device <b>12</b> such as a computer, cellular phone, and/or any wireless or wired device capable of communicating with the system <b>10</b>. The user device <b>12</b> is coupled to the fist module <b>14</b>, which is coupled to the second module and/or the third module directly or via the memory. The first module <b>14</b> is coupled to the fourth module <b>20</b> and is optionally coupled to the fifth module <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, a lesser or greater number of modules can be used and the functionality performed by the current invention can be performed by these lesser or greater number of modules without departing from the scope of the present invention. Also, the connections between the modules may be wired, wireless, and a combination of wired and wireless.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">Editing Process</p>
    <p num="p-0092">In one embodiment of the invention, the user uploads images (pictures), preferably in compressed format (such as JPEG) to a dedicated server for editing and transcoding from pictures and audio tracks to video, preferably WMV. A main portion of the invention is the editing process. Instead of transforming the pictures to video and then editing, the software of the present invention prepares (edits) the video using the original pictures and the original sound track (audio). This method allows for very simple editing that is extremely light in processing power. The editing process, as will be explained later, does not require the actual transcoding process to take place until the editing is completed and the editing instructions are summarized in a special command file (a SIS Command) using special command language. Instead of requiring several multiple servers dedicated to the editing process (because the requirement for processing power), the system uses fewer and lighter processing engines. This method also allows a streamlining of the transcoding process (transforming the pictures and associated audio to actual video). Once the user finishes editing the pictures and associated audio, the file containing the instructions on how to use the pictures and audio in the transcoding process are queued for the transcoding process. This achieves two main goals: (1) very efficient use of the transcoding engine, which typically requires most of the processing power, as files are processed only once, and (2) the files are queued (video encoding) in real time on their way to their final destination (the streaming server) as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">In one embodiment of the present invention, the system uses two players, one for audio and one for pictures. The editing process is premised on creating synchronization points between the two multimedia files (as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). In one instance, the pictures are displayed evenly in time according to the length of the audio file. For example, if there are 10 pictures to be transformed to video and the length of the audio file is 45 seconds, then each picture will be displayed for approximately 4.5 seconds. In another instance, the user (who created the video) can decide on different allocations of times to each picture based on the content of the audio file. This can be done either interactively (the user clicks the mouse for example when it desires a transition to the next picture) or by setting manually the time allocation—in percentages for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">In another embodiment of the present invention, the audio track for the video is obtained using a telephone. The user calls a number, dials in an identification number of work in progress, and the server digitizes and compresses the incoming “audio track” in preparation for the editing process. In yet another variant of the invention, the audio track is uploaded from the user's computer where he/she digitizes the audio locally.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">Text-To-Speech</p>
    <p num="p-0096">In another embodiment of the invention, which can be used in many other applications (beyond Internet commerce), TTS is integrated into the system. This is important for both occasional users as well as aggregators (aggregators assist clients who are large sellers (Power Sellers) selling large quantities of items). The occasional user can benefit from TTS because it provides a professional sounding voice to the video (and the user can choose from a variety of voice options). The aggregator (and by extension his customers) can benefit from TTS because it can automatically create large amounts of sound tracks for many video clips (without the need for human interaction).</p>
    <p num="p-0097">In a further embodiment of the invention, every picture has its associated TTS and the switch to a next picture is performed when the paragraph is over. In yet another embodiment of the current invention, the user can inject quiet periods when needed in order to keep a picture with short text on the screen longer. Likewise, the user can also include music or any other external audio clips to supplement the final video.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">Focal Points</p>
    <p num="p-0099">In yet another element of the present invention, the high resolution of available pictures allow the user to use a much higher quality video by using what are referred to as focal points. In many cases a single picture contains several objects that can be listed on sale. For example, a user may want to sell 10 tools and he created a single high resolution picture of all 10 tools. By using 10 focal points on the image (for example, selecting the focal points by clicks of the mouse), the software of the current invention can create the following: (1) 10 different pictures, and (2) a “real” video in which the “camera” is fluidly moving from one object to the next. This is especially useful when there are connections from one object to the next. A user can add pop-up messages and possibly associated text to help in the “selling” process.

    <p num="p-0101">One of the best ways to sell on the Internet is by using high quality pictures. These pictures often take a great deal of effort to create. Unfortunately, once the pictures are on the Internet they are easy to copy and use. There are no good methods to protect pictures. In one embodiment of the invention, the pictures are transformed to video to facilitate protection. There are many video formats that support DRM (Digital Rights Management) which provides the protection of the pictures that the user worked hard to create. In one embodiment of the invention WMV with its DRM system is used for picture protection.</p>
