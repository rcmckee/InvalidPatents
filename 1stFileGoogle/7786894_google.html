<heading>CONTRACTUAL ORIGIN OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This invention was made with government support under Contract Number DE-AC07-05ID14517 awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.</p>
<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p num="p-0003">This application is related to copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/572,141, filed Oct. 1, 2009, which is a divisional of this application.</p>
  <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0004">This invention relates to sensing systems in general and more specifically to methods, apparatus, and systems for monitoring transmission systems.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0005">Transmission systems, such as pipelines, cell towers and electrical power transmission systems, can be damaged in a variety of ways, including damage by weather, by accidents, and by intentional sabotage, just to name a few. Of course, many elements of such transmission systems are often located in remote areas where monitoring of the systems may be quite difficult, dangerous, and expensive. However, damage to these transmission systems can result in even more costly and extensive repairs. For example, damage to multiple towers of an electrical power transmission system could cause cascading or “rolling” blackouts.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Early notification of damage to a transmission system can provide several benefits. If a transmission system operator is informed that an event is forthcoming then the operator can follow a procedure for mitigating the consequences of that event. For electrical power transmission systems, for example, an operator could take steps to localize the problem, thus minimizing or preventing the occurrence of cascading blackouts. Additionally, if an operator is informed that an event, such as intentional sabotage, is happening at a given location, the operator can alert local law enforcement authorities so that the intruder may be captured. Monitoring of transmission systems may also provide an opportunity for enhancing security or monitoring of remote locations, such as border areas.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0007">One embodiment of a sensing platform for monitoring a transmission system may comprise a sensor that senses one or more conditions relating to a condition of the transmission system and/or the condition of an environment around the transmission system. A control system operatively associated with the sensor produces output data based on an output signal produced by the sensor. A transmitter operatively associated with the control system transmits the output data from the control system.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">A system for monitoring a transmission system may comprise a plurality of sensing platforms operatively associated with the transmission system at a corresponding plurality of locations along the transmission system. Each sensing platform may include a sensor that senses one or more conditions of the transmission system, a control system that produces output data based on output signals from the sensor, and a transceiver that transmits the output data from the control system. At least one endpoint receiver receives the output data transmitted by a sensing platform.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">A method for monitoring a transmission system may involve the steps of: Sensing one or more conditions of the transmission system and/or an environment around the transmission system, and transmitting data related to the sensed condition.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0017">One embodiment of a monitoring system <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as it may be used to monitor a portion, or even substantially the entirety, of a transmission system <b>12</b>. By way of example, in one embodiment, the transmission system <b>12</b> may comprise an electrical power transmission system <b>38</b>, although the invention may be used with other types of transmission systems as well. Briefly, the monitoring system <b>10</b> may comprise a plurality of individual sensing platforms <b>14</b> provided at various locations <b>16</b> along the transmission system <b>12</b>. Monitoring system <b>10</b> may also comprise at least one endpoint receiver <b>18</b>. Endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may be positioned so that it receives information <b>20</b> transmitted by at least one of the plurality of sensing platforms <b>14</b>. In the embodiment shown and described herein, endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may be operatively associated with a user interface system <b>22</b>, such as, for example, a personal computer, to allow a user (not shown) to interpret and/or act on the information <b>20</b> received by endpoint receiver <b>18</b>. In addition, and as will be described in greater detail below, user interface system <b>22</b> may also allow the user to transmit information or programming instructions to the various sensing platforms <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">Referring now primarily to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, each sensing platform <b>14</b> may be identical to the others (although this need not be the case), and may comprise a chassis or housing <b>24</b> sized to receive the various components and subsystems comprising the individual sensing platform <b>14</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the sensing platform <b>14</b> may comprise at least one sensor <b>26</b>, a control system or processor <b>28</b>, and a transmitter <b>30</b>. The sensing platform <b>14</b> also may be provided with a receiver <b>32</b>, in which case the combination of the transmitter <b>30</b> and receiver <b>32</b> may be referred to herein in the alternative as a transceiver <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">The one or more sensors <b>26</b> comprising the sensing platform <b>14</b> may be used to sense one or more conditions of the transmission system <b>12</b> and/or one or more conditions of an environment around the transmission system <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the control system or processor <b>28</b> is operatively associated with the sensor(s) <b>26</b> and is also responsive to output signal(s) <b>36</b> produced by the sensor(s) <b>26</b> that relates to the sensed condition(s). The control system <b>28</b> produces information <b>20</b> that relates to or is derived from the sensed condition. The transmitter <b>30</b> is then used to transmit the information <b>20</b> produced by the control system <b>28</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">The sensing platform <b>14</b> may also be provided with a power conversion system <b>72</b>. Power conversion system <b>72</b> extracts energy from the transmission system <b>12</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and converts it into a form useable by the sensing platform <b>14</b>. For example, in an embodiment wherein the transmission system <b>12</b> comprises an electrical power transmission system <b>38</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the power conversion system <b>72</b> may comprise an inductive power converter <b>74</b>. Briefly, inductive power converter <b>74</b> may comprise a wire coil <b>76</b> positioned so that it is within an alternating magnetic field (shown schematically at “B” in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) surrounding an electrical conductor <b>40</b> of the electrical power transmission system <b>38</b>. The alternating magnetic field B induces an alternating electric current in wire coil <b>76</b> which may then be rectified and/or regulated by the inductive power converter <b>74</b> so that it is useable by the sensing platform <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">In a typical operational example, each sensing platform <b>14</b> monitors at least one condition of the transmission system <b>12</b>, such as, for example, vibrations detected in the transmission system <b>12</b> due to an event <b>55</b> occurring on or nearby support tower <b>42</b>. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, each sensing platform <b>14</b> may monitor at least one condition of an environment around the transmission system <b>12</b>, such as, for example, an ambient temperature or light in the infrared wavelength range that may be emitted by various objects or persons in the environment around the transmission system <b>12</b>. The control system <b>28</b> of each sensing platform <b>14</b> may be configured to evaluate or analyze the output signals <b>36</b> produced by the sensor or sensors <b>26</b> to produce information <b>20</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the control system <b>28</b> analyzes the output signal(s) <b>36</b> from the sensor(s) <b>26</b> to determine whether the sensed condition is a normal condition or an anomalous condition. If the sensed condition is determined to be an anomalous condition, the control system <b>28</b> may operate the transmitter <b>30</b> of the sensing platform <b>14</b> to transmit information <b>20</b>. The transmitted information <b>20</b> is ultimately received by the endpoint receiver <b>18</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). If the sensed condition is determined to be a normal condition, then no information need be sent, although it could be.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">In this regard it should be noted that, in a typical embodiment, the endpoint receiver <b>18</b> will be located at a position beyond the transmitting range of most of the individual sensing platforms <b>14</b>. Therefore, in order to ensure that the transmitted signal from any one of the individual sensing platforms <b>14</b> will be received by the endpoint receiver <b>18</b>, each sensing platform <b>14</b> may be provided with a transceiver <b>34</b> (e.g., a transmitter <b>30</b> and a receiver <b>32</b>). Consequently, in an embodiment wherein the monitoring system <b>10</b> comprises a plurality of sensing platforms <b>14</b> having such transceivers <b>34</b>, signals transmitted by one sensing platform <b>14</b> may be received by one or more nearby sensing platforms <b>14</b>. The nearby sensing platform(s) <b>14</b> may then re-transmit the signal, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this manner, the transmitted signal may be relayed by various ones of the sensing platforms <b>14</b> comprising the monitoring system <b>10</b> until the signal is ultimately received by the endpoint receiver <b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">Additional redundancy may be realized by providing the monitoring system <b>10</b> with two or more endpoint receivers <b>18</b> located at different positions along the transmission system <b>12</b> (not depicted). If, for some reason, the signal from a sensing platform <b>14</b> fails to be relayed by nearby sensing platforms <b>14</b> along one direction, (thus fails to reach a first endpoint receiver <b>18</b>), the signal from sensing platform <b>14</b> relayed by nearby sensing platforms <b>14</b> in the other direction may be received by a second endpoint receiver <b>18</b> located at the different position. Of course, the provision of additional endpoint receivers <b>18</b> at various points along the transmission system <b>12</b> may provide additional measures of redundancy.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">Once the information <b>20</b> is received by the endpoint receiver <b>18</b> it may be presented in human-readable form, thereby allowing a user or system operator to interpret and/or act upon the information <b>20</b>, as the case may be. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the endpoint receiver <b>18</b> is operatively associated with a user interface system <b>22</b> for this purpose. The user interface system <b>22</b> may present the received information <b>20</b> on a display system <b>78</b>. For example, if the information <b>20</b> relates to an anomalous condition (e.g., event <b>55</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) detected by one or more of the sensing platforms <b>14</b>, the user interface system <b>22</b> may provide an indication about the anomalous condition, what it may relate to (e.g., vibrations, temperature, or infrared signature), as well as the particular sensing platform(s) <b>14</b> that detected the anomalous condition. Additional information, data, and options may also be provided by user interface system <b>22</b>, as will be described in further detail herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">One advantage of the present invention is that it may be used to monitor a transmission system <b>12</b> and to provide to an endpoint receiver <b>18</b> information <b>20</b> regarding one or more monitored conditions. In one exemplary embodiment, the information <b>20</b> regarding the one or more monitored conditions may be evaluated by a user to make a determination about whether the integrity of the transmission system <b>12</b> is, or may soon be, compromised. Alternatively, in another exemplary embodiment, a user may utilize the information <b>20</b> about the monitored condition or conditions for purposes other than evaluating the integrity and security of the transmission system <b>12</b>. For example, the information <b>20</b> provided by one or more of the sensing platforms <b>14</b> may be utilized to derive information about the passage of persons or vehicles within sensing range of one or more of the individual sensing platforms <b>14</b>. Still other purposes and variations are possible, as would become apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings provided herein. Consequently, the methods, apparatus, and systems shown and described herein should not be regarded as limited to any particular purpose.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">Still other advantages are associated with the power conversion system <b>72</b> which may be provided in each of the sensing platforms <b>14</b>. For example, deriving from the transmission system <b>12</b> the energy required to operate the individual sensing platforms <b>14</b> dispenses with the need to provide each individual sensing platform <b>14</b> with a separate power supply (e.g., a storage battery) capable of operating the sensing platform <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the power conversion system <b>72</b> will allow the individual sensing platforms <b>14</b> to be readily located at even remote areas along the transmission system <b>12</b> without concern for providing a separate power source (e.g., a storage battery) to the sensing platforms <b>14</b>. Of course, the arrangement also dispenses with the need to periodically service or replace the storage battery.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">Still other advantages are associated with the monitoring system <b>10</b>. For example, and as shown and described herein, a plurality of individual sensing platforms <b>14</b> may be mounted at various locations <b>16</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) along the transmission system <b>12</b>, thereby allowing extended portions, or even substantially the entirety, of the transmission system <b>12</b> to be monitored. Alternatively, only selected portions of the transmission system <b>12</b> may be monitored with the monitoring system <b>10</b>. In addition, the ability of the sensing platforms <b>14</b> to relay transmissions from adjacent sensing platforms <b>14</b> allows low-power transmitters (e.g., transceivers) to be utilized. The signal relaying capability also dispenses with the need to provide more than one endpoint receiver <b>18</b>, although multiple endpoint receivers <b>18</b> may be provided if so desired. In addition, the signals transmitted by the individual sensing platforms <b>14</b> are typically of sufficient strength so that they may be received by more than one adjacent sensing platform <b>14</b>. Consequently, the signal may continue to be relayed even though one of the sensing platforms <b>14</b> receiving the transmitted signal may be unable to re-transmit (e.g., relay) the signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">Moreover, it should also be noted that the various individual sensing platforms <b>14</b> and monitoring system <b>10</b> are not limited to use with electrical power transmission systems <b>38</b>, but could also be used with other types of transmission systems, such as, for example, telecommunications (e.g., telephone) systems, oil pipelines, gas pipelines, water pipelines, or other types of systems for moving or transmitting resources, such as electricity or materials, from one location to another.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">Having briefly described one embodiment of the methods, apparatus, and systems for monitoring transmission systems, as well as some of their more significant features and advantages, various exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">Referring back now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a monitoring system <b>10</b> is shown and described herein as it may be used to monitor a transmission system <b>12</b>. The transmission system <b>12</b> may comprise an electrical power transmission system <b>38</b> having a plurality of electrical conductors <b>40</b> supported by a plurality of support towers <b>42</b>. Alternatively, the monitoring system <b>10</b> may be used with other types of transmission systems, such as, for example, telecommunications (e.g., telephone) systems, oil pipelines, gas pipelines, water pipelines, or other types of systems for moving or transmitting resources, such as electricity or materials, from one location to another. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to use with any particular type of transmission system <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">The monitoring system <b>10</b> may comprise at least one, and typically a plurality of sensing platforms <b>14</b> provided at various locations <b>16</b> along the transmission system <b>12</b>. For example, in the embodiment shown and described herein wherein the transmission system <b>12</b> comprises an electrical power transmission system <b>38</b>, the various sensing platforms <b>14</b> are mounted to one of the electrical conductors <b>40</b> at locations <b>16</b> nearby the support towers <b>42</b>. So positioning the various sensing platforms <b>14</b> nearby the support towers <b>42</b> will allow the sensing platforms <b>14</b> to more easily monitor conditions (e.g., event <b>55</b>) on and around the support towers <b>42</b>. Of course, other positioning arrangements may be utilized depending on the particular type of transmission system <b>12</b> and the conditions to be monitored.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">Before proceeding with the description, it should be noted that the various ones of the sensing platforms <b>14</b> comprising the monitoring system <b>10</b> may be identical to one another, although this need not be the case. For example, in an alternative embodiment, various ones of the sensing platforms <b>14</b> comprising the monitoring system <b>10</b> may be provided with different sensing capabilities depending on where they are to be located on the transmission system <b>12</b> and depending on the particular condition(s) that is/are desired to be sensed. In addition, various ones of the sensing platforms <b>14</b> may include or lack certain other components (e.g., a transmitter <b>30</b> or receiver <b>32</b>), again depending on the particular application, as well as the desired sensing and monitoring capabilities of the monitoring system <b>10</b>. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to arrangements wherein the sensing platforms <b>14</b> are identical to one another.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">Referring now primarily to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, one embodiment of a sensing platform <b>14</b> may comprise a housing <b>24</b> sized to receive the various components and subsystems of the sensing platform <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, housing <b>24</b> may comprise a two-piece or split housing <b>24</b> having a first half <b>44</b> and a second half <b>46</b>. The first and second halves <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> of split housing <b>24</b> may define one or more respective cavities (e.g., cavities <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>) therein sized to receive the various subsystems and components of the sensing platform <b>14</b>. The first and second halves <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> may be releasably secured to one another (e.g., via a plurality of fasteners <b>52</b>) to allow the first and second halves <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> to be readily separated, thereby providing easy access to the various systems and components housed therein. The two-piece arrangement of housing <b>24</b> also allows the sensing platform <b>14</b> to be readily secured to the electrical conductor <b>40</b> of the electrical power transmission system <b>38</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">In addition to housing the various components and subsystems of the sensing platform <b>14</b>, the housing <b>24</b> may also need to be provided with certain other features and attributes to allow it to function well in the intended application (e.g., with the particular type of transmission system <b>12</b> involved) and in the expected environment. For example, in an embodiment wherein the sensing platform <b>14</b> is to be mounted to an electrical conductor <b>40</b> of an electric power transmission system <b>38</b>, the housing <b>24</b> should be configured to minimize the likelihood of corona discharge at the voltages expected in the electrical power transmission system <b>38</b>. Protection against corona discharge is particularly important wherein the voltages involved are in the tens of kilovolt range or higher. One shape that will minimize corona discharge comprises a generally cylindrically-shaped main body portion <b>54</b> having a pair of generally hemispherically-shaped end portions <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>, as best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Alternatively, other shapes are possible, as would become apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings provided herein. In order to further reduce the likelihood of corona discharge, any fasteners <b>52</b> used to fasten together the two halves <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> of housing <b>24</b> should be recessed within the halves <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> so that the fasteners <b>52</b> do not protrude beyond the exterior surface <b>58</b> of housing <b>24</b>, as best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">In such an application, housing <b>24</b> should also be made from an electrically conductive material (e.g., aluminum) so that housing <b>24</b> will remain at the same electrical potential as the electrical conductor <b>40</b>. However, suitable precautions also should be taken to prevent the housing <b>24</b> from carrying electrical current that would normally be carried by electrical conductor <b>40</b>. One suitable precaution is to provide an insulator <b>60</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) between one of the end portions (e.g., end portion <b>56</b>) of housing <b>24</b> and the electrical conductor <b>40</b>, while allowing the other end portion (e.g., end portion <b>57</b>) of housing <b>24</b> to remain in electrical contact with electrical conductor <b>40</b>. Such an arrangement will allow the housing <b>24</b> to acquire the electrical potential on electrical conductor <b>40</b> while preventing current from flowing through the housing <b>24</b> that may otherwise occur due to the “skin effect” associated with electric current flow. Alternatively, other arrangements are possible for achieving these two conditions, as would become apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings provided herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">As mentioned above, the sensing platform <b>14</b> may be provided with a variety of subsystems and components in order to carry out the functional and operational aspects of the sensing platform <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the various subsystems and components are provided on a single printed wiring board <b>68</b> sized to be received within housing <b>24</b>. Printed wiring board <b>68</b> may be housed within the second or lower half <b>46</b> of housing <b>24</b>. A cover plate <b>90</b> may be used to secure the printed wiring board <b>68</b> within the second half <b>46</b> and to insulate it from electrical conductor <b>40</b>, as best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Alternatively, other arrangements are possible, as would become apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings provided herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">Sensing platform <b>14</b> may be provided one or more sensors <b>26</b> suitable for sensing any of a wide range of conditions of the transmission system <b>12</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In this regard it should be noted that, depending on the particular type of sensor, sensor <b>26</b> may be used to sense at least one condition of the transmission system <b>12</b> or may be used to sense at least one condition of an environment surrounding the transmission system <b>12</b>. Exemplary sensors that may be utilized in sensing platform <b>14</b> include, but are not limited to, motion sensors (e.g., accelerometers), acoustic sensors, temperature sensors, and optical sensors (e.g., detectors and cameras). However, because the particular type of sensor or sensors <b>26</b> that may be utilized may depend on the particular application and conditions to be sensed, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to any particular type of sensor or combinations of sensors. By way of example, in one embodiment, each sensing platform <b>14</b> is provided with three sensors <b>26</b>: A two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b>, an infrared detector <b>64</b>, and a temperature sensor <b>66</b>, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As mentioned above, the various sensors <b>26</b> may be mounted to printed wiring board <b>68</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">Two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b> detects or senses movement (e.g., acceleration) along two different axes, which may be perpendicular to one another, although this is not required. In addition, the two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b> should not be regarded as limited to detecting accelerations along two axes, but could instead comprise a single-axis accelerometer, a three-axis accelerometer, or any combination of single- or multi-axis accelerometers, as may be required to sense or detect the desired motion.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">In the embodiment shown and described herein, two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b> may be used to detect motion (e.g., vibrations) of the transmission system <b>12</b>, such as, for example, vibrations caused by event <b>55</b> occurring on or near support tower <b>42</b>, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b> may comprise any of a wide range of accelerometers now known in the art or that may be developed in the future that arc, or would be, suitable for the intended application. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to any particular type of accelerometer. However, by way of example, in one embodiment, the two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b> comprises an “accelerometer on a chip,” such as, for example product No. ADXL203, available from Analog Devices, Inc., of Norwood, Mass. The two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b> may be mounted to the printed wiring board <b>68</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">The infrared detector <b>64</b> may be used to detect light in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Consequently, the infrared detector <b>64</b> may be used to detect objects (e.g., persons, animals, or vehicles) or events that emit infrared signatures. In one embodiment, infrared detector <b>64</b> comprises a multi-element sensor having a field of view sufficient to encompass the desired area to be sensed. For example, in an embodiment wherein the monitoring system is utilized to monitor an electrical power transmission system <b>38</b>, it will generally be desirable to provide an infrared detector <b>64</b> having a field of view that is sufficiently large so that the infrared detector <b>64</b> may be used to monitor a region that includes at least one support tower <b>42</b>. Consequently, the infrared detector <b>64</b> may be used to detect the presence of objects that may pose a threat to the integrity of the support tower <b>42</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">Infrared detector <b>64</b> may comprise any of a wide variety of infrared detectors that are known in the art or that may be developed in the future. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to use with any particular type of infrared detector <b>64</b>. However, by way of example, in one embodiment, infrared detector <b>64</b> may comprise an infrared detector available from PerkinElmer Optoelectronics, Inc., of Fremont, Calif. as product no.

A suitable lens <b>70</b> may be mounted to housing <b>24</b>, as best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Alternatively, other arrangements are possible, as would become apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings provided herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Sensing platform <b>14</b> may also be provided with a temperature sensor <b>66</b> for monitoring an ambient temperature, which may be desirable in certain applications. In one embodiment, temperature sensor <b>66</b> may comprise a temperature sensor available from Microchip Technology Inc., of Chandler, Ariz. as product No. TC1047. Temperature sensor <b>66</b> may be mounted on printed wiring board <b>68</b>, although other arrangements are possible.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">The sensing platform <b>14</b> may also comprise a control system or processor <b>28</b> operatively associated with the sensor or sensors <b>26</b>. Control system <b>28</b> receives output signals <b>36</b> from each of the sensors <b>26</b> and produces information <b>20</b> relating to the one or more conditions sensed by the sensors <b>26</b>. Control system or processor <b>28</b> may also be mounted to printed wiring board <b>68</b> and may comprise one or more general-purpose digital signal processors or “computers on a chip” of the type well known in the art and readily commercially available. By way of example, in one embodiment, the control system <b>28</b> comprises two digital signal processors <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> that operate together to perform the functions and operations of control system <b>28</b>. The first digital signal processor <b>80</b> operates the various sensors <b>26</b>, receives the various output signals <b>36</b> produced by the sensors <b>26</b>, and analyzes the output signals <b>36</b> to produce information <b>20</b> about the sensed conditions. The second digital signal processor <b>82</b> receives the information <b>20</b> from the first digital signal processor <b>80</b> and operates the transceiver <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">The digital signal processors <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> may comprise any of a wide range of processors now known in the art or that may be developed in the future that are, or would be, suitable for the particular application. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to any particular type of processor, or even combinations of processors. However, by way of example, in one embodiment, both digital signal processors <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> may comprise processors, available from Microchip Technology Inc., of Chandler, Ariz., as product No. PIC30F6012.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">As mentioned above, it is generally desired, but not required, to provide each sensing platform <b>14</b> with a transceiver <b>34</b> comprising a transmitter <b>30</b> and a receiver <b>32</b>. Alternatively, a receiver <b>32</b> need not be provided, depending on the functionality that is to be provided by sensing platform <b>14</b>. The transceiver <b>34</b> may be connected to a suitable antenna <b>84</b> to allow signals (e.g., information <b>20</b>) to be transmitted by and received from the transceiver <b>34</b> as radio-frequency signals, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Transceiver <b>34</b> may comprise any of a wide range of transceivers known in the art and that would be suitable for the intended application. Consequently, transceiver <b>34</b> should not be regarded as limited to any particular type of transceiver. However, by way of example, in one embodiment, transceiver <b>34</b> comprises product No. MICRF505 transceiver available from Micrel, Inc., of San Jose, Calif.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">Before proceeding with the description, it should be noted that any of a wide variety of alternative configurations and devices may be utilized to transmit the information <b>20</b>. For example, the information <b>20</b> could be transmitted along one or more components (e.g., electrical conductors <b>40</b>) of the transmission system <b>12</b> itself. Alternatively, the information <b>20</b> need not be transmitted by radio, but could instead be transmitted by other means (e.g., by light), as would become apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings provided herein. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to the particular types of transmitters (e.g., radio-frequency transmitters) shown and described herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, each sensing platform <b>14</b> may be provided with a power conversion system <b>72</b>. Power conversion system <b>72</b> allows each sensing platform <b>14</b> to be operated by energy derived from the transmission system <b>12</b>. Power conversion system <b>72</b> thereby allows the sensing platform <b>14</b> to be operated without the need to provide a separate power source, such as a storage battery. Power conversion system <b>72</b> may comprise any of a wide range of systems suitable for deriving energy from the particular type of transmission system <b>12</b>. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to any particular type of power conversion system. However, by way of example, in one embodiment wherein the transmission system <b>12</b> comprises an electrical power transmission system <b>38</b>, power conversion system <b>72</b> comprises an inductive power converter <b>74</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Briefly, inductive power converter <b>74</b> may comprise a wire coil <b>76</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) positioned so that it is contained within an alternating magnetic field B produced by the electrical power transmission system <b>38</b>. In one embodiment, wire coil <b>76</b> may be wrapped around a portion of a two-piece or split core element <b>86</b> that is configured to surround electrical conductor <b>40</b> when the sensing platform <b>14</b> is mounted thereto, as best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. As is known, the alternating magnetic field B surrounding the electrical conductor <b>40</b> will induce an alternating current flow in wire coil <b>76</b>. Inductive power converter <b>74</b> may also be provided with suitable rectification and regulation circuitry (not shown) to convert the alternating current in wire coil <b>76</b> into a regulated, direct current suitable for use by the various components and systems comprising the sensing platform <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">Generally speaking, it will be advantageous to design inductive power converter <b>74</b> so that it will be substantially vibration-free during operation, as vibrations produced by inductive power converter <b>74</b> would be detected by any accelerometers or motion sensors provided on the sensing platform <b>14</b>. Vibration-free operation can be enhanced by ensuring that the split core element <b>86</b> remains linear (e.g., does not become magnetically saturated) during operation. Inductive power converter <b>74</b> may also be provided with one or more large capacitors or “super” capacitors (not shown) to provide electrical power to the sensing platform <b>14</b> for some period of time (e.g., minutes) if the current flow in the electrical conductor <b>40</b> is lost. Therefore, sensing platform <b>14</b> will be able to transmit information about the anomalous condition (e.g., power loss in the electrical conductor <b>40</b>). Alternatively, other back-up power supplies (e.g., storage batteries) could be utilized.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Referring back now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may comprise a receiver (not shown) suitable for receiving information <b>20</b> transmitted by one or more sensing platforms <b>14</b>. Endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may also be provided with a transmitter (also not shown) for transmitting data to the various sensing platforms <b>14</b>. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the receiver and transmitter are combined into a transceiver that may be identical to the transceiver utilized in the sensing platforms <b>14</b>, thus will not be described in further detail herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">As mentioned, endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may be configured to operate in conjunction with user interface system <b>22</b>. Consequently, endpoint receiver <b>18</b> need not be provided with a separate user interface system, although a user interface could be provided directly on endpoint receiver <b>18</b>. However, endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may be provided with a suitable data interface system (also not shown) suitable for allowing endpoint receiver <b>18</b> to communicate with user interface system <b>22</b>. In an example embodiment wherein user interface system <b>22</b> comprises a general purpose programmable computer (e.g., a personal computer), the data interface system provided on the endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may comprise any of a wide range of data interface systems or communication links <b>77</b> suitable for communicating with the particular type of computer comprising the user interface system <b>22</b>. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to any particular type of data interface system. However, by way of example, in one embodiment, the data interface system may comprise an RS-232 data interface system.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">In this regard, it should be noted that alternative variations are possible for allowing endpoint receiver <b>18</b> to communicate with user interface system <b>22</b> via communication link <b>77</b>. For example, in an alternative embodiment, communication link <b>77</b> may comprise an existing communication system (e.g., telephone lines, microwave relay stations, fiber-optic lines, etc.) located with or nearby the transmission system <b>12</b>. Thus, information may be transmitted between endpoint receiver <b>18</b> and user interface system <b>22</b> via an existing communication system. Such an arrangement may allow one or more endpoint receivers <b>18</b> to be conveniently mounted on one or more support towers <b>42</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and tied-in to the existing communication system (e.g., telephone line), thereby allowing the user interface system <b>22</b> to be provided at any convenient location.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, user interface system <b>22</b> may comprise any of a wide range of systems and devices known in the art or that may be developed in the future that are or would be suitable for allowing the desired degree of user interface with monitoring system <b>10</b>. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the user interface system <b>22</b> may comprise a general purpose programmable computer system, such as a personal computer having a display system <b>78</b> and a keyboard <b>88</b>. Information <b>20</b> received by endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may be displayed on the display system <b>78</b> of user interface system <b>22</b>. The keyboard <b>88</b> may be utilized to manipulate the information <b>20</b> and/or change the layout of the information <b>20</b> provided on display system <b>78</b>. In addition, and as will be described in greater detail below, user interface system <b>22</b> may be used to send data and/or programming information or modifications back to the sensing platforms <b>14</b> via the transceiver provided in the endpoint receiver <b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">The monitoring system <b>10</b> may be operated as follows to sense at least one condition of the transmission system <b>12</b>. As was previously described, the various sensing platforms <b>14</b> may be used to sense one or more conditions of the transmission system <b>12</b>, ranging from, for example, vibrations of the transmission system <b>12</b> sensed by the two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b>, infrared light emitted by objects or persons within the sensing area of infrared sensor detector <b>64</b>, and/or the ambient temperature, as sensed by the temperature sensor <b>66</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The output signal(s) <b>36</b> from the sensor or sensors <b>26</b> are received by the control system or processor <b>28</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). While the control system or processor <b>28</b> may simply pass-on the signals to the transmitter <b>30</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) without evaluation or analysis (whereupon they may be transmitted as information <b>20</b>), it will generally be more preferable for the control system or processor <b>28</b> to first evaluate or analyze the output signals <b>36</b> in order to determine whether the sensed conditions are normal or anomalous. In this way, only information <b>20</b> that relates to an anomalous condition need be transmitted.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">A data processing routine <b>92</b> that may be utilized by the control system <b>28</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to evaluate the output signals <b>36</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In one embodiment, the output signal <b>36</b> from the sensors <b>26</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) may be pre-filtered at step <b>94</b> in order to remove unwanted or undesirable components (e.g., 60 Hz noise and harmonics thereof) from the output signals <b>36</b> in order to simplify subsequent processing and analysis. The pre-filtering process <b>94</b> may involve the use of one or more analog or digital filters, such as high-pass, low-pass, or band-pass filters. The particular characteristics of the pre-filter <b>94</b> may vary depending on the particular types of output signals <b>36</b> produced by the various sensors <b>26</b> and would be easily selected by persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings provided herein and after considering the particular sensors <b>26</b> to be utilized and noise components to be removed. Consequently, the particular types of filters that may be utilized in the pre-filtering process will not be described in further detail herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">After suitable pre-filtering, filtered signals may then be digitized at step <b>96</b>. Of course, such digitization need not be performed if the signals already comprise digital, as opposed to analog, signals. The digitized signals may then be processed by any of a wide variety of digital signal processing techniques in order to produce signals that may be more conducive to the subsequent analysis process <b>104</b>. The particular digital signal processing techniques will depend on the type of analysis to be performed, e.g., to determine whether the output signals <b>36</b> are indicative of a normal condition or an anomalous condition, as well as on the particular nature of the output signals <b>36</b>, e.g., whether the output signals <b>36</b> were generated by an accelerometer (e.g., a two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b>), an infrared sensor (e.g., infrared detector <b>64</b>), or by a temperature sensor (e.g., temperature sensor <b>66</b>), see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For example, an output signal from a temperature sensor (e.g., temperature sensor <b>66</b>) will require much less processing than an output signal generated by an accelerometer (e.g. a two-axis accelerometer <b>62</b>) or an infrared sensor (e.g., infrared detector <b>64</b>), in order to determine whether the signal is regarded as indicative of a normal condition or an anomalous condition. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to any particular digital signal processing technique or series of signal processing techniques. However, by way of example, in one embodiment, a subsequent digital signal processing technique may comprise a Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) step <b>98</b>, in which the output signals are converted from the time domain into the frequency domain. A subsequent filtering step <b>102</b> may then be conducted to filter or remove unwanted components from the processed signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">After the output signals <b>36</b> have been digitized, processed, and filtered, as described above, they may then be analyzed at step <b>104</b>. As mentioned above, the analysis process <b>104</b> may be performed to determine whether the output signal <b>36</b> produced by the sensor <b>26</b> is indicative of a normal condition or an anomalous condition. One way to make such a determination is to compare the output signal <b>36</b> with a threshold value or values associated with a normal condition. If the output signal <b>36</b> is outside the threshold value or values, then the sensed condition is regarded as anomalous. The particular threshold value or values that may be utilized will depend on the particular sensor output signal to be analyzed, as well as on the particular type of transmission system <b>12</b> and environment. In certain circumstances, it will be sufficient to simply compare the processed output signal with the corresponding threshold value or values established for the particular sensor. However, in other cases, it may be necessary to additionally process the data before making the comparison.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">For example, and with reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a better determination as to whether data from a motion sensor (e.g., two-axis accelerometers <b>62</b>) are indicative of a normal condition or an anomalous condition may require the power spectrum of the signal to be computed, as illustrated in step <b>106</b>. The impulse energy of the power spectrum may then be computed at step <b>108</b>. The computed impulse energy may then be compared with a corresponding threshold value or values at step <b>110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Before proceeding with the description, it should be noted that the threshold value or values may be developed from testing associated with the particular type of transmission system <b>12</b>, as well as on the particular type of sensor. For example, in the case of sensing vibrations of an electrical power transmission system <b>38</b> that may be caused by a potentially threatening event <b>55</b> (e.g., an explosion, sawing, hammering, or climbing) on one or more support towers <b>42</b>, suitable threshold values may be determined by measuring accelerations detected by one or more sensing platforms <b>14</b> mounted on the electrical conductors <b>40</b> in response to simulated events. The resulting responses may then be used to establish corresponding threshold values.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">While the accelerations themselves could be analyzed (e.g., as they are detected in the time domain), it will generally be easier to perform the analysis if the acceleration data is converted into the frequency domain (e.g., via Fast-Fourier Transform of process <b>98</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The power spectrum and impulse energy can be calculated (at steps <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, respectively) by known techniques. In this way, threshold values associated with potentially threatening activities can be determined and programmed into the control system <b>28</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Then, if similar signals are detected (e.g., as determined in step <b>110</b>), then a determination can be made at step <b>112</b> as to whether the signals are indicative of a normal condition (e.g., vibrations due to wind) or an anomalous condition (e.g., sawing or hammering occurring on one or more support towers <b>42</b>). If an anomalous condition is determined, the control system <b>28</b> may then operate transmitter <b>30</b> to transmit information <b>20</b> relating to the anomalous condition (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). That is, the analysis process <b>104</b> can report the anomalous condition at step <b>114</b>. The analysis process <b>104</b> may also be configured to send a report (e.g., transmit information <b>20</b>) when the condition clears at step <b>116</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">As mentioned, the information <b>20</b> provided in the report (e.g., at step <b>114</b>) transmitted by the sensing platform <b>14</b> may comprise any of a wide range of information. For example, in addition to merely reporting the detection of an anomalous condition, information <b>20</b> may contain processed data (e.g., the calculated impulse energy), as well as unprocessed or raw data produced by the sensors <b>26</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The information <b>20</b> may also include data from other sensors <b>26</b> even if the data produced thereby was determined to be indicative of a normal condition. Of course, the information <b>20</b> may also contain the identity and/or location of the sensing platform <b>14</b> that detected the anomalous condition. In short, information <b>20</b> may comprise any of a wide variety of information that may be useful to a system operator if an anomalous condition is detected.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The information <b>20</b> transmitted by the sensing platform <b>14</b> that detected the anomalous condition may be relayed by one or more other sensing platforms <b>14</b> provided on the transmission system <b>12</b> before being received by endpoint receiver <b>18</b>, as already described. Endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may operate in conjunction with user interface system <b>22</b> in order to provide the information <b>20</b> in any desired form. For example, upon initial receipt of information <b>20</b> relating to an anomalous condition, user interface system <b>22</b> may be programmed to provide a visual and/or aural alarm. The identification and location of the particular sensing platform or platforms <b>14</b> that detected the anomalous condition may also be provided, along with processed data and/or raw data. Any other information may be provided that would be deemed useful to a system operator in evaluating the seriousness of the situation. For example, if the sensing platform <b>14</b> is provided with an optical sensor (e.g., a camera), image data from the camera may be provided to allow a user to perhaps determine the cause of the anomalous condition.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">As described earlier, the user interface system <b>22</b> and endpoint receiver <b>18</b> may also be used to transmit information to the various sensing platforms <b>14</b>. For example, in response to receiving information <b>20</b> indicative of the detection of an anomalous condition, the user may instruct the user interface system <b>22</b> to send a signal to the sensing platform <b>14</b> requesting additional data relating to the detected condition. The user interface system <b>22</b> could also be used to re-program one or more of the other sensing platforms <b>14</b> to, for example, change the threshold levels. Such re-programming could allow the anomalous condition to be determined with more certainty by determining whether other sensing platforms <b>14</b> detected similar data. Of course, such re-programming of the sensing platforms <b>14</b> need not be done upon the detection of an anomalous condition, but could be done at any time. Many other variations are possible, as would become apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings provided herein. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to the particular programming sequences and operational scenarios shown and described herein.</p>
