<heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS AND CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a Continuation-In-Part of a U.S. Non-provisional patent application Ser. No. 10/615,208, entitled, “Multiple Access Wireless Communications Architecture,” filed Jul. 7, 2003, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/428,456, entitled “Approach For Using Spatial Division To Increase Throughput In A Wireless Communication System,” filed Nov. 21, 2002, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
  <p num="p-0003">This application further claims the benefit of a U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/492,017 entitled, “Wireless Communication Architecture,” filed Aug. 1, 2003, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">This invention relates generally to wireless communications systems and, more specifically, to enhancing coverage and throughput in a wireless communications architecture.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0005">The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued, but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, the approaches described in this section may not be prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">A communications network is any system or mechanism that provides for the exchange of information or data between participants. In existing wireless communications networks, such as a wireless Local Area Networks (LANs) or Personal Area Networks (PANs), a wireless access point functions as a transceiver in communicating with a number of wireless devices. As used herein, the term “wireless device” refers to any type of device that uses a wireless communications protocol to communicate. Example wireless devices include, without limitation, desktop, laptop and handheld computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), cell phones and various other portable devices. The radiation pattern of wireless access points is usually omni directional, i.e., the wireless access point transmits information in 360 degrees, so that all wireless devices within range of the wireless access points receive all transmitted signals. Wireless access points also perform various management functions, such as selecting specific frequencies on which to transmit data to particular wireless devices in the system.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">One ongoing issue with wireless communications architectures is how to increase the number of wireless devices that can simultaneously communicate within a specified physical area given a fixed amount of allocated electromagnetic spectrum. This is particularly important when a number of wireless devices in the specified area are attempting to simultaneously communicate with a wireless access point to access a communications network, such as the Internet. For example, it is not uncommon for large numbers of users to use laptop computers to access the Internet during tradeshows and conferences. As another example, in some corporate offices, many users share wireless access points to access the Internet with laptop computers. As yet another example, many coffee shops now offer free wireless Internet access to customers. All of these situations strain the available access resources since only a limited number of available communications channels must be shared by all participants. For example, the IEEE 802.11(b) standard in the FCC regulatory domain, sometimes referred to as “WiFi”, defines 11 communications channels. Thus, assuming that each channel is dedicated to a single user, only 11 users can communicate simultaneously.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Conventional approaches for addressing this problem include employing multiple access communications protocols to increase the number of wireless devices that can simultaneously access a wireless access point. Example multiple access communications protocols include, without limitations, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). The use of multiple access communications protocols can significantly increase the number of wireless devices that can operate simultaneously on a specified set of communications channels. For example, the use of TDMA can increase the number of wireless devices that can share a specified set of communications channels compared to FDMA. Even using TDMA however, a wireless access point can communicate to only one wireless device in any one timeslot. Furthermore for any wireless device to communicate to another wireless device or to the wired network, it must transmit its data to the wireless access point. The wireless access point then transmits the data to another wireless device or to the wired infrastructure, such as the Internet. The throughput of the network is therefore necessarily limited by the throughput of communications between the wireless access point and any one wireless device at a particular point in time. Consequently, in conventional systems, the amount of data that can be transferred at any one timeslot is equal to the throughput of the link from the wireless access point to the particular wireless device to which it is communicating. All other wireless devices are in a state waiting for a free time slot to transmit or receive a quantum of data.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Cross-channel interference is another issue confronting conventional approaches. In the previously described example of the EEE 802.11(b) standard in the FCC regulatory domain, the 11 communications channels often overlap one another. Thus, assuming that two users are each using different but overlapping channels, the two users' communications could interfere with one another.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Management and growing of networks of Wireless Access Points is a complicated process. Adding another wireless access point generally requires one to adjust the power and channel assignments of access points in the vicinity of a new access point in order to avoid interference.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Based on the foregoing, there is a need for a wireless communications architecture that does not suffer from limitations in prior approaches. There is a particular need for a wireless communications architecture that allows a greater number of wireless devices to communicate substantially simultaneously with little or no interference.</p>

I. Overview
</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0029">As described in this disclosure, in one embodiment, a sectorized access point with the capability to tailors its configuration can provide the ability to reduce network disruption and to also increase network performance. A sectorized access point refers to a wireless access point that allocates channels to sectors, spatial regions proximately located to the access point. In sectorized access point installations, channel to sector assignments are determined for the installation in which wireless devices surround the wireless communications transmitter in a relatively confined region. But some sites may require wireless communications at a greater distance from the wireless communications transmitter than other sites. On the other hand, some installations may have a relatively greater number of devices in relatively closer proximity to the wireless communications transmitter. The channel to sector assignment should be determined based not just on reducing overall interference, but also on the characteristics of the wireless transmitter, the number and proximity of wireless devices with which the wireless transmitter is to communicate, regulatory Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) constraints and so forth. It is also observed that in some situations, it is advantageous to have sectors with shapes other than a “pie shaped” wedge. For example, an installation may desire to provide wireless communications in a rectangular shaped room. In such an installation, it would be desirable to extend wireless communications coverage into the corners of the rectangle, while at the same time limit the range of the signal at the sides of the rectangle to prevent interference with another office's installation. Growth and change further compound the allocation problem, because a channel allocation that works today may not work tomorrow.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The present invention provides in an embodiment channel allocation techniques for increasing one or more of throughput and coverage in a wireless communications environment. In one embodiment, a mode of operation is selected from a plurality of modes of operation, enabling a wireless communications transmitter to be dynamically configured to reach a wireless communications devices at a greater distance from the transmitter without increased interference between communications channels (“range mode”) or to provide wireless communications to a greater number of wireless communications devices within a relatively closer distance to the wireless transmitter (“capacity mode”) or to provide wireless communications using a single channel to provide wireless communications at a relatively greatest distance from the transmitter (“super range mode”). In one embodiment, the device selects channels having a high channel rejection and isolation when operating in range mode to reduce inter-channel interference. In one embodiment, the device spatially allocates a relatively greater number of channels to sectors to reduce inter-channel interference between sectors when operating in capacity mode. In one embodiment, the device select a single interference free channel when operating in super range mode to provide extended range wireless communications.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">In another aspect, in one embodiment, a transmitter coupled to an antenna configured to provide selective, substantially simultaneous communications with wireless devices located in different spatial areas (“sectors”) around the antenna dynamically allocates channels to sectors in order to create one or more logical sectors. In one embodiment, logical sectors may comprise sectors of unequal radii. In one embodiment, logical sectors may comprise sectors of different angles. In one embodiment, logical sectors may comprise sectors driven with different power settings. In one embodiment, logical sectors may comprise adjacent sectors and/or non-adjacent sectors.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">Embodiments employ multiple access communications protocol techniques to provide selective, substantially simultaneous communications with wireless devices. Embodiments can provide communications between wireless devices in a single sector, between wireless devices in different sectors and between wireless devices and a wired network or wireless backhaul network.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">In one embodiment, there is provided a method for determining an assignment of wireless communications channels to a plurality of wireless communications transmitters. An input specifying a mode of operation is received. A plurality of available wireless communications channels is determined based upon a number of wireless communications transmitters in the plurality of wireless transmitters and the mode of operation. A wireless communications channel assignment that provides the specified mode of operation is determined based upon the plurality of available wireless communications channels and the number of wireless communications transmitters in the plurality of wireless transmitters.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">In one embodiment, in which the mode of operation can provide for a greater range of coverage relative to other modes of operation, determining a wireless communications channel assignment based upon the plurality of available wireless communications channels and a number of wireless communications transmitters in the plurality of wireless transmitters includes determining a wireless communications channel assignment in which the wireless communications channels have a greatest frequency separation relative to the plurality of available wireless communications channels.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">In one embodiment, determining a wireless communications channel assignment in which the wireless communications channels have a greatest frequency separation relative to the plurality of available wireless communications channels includes assigning a plurality of wireless communications transmitters to a shared wireless communications channel. The wireless communications transmitters assigned to the shared wireless communications channel use a multiple access communications protocol to determine availability of the shared wireless channel prior to transmitting on the shared wireless communications channel. In one embodiment, the multiple access communications protocol comprises at least one of a carrier sense, carrier detect and an energy detect mechanism.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">In one embodiment, determining a wireless communications channel assignment in which the wireless communications channels have a greatest frequency separation relative to the plurality of available wireless communications channels includes determining a wireless communications channel assignment in which the wireless communications channels do not overlap.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">In one embodiment, in which the mode of operation provides greater throughput relative to other modes of operation, determining a wireless communications channel assignment based upon the plurality of available wireless communications channels and a number of wireless communications transmitters in the plurality of wireless transmitters further includes determining a wireless communications channel assignment in which the wireless communications channels have a greatest bandwidth relative to the plurality of available wireless communications channels.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">In one embodiment, determining a wireless communications channel assignment in which the wireless communications channels have a greatest bandwidth relative to the plurality of available wireless communications channels includes assigning each one of the plurality of wireless communications transmitters to an individual wireless communications channel, if available. Otherwise, a plurality of wireless communications transmitters is assigned to a shared wireless communications channel. The wireless communications transmitters assigned to the wireless communications channel use a multiple access communications protocol to determine availability of the wireless channel assigned to the wireless communications transmitter prior to transmitting on the wireless communications channel. In one embodiment, the multiple access communications protocol comprises at least one of a carrier sense, carrier detect and an energy detect mechanism.</p>

  <p num="h-0006">II. Operational Overview</p>
  <p num="p-0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a block diagram of a wireless communications apparatus <b>100</b> configured in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Apparatus <b>100</b> is configured to allow selective communications with wireless devices located in sectors identified by reference numerals <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, each sector <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> includes one or more wireless devices. For example, sector <b>102</b> includes four wireless devices identified generally by reference numeral <b>114</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">According to one embodiment of the invention, each sector <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> is a portion or section of a spatial area around apparatus <b>100</b>. Each sector <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> may be defined by a specified angle with respect to apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, sector <b>106</b> is an area defined by an angle a<b>1</b>, with respect to apparatus <b>100</b>. Sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> may be defined by the same angle, or different angles. In the present example, sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> are each defined by an angle of sixty degrees. Each sector <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> may also be defined by radius with respect to apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">Apparatus <b>100</b> is configured to allow selective communications with wireless devices in any number of sectors and the sectors do not need to be contiguous or provide complete coverage around apparatus <b>100</b>. The number, location and size of sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> may be selected based upon a wide variety of configuration criteria, depending upon the requirements of a particular implementation. Also, the size of sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> may be the same, or vary, depending upon the requirements of a particular implementation. Example configuration criteria include, without limitation, the expected numbers and locations of wireless devices and physical constraints of a particular implementation. For example, when implemented in a building to provide wireless access to a network, the number and locations of wireless devices that will require wireless access to the network may be considered. Also, the locations of walls and other physical obstacles, as well as the locations of noise sources and other wireless access apparatus may also be considered. In outdoor applications, the types and locations of natural obstacles as well as buildings and other interference sources may be considered.</p>
  <p num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B–1D</figref> depict example configurations for apparatus <b>100</b> to allow selective communications with wireless devices located in different sectors. Specifically, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a block diagram of apparatus <b>100</b> configured to allow selective communications with wireless devices located in three sectors <b>102</b>–<b>106</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a block diagram of apparatus <b>100</b> also configured to allow selective communications with wireless devices located in three sectors <b>102</b>–<b>106</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, however, sectors <b>102</b>–<b>106</b> are located on one side of apparatus <b>100</b>. This configuration may be used, for example, in situations where coverage is only desired in sectors <b>102</b>–<b>106</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. One example situation is where apparatus <b>100</b> is physically located within a building in a location where wireless devices will only be located in sectors <b>102</b>–<b>106</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> with respect to apparatus <b>100</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is a block diagram of apparatus <b>100</b> configured to allow selective communications with wireless devices located in two sectors <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, but not in sectors <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. Sectors <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are generally angular-shaped areas defined by angles a<b>1</b> and a<b>2</b>, respectively. This configuration may be used, for example, in situations where it is known that wireless devices are to be located in sectors <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, but not in sectors <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, apparatus <b>100</b> may be configured to allow selective communications in any number of sectors, of varying sizes and locations.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Wireless communications environments often change over time. Changes may be attributable to the introduction of new noise sources or to mobile wireless devices changing locations over time. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, suppose that a mobile wireless device <b>116</b> moves from sector <b>108</b> to sector <b>110</b>. As described in more detail hereinafter, apparatus <b>100</b> is configured to automatically detect that the move has occurred and to re-assign mobile wireless device <b>116</b> from sector <b>108</b> to <b>110</b> and perform any required updates of configuration data and data structures maintained by apparatus <b>100</b>. A frequency or timeslot assigned the mobile wireless device <b>116</b> may also be changed, depending upon the requirements of a particular application. In CSMA applications, this may not be required, since mobile wireless device <b>116</b> will automatically sense when it can begin communicating in sector <b>110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">According to one embodiment of the invention, the configuration of apparatus <b>100</b> may be dynamically changed over time to change one or more attributes of sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b>. This may include, for example, increasing or decreasing the number of sectors and/or changing the size or shape of existing sectors. The configuration of apparatus <b>100</b> may be changed for any reason. For example, apparatus <b>100</b> may be moved to a different physical location, where it is desirable to change the location or size of the sectors to provide better coverage. As another example, wireless devices may move to different locations over time.</p>
  <p num="p-0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> is a block diagram similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, except that a wireless device <b>116</b> has moved from sector <b>104</b> to sector <b>106</b>. Since apparatus <b>100</b> is not configured to allow wireless communications in sector <b>106</b>, wireless device <b>116</b> no longer has wireless communications supported by apparatus <b>100</b>. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, the configuration of apparatus <b>100</b> is dynamically changed to expand sector <b>104</b> to provide wireless communications for wireless device <b>116</b>. The angle of sector <b>104</b> has been changed from a<b>2</b>, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, to a<b>3</b>, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Sectors may be dynamically changed to address other conditions, for example for load balancing purposes. In this situation, the size (angle) of sectors are changed to increase or decrease the number of wireless devices in particular sectors to provide better load balancing, thereby increasing throughput. Sectors may also be sub-divided into multiple sub-sectors, to further reduce the number wireless devices in any particular sub-sector. Sectors may also be overlapped, for example using different communications channels, to reduce the number of wireless devices operating on any particular communications channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">The aforementioned reconfiguration of apparatus <b>100</b> may be performed using a variety of techniques, depending upon the requirements of a particular implementation. For example, the physical configuration of one or more antenna elements may be changed to change the size or shape of corresponding sectors. Changing the physical configuration of an antenna element may include several things, such as moving or re-orienting the antenna element, making physical adjustments to or re-sizing the antenna element, or even exchanging the antenna element with a different antenna element.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Instead of changing the physical configuration of an antenna element, the reconfiguration of apparatus <b>100</b> may be done by changing the electrical configuration of the apparatus <b>100</b> to change the associated sectors, for example using a beam forming network. The beam forming network may be configured to vary the amplitude and relative phase on each beam forming element to change the attributes of the beam, e.g., to create narrow or wide beams and to change the direction of the beams. Varactors may be used for this purpose. A point coordinator function or a distributed coordinator function may be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">Instead of changing the physical configuration of an antenna element, the reconfiguration of apparatus <b>100</b> may be done by changing the electrical configuration of the apparatus <b>100</b> to change the associated sectors, for example by allocating the same channel frequency to adjacent sectors. This may be performed by either a power dividing network at the radio frequency level or utilizing a protocol such as CSMA or other point coordination function at the software level.</p>
  <p num="h-0007">III. Wireless Communications Apparatus</p>
  <p num="p-0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram that depicts a wireless communications apparatus <b>200</b> configured in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.

  <p num="p-0064">According to one embodiment of the invention, the antenna system transmits and receives electromagnetic radiation in a particular spatial direction. The antenna system has the property that the radiation it transmits and receives other than from the desired spatial location is minimized.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">According to one embodiment of the invention, the antenna system has multiple transmit and receive antennas in any sector.

  <p num="p-0066">According to one embodiment of the invention, RF and bandpass filter network <b>204</b> is configured to perform two functions. First, RF and bandpass filter network <b>204</b> is configured to perform band separation and separate out one or more frequency bands from the RF signals provided by antenna system <b>202</b>. For example, this may involve processing the RF signal from antenna system <b>202</b> to obtain 2.4 and 5 GHz signals. Second, RF and bandpass filter network <b>204</b> is configured to perform channelization within each frequency band to improve system performance. The output of RF and bandpass filter network <b>204</b> is provided to WLAN NIC network <b>206</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">RF and bandpass filter network <b>204</b> may include a beamforming pointing network to dynamically change the angles of sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b>. This function allows the size and/or location of sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> to be dynamically changed.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">According to one embodiment of the invention, RF and bandpass filter network <b>204</b> is configured to join multiple sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b>. This includes allowing a signal to be transmitted to or received from multiple sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> simultaneously. This may be useful, for example, for increasing range in low isolation antenna systems at the expense of throughput.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">According to another embodiment of the invention, RF and bandpass filter network <b>204</b> may be omitted and protocol software may provide the appearance of joint multiple sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b>. This includes allowing a signal to be transmitted to or received from multiple sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> simultaneously.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">WLAN NIC network <b>206</b> is configured generally to change RF signals from RF and bandpass filter network <b>204</b> into digital signals in the form of data packets. According to one embodiment of the invention, WLAN NIC network <b>206</b> is configured to amplify the RF energy before performing frequency translation of the signal to base band separating the signal into its in-phase and quadrature components. The respective components of the signal are sampled and demodulated into their constituent bits as specified by an applicable standard, for example, the IEEE 802.11 standard. The WLAN NIC network <b>206</b> may also be configured to provide de-scrambling, error correction and low-level protocol functions, for example, RTS/CTS generation and acknowledgment, fragmentation and de-fragmentation, and automatic beacon monitoring. The decoded bits are grouped into packets, for example as specified by the IEEE standard, and then provided to switch fabric <b>208</b> and manager <b>210</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">Switch fabric <b>208</b> is coupled between WLAN NIC network <b>206</b> and a network <b>212</b>, such as a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN) or the Internet, and/or to a wireless backhaul system <b>214</b>. Wireless backhaul system <b>214</b> may include a WLAN backhaul NIC and a WLAN backhaul radiating element that are not depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for simplicity.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">Manager <b>210</b> is configured to perform a variety of management and control functions in apparatus <b>200</b>. The particular functions performed by manager <b>210</b> may vary, depending upon the requirements of a particular application, and the invention is not limited to manager <b>210</b> performing any particular tasks. Example management and control functions include, without limitation, managing overall system and sector configuration, managing the frequency bands, communications channels and communications protocols for each sector, managing security protocols, managing the transmit power level and receive sensitivity for each sector, detecting and alerting network administrators the presence of non-authorized or interfering access points and managing communications between wireless devices and between wireless devices and network <b>212</b> and wireless backhaul system <b>214</b>. Each of these management functions is described in more detail hereinafter.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">According to one embodiment of the invention, manager <b>210</b> is configured to control switch fabric <b>208</b> to provide for the selective exchange of data between wireless devices in any particular sector <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> and also between wireless devices in different sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b>. Manager <b>210</b> is also configured to perform switching functions to provide for the selective exchange of data between sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> and network <b>212</b> and between sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> and a wireless network connected to wireless backhaul system <b>214</b>.</p>

  <p num="p-0075">According to one embodiment of the invention, manager <b>210</b> is also configured to maintain configuration data that defines the configuration and operation of apparatus <b>100</b>. The configuration data may be stored on a volatile storage, such as a RAM, or a non-volatile storage, such as one or more disks or in a database, depending upon the requirements of a particular application. The configuration data may specify, for example, the configuration of the overall system and each sector, information about each wireless device, such as identification and device type information as well as the sector location of each wireless device. The configuration data may also specify a current set of selected communications channels, the particular communications channels to be used in each sector and by each wireless device and the particular frequency bands and communications protocols to be used in each sector and/or by each wireless device. As another example, the configuration data may specify a transmit power level and receive sensitivity for each sector. Manager <b>210</b> is also configured to update the configuration information in response to various events.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">According to one embodiment of the invention, manager <b>210</b> is configured to manage the movement of wireless devices between sectors. This may include, for example, re-assigning communications channels and time slots and updating other information relating to the wireless devices that moved. Suppose that a particular wireless device moves from sector <b>102</b> to sector <b>104</b>. In this situation, manager <b>210</b> may assign a new communications channel to the particular wireless device, for example if the current communications channel of the particular wireless device is not being used in sector <b>104</b>. Manager <b>210</b> then updates the configuration information to reflect that the particular wireless device is now located in sector <b>104</b> and that communications with the particular wireless device are now to be made using the new assigned communications channel.</p>

  <p num="h-0008">IV. Communications Channels, Protocols and Multiple Access Schemes</p>
  <p num="p-0081">Any type of communications channel allocation scheme may be used with the wireless communications architecture described herein. The allocation of communications channels to sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> may vary depending upon the requirements of a particular implementation and the invention is not limited to any particular channel allocation scheme. Manager <b>210</b> is configured to manage the communications channels used to communicate with wireless devices. This may include, for example, determining initial communications channels to be used by wireless devices which may be based on isolation, interference or any other factor affecting performance, assigning communications channels and timeslots to wireless devices and selecting communications protocols. This may also include periodically checking the performance of selected communications channels and dynamically changing the communications channels used by wireless devices. This may include selecting a set of communications channels to be used in each sector based upon communications channel performance.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">As described in more detail hereinafter, apparatus <b>100</b> may be configured to support multiple frequency bands operating simultaneously. Different frequency bands may be used in different sectors, or even in the same sector. For example, apparatus <b>100</b> may be configured with antenna elements and associated electronics to support communications on both the 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz frequency bands. Apparatus <b>100</b> may also be configured to support any type and number of communications protocols. Example protocols supported by apparatus <b>100</b> include, without limitations, the IEEE 802.11(x) wireless communications standards, such as 802.11(a), (b), (g), 802.15(x), 802.16(x) and 802.20(x) c wireless communications standards, and other future wireless communications standards.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">Apparatus <b>100</b> may also be configured to support any type and number of multiple access schemes to support communications with multiple wireless devices. For example, a Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), carrier detect or energy detect scheme may be employed to allow multiple wireless devices to communicate using a specified set of communications channels. The wireless devices then communicate on the allocated set of channels using a multiple access scheme such as FDMA or TDMA.</p>
  <p num="h-0009">V. Interference Mitigation and Power Control</p>
  <p num="p-0084">Wireless communications apparatus <b>100</b> may be configured to reduce the amount of interference between wireless devices in different sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b>. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to completely eliminate all interference between sectors because of the presence of main and side lobes. The general goal, therefore, is to reduce the amount of interference between sectors to below a specified level to provide reliable performance and an acceptable level of quality of service. For example, according to one embodiment of the invention, various techniques are employed to reduce the magnitude of side lobes generated by each sector to reduce the likelihood that transmissions from one sector will trigger a carrier or energy detection algorithm of another sector. Reducing the amount of interference between sectors may also allow the same communications channels to be re-used, i.e., used simultaneously in more than one sector. This greatly increases the number of wireless devices that can be supported by apparatus <b>100</b> given a limited amount of available frequency spectrum.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">Configuring apparatus <b>100</b> to reduce interference between wireless devices in different sectors may take many forms. For example, as described hereinafter in more detail, one or more antenna elements may be physically configured to reduce interference between wireless devices in different sectors. This may include selecting materials and physically constructing antenna elements in a manner to reduce interference between sectors. Also, the polarization of one or more antenna elements may be changed to reduce the amount of interference between wireless devices in different sectors. For example, the polarization orientation of adjacent sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b> may be varied to reduce interference between wireless devices operating in adjacent sectors <b>102</b>–<b>112</b>. For example, an antenna element that provides communications with wireless devices in sector <b>102</b> may have a first polarization orientation. An antenna element that provides communications with wireless devices in sector <b>104</b> may have a second polarization orientation, that is oriented at some angle to the first. In one embodiment, this may be ninety degrees with respect to the antenna element for sector <b>102</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">According to one embodiment of the invention, communications channels are selected to reduce interference between sectors and to provide a specified level of quality of service. For example, the IEEE 802.11(b) communications standard specifies communications on eleven communications channels, of which three (channels <b>1</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>11</b>) are non-overlapping. Thus, in one embodiment employing a three-sector configuration, manager <b>210</b> may specify that communication channels <b>1</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>11</b> are to be used for the three sectors to reduce the amount of interference and provide more favorable quality of service. In situations where a communications protocol is employed that does not include non-overlapping channels, a testing scheme may be used to identify a suitable assignment of communications channels to achieve specified interference and quality of service levels. This may include initial test to identify a set of initial communications channels to be assigned to the sectors, as well as subsequent periodic testing to provide an updated set of communications channels.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">According to one embodiment of the invention, transmit power levels and receive sensitivities are selected to improve communications and reduce interference between sectors. Transmit power levels and receive sensitivities may be selected on a per sector, per wireless device, or even per packet basis, depending upon the requirements of a particular implementation. Varying the transmit power level generally changes the size of a transmission area. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, the transmit power levels of apparatus <b>100</b> are selected to cause sector <b>102</b> to have a radius of R<b>1</b> and sector <b>104</b> to have a radius of R<b>2</b>. In this example, the wireless devices in sector <b>104</b> are located relatively closer to apparatus <b>100</b> than the wireless devices in sector <b>102</b>. Thus, less power needs to be used with the antenna element associated with sector <b>104</b>, relative to the antenna element associated with sector <b>102</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">Selectively adjusting the transmit power for each sector serviced by apparatus <b>100</b> reduces the overall power consumed by apparatus <b>100</b>, reduces the possible interference between sectors <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, and improves security. Varying the receive sensitivity for a particular sector changes the general sensitivity to the particular sector to transmissions from other sectors and other types of interference. According to one embodiment of the invention, the receive sensitivity for a sector is optimized to provide a specified quality of service for wireless devices in the sector, while reducing the likelihood of interference. The transmit power level and receive sensitivities may be adjusted together to optimize sector performance.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">Transmit power levels and receive sensitivities may be dynamically adjusted over time to compensate for changing conditions. This may include, for example, changes in the configuration of apparatus <b>100</b>, changes in the locations and numbers of wireless devices, changes in the frequency band or channels being used, changing power or quality of service requirements and changes in interference sources.</p>
  <p num="h-0010">VI. Antenna Configurations</p>
  <p num="p-0090">Various antenna configurations may be employed with the wireless communications architecture described herein, depending upon the requirements of a particular application. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a block diagram that depicts a top view of an antenna apparatus <b>400</b> used with antenna system <b>202</b>. Antenna apparatus <b>400</b> includes various antenna elements configured to provide wireless communications with wireless devices located in sectors <b>402</b>–<b>412</b>. Specifically, antenna apparatus <b>400</b> includes a center reflector portion <b>414</b>. With respect to sector <b>402</b>, antenna apparatus <b>400</b> includes a radiating assembly <b>416</b> configured to radiate electromagnetic energy into sector <b>402</b>. Antenna apparatus <b>400</b> also includes metal septums <b>418</b>, <b>420</b> that are configured to define sector <b>402</b>. Metal septums <b>418</b>, <b>420</b> may be separated from center reflector portion <b>414</b>, as indicated by apertures <b>422</b>, <b>424</b>, to reduce coupling between sector <b>402</b> and the other sectors <b>404</b>–<b>412</b>. According to one embodiment of the invention, septums <b>418</b>, <b>420</b> are positioned from center reflector portion <b>414</b> at a distance that is proportional to the transmission wavelength. Antenna apparatus <b>400</b> also includes RF chokes <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>, coupled to the ends of metal septums <b>418</b>, <b>420</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">Antenna apparatus <b>400</b> may also includes radio frequency absorptive material, such as foam or other material or photonic bandgap structures, disposed between the metal septums and the top and bottom of antenna apparatus <b>400</b> to further reduce coupling between sectors. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a side view of antenna apparatus <b>400</b> depicting the various components of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, radio frequency absorptive material <b>430</b> is disposed on top and bottom of septums <b>418</b>, <b>420</b> to reduce electromagnetic coupling between sectors <b>402</b>–<b>412</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">Although antenna apparatus <b>400</b> has been described in the context of sector <b>402</b>, antenna apparatus <b>400</b> includes similar antenna elements for the other sectors <b>404</b>–<b>412</b>. The dimensions and characteristics of the other antenna elements that provide wireless communications for sectors <b>404</b>–<b>412</b> may be the same as or different from the aforementioned antenna elements that provide wireless communications for sector <b>402</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a block diagram of an end view of a radiating assembly <b>500</b> configured in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Radiating assembly <b>500</b> may be used for radiating assembly <b>416</b> in antenna apparatus <b>400</b>. Radiating assembly <b>500</b> includes a base <b>502</b> and patch elements <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> attached thereto. Patch elements <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> may be built upon a PCB such as FR<b>4</b>, or other dielectric substrate. Although radiating assembly <b>500</b> is configured with two patch elements <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, radiating assembly <b>500</b> may be configured with a single patch element, depending upon the requirements of a particular implementation. Patch elements <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> are oriented with respect to each other at an angle B, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, to introduce polarization diversity. According to one embodiment of the invention, patch elements <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> are oriented at approximately ninety degrees with respect to each other, although other angles may be used, depending upon the requirements of a particular application. Radiating assembly <b>500</b> may also be oriented with respect to other radiating assemblies in an antenna apparatus to decrease polarization alignment and provide greater isolation between sectors. For example, radiating assembly <b>416</b> for sector <b>402</b> may be oriented with respect to the radiating assemblies for sectors <b>404</b>–<b>412</b> to decrease polarization alignment and provide greater isolation between sectors <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>–<b>412</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0094"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a block diagram that depicts patch element <b>504</b> configured according to one embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, patch element <b>504</b> is duel frequency and includes a radiating element <b>508</b>. Radiating element <b>508</b> is generally “T” shaped and includes a long microstrip <b>510</b> for low frequency operation and a short microstrip <b>512</b> for high frequency operation. Two microstrips <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> are not required by the invention, and some implementations may have only a single microstrip where communications in only single frequency band are required. As an alternative to using the “T” shaped radiating element <b>508</b> in dual-band applications, two separate patch elements may be used, where one of the patch elements is a small patch element that includes a low frequency microstrip and the other larger patch element includes a high frequency microstrip. In this situation, the smaller high frequency patch element may be suspended above the larger lower frequency patch element.</p>
  <p num="h-0011">VII. Logical Sectoring</p>
  <p num="p-0095"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an area being spatially segmented in an embodiment of the present invention. Embodiments employing segmentation can increase the aggregate throughput of a network.

Although area <b>601</b> is segmented into approximately equal areas in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, equal area sectors are not required. In one embodiment, a radius and an angle formed by the intersection of sector boundaries of each sector may be varied to balance the number of users in each sector. In one embodiment, the invention provides the capability to select a frequency and a polarization for each unique sector in area <b>601</b>. In an embodiment, device <b>614</b> in sector <b>602</b> and device <b>616</b> in sector <b>604</b> are able to transmit or receive substantially concurrently on the same frequency or on different frequencies.</p>
  <p num="p-0096"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram illustrating modes of operation of an example wireless communications apparatus in an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, apparatus <b>700</b> can be configured to operate in a range mode configuration <b>701</b>(<i>a</i>) and a capacity mode configuration <b>701</b>(<i>b</i>). In range mode configuration <b>701</b>(<i>a</i>), device <b>700</b> uses three channels having the highest isolation to provide wireless connectivity to devices in six physical sectors, <b>702</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>704</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>706</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>708</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>710</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>712</b>(<i>a</i>). While illustrated generally using three channels in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, device <b>700</b> is not limited to three channels and a larger or smaller number of channels may be utilized in other embodiments. In range mode (e.g., configuration <b>701</b>(<i>a</i>)), a specified maximal amount of power allowed by the applicable wireless communications standard is used for each wireless transmitter. Accordingly, a frequency allocation providing high channel rejection and isolation between channels is selected to enable device <b>700</b> to be operated at this power setting. For example, in configuration <b>701</b>(<i>a</i>), device <b>700</b> has allocated non-overlapping channels <b>11</b>, <b>1</b> and <b>6</b> as follows: channel <b>11</b> to sector <b>702</b>(<i>a</i>) and sector <b>704</b>(<i>a</i>), channel <b>1</b> to sector <b>706</b>(<i>a</i>) and sector <b>708</b>(<i>a</i>), channel <b>6</b> to sector <b>710</b>(<i>a</i>) and sector <b>712</b>(<i>a</i>). Other channel allocations may be used in various embodiments. In one embodiment, since channels on the same frequency use a carrier sense, carrier detect or energy detect algorithm for determining channel access, channels on the same frequency are able to share bandwidth even though the channels are used in adjacent sectors. For example, sector <b>702</b>(<i>a</i>) and sector <b>704</b>(<i>a</i>) are able to share channel <b>11</b> even though these sectors are adjacent because devices using this channel will use a carrier sense, carrier detect or energy detect algorithm for determining channel availability prior to accessing the channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">In capacity mode configuration <b>701</b>(<i>b</i>), device <b>700</b> uses a relatively greater number of channels to provide wireless connectivity with increased available bandwidth. In one embodiment, in capacity mode, each sector is operated using a different channel, if available. As depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each sector in capacity mode configuration <b>701</b>(<i>b</i>) is allocated a unique frequency/channel. For example, in configuration <b>701</b>(<i>b</i>), device <b>700</b> has allocated channel <b>5</b> to sector <b>702</b>(<i>b</i>), channel <b>11</b> to sector <b>704</b>(<i>b</i>), channel <b>1</b> to sector <b>706</b>(<i>b</i>), channel <b>7</b> to sector <b>708</b>(<i>b</i>), channel <b>3</b> to sector <b>710</b>(<i>b</i>) and channel <b>9</b> to sector <b>712</b>(<i>b</i>). Other channel allocations may be used in various embodiments. The device <b>700</b> allocates channels to sectors to reduce the interference between sectors.</p>
  <p num="p-0098"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example device operating in a range mode in an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a wireless communications transmitter device <b>800</b> operating in a range mode uses three channels to provide wireless connectivity to devices located in three logical sectors, including a first logical sector comprised of physical sectors <b>802</b> and <b>804</b>, a second logical sector comprised of physical sectors <b>806</b> and <b>808</b> and a third logical sector comprised of physical sectors <b>810</b> and <b>812</b>. Device <b>800</b> selects three channels with the highest isolation among one other for use in the three virtual sectors. While this embodiment is discussed generally with reference to the illustrated example using three channels, a larger or smaller number of channels can be used in other embodiments.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">In the example illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the physical sectors operating on the same channel to comprise a logical sector are not required to have the same radius. For example, physical sectors <b>802</b> and <b>804</b>, which comprise the first logical sector, are of a different radius. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the size and radius of any particular sector may be tailored to fit a particular geographic area or any room for indoor applications. In one embodiment, the radius is governed by the transmit power of the sector and the receive sensitivity set to that sector. The capability to alter radius of a sector enables device <b>800</b> to provide wireless communications coverage to devices in areas of varying shapes and sizes, such as indicated by room outline <b>813</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">In the example illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, logical sectors comprise a number of physical sectors operating on the same channel are adjacent to each other. For example, sector <b>802</b> and sector <b>804</b> share the same frequency and are adjacent to one another. Adjacency is not required to form a logical sector, however, by embodiments that provide logical sectors comprised of non-adjacent physical sectors. The device <b>800</b> automatically determines which channels are to be allocated to which sectors to reduce the interference between sectors, avoid rogue access points and to increase network throughput. As used herein, the term “Rogue access points” is used to refer to access points that are not installed or authorized by the system administrator. Such access points are non-authorized access points installed by the users or someone else. The channel allocation, power and radius may be software controlled and changed dynamically based on network conditions. By selecting channels having a high channel rejection and isolation between channels, the device <b>800</b> can be operated in range mode. Range mode enables device <b>800</b> to provide wireless communications access to devices at a greater distance from device <b>800</b>. Furthermore, device <b>800</b> employs a carrier sense, carrier detect or energy detect algorithm for determining channel access on sectors operating on the same frequency.</p>
  <p num="p-0101"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example device operating in range mode in an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, device <b>900</b> is configured to provide wireless communications to three logical sectors using three channels, in which the logical sectors are configured to be of unequal angles. For example, in one configuration illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, device <b>900</b> has configured a first logical sector comprised of physical sectors <b>902</b>, <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> and <b>908</b>, a second logical sector comprised of physical sector <b>910</b> and a third logical sector comprised of physical sector <b>912</b>. In one embodiment, a system administrator can manually change the angle, and therefore the width, of the sectors based on the number of users in a particular sector. In one embodiment, the device <b>900</b> can automatically change the width of the sectors based on the number of users in a particular sector. In one embodiment, if a sector has more than a specified number of users in a particular sector, the device <b>900</b> changes the size of the sector to balance the number of users in the sectors. Accordingly, device <b>900</b> determines the size of the sectors. The device <b>900</b> automatically determines which channels are to be allocated to which sectors to reduce the interference between sectors, avoid rogue access points and to increase network throughput. In one embodiment, channel allocation, power and radius may be changed dynamically under software control based on network conditions.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">In the example configuration depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, three channels having the highest isolation with respect to one another are allocated to the three logical sectors, however, a larger or smaller number of channels can be configured in the illustrated and other embodiments. By selecting channels having a high channel rejection and isolation between channels, the device <b>900</b> can be operated in range mode. Range mode enables device <b>900</b> to provide wireless communications access to devices at a greater distance from device <b>900</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0103"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> further illustrates that in an embodiment, sectors operating on the same channel are not required to have the same radius. The radius is governed by the transmit power of the sector and the receive sensitivity set to that sector.

  <p num="p-0105"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example device operating a wireless backhaul with another device in an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, device <b>1100</b>(<i>a</i>) has the capability to use a sector to form a wireless backhaul using a high throughput radio link established between the sector and a sector of a second device <b>1001</b>(<i>b</i>). In one embodiment, the device <b>1001</b>(<i>a</i>) establishes the wireless backhaul by sequentially searches each sector until it finds a sector <b>1010</b>(<i>a</i>) capable of communicating with another sector <b>1004</b>(<i>b</i>) from another device <b>1100</b>(<i>b</i>) suitable for forming a high-speed wireless connection.</p>

  <p num="p-0107"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A–11F</figref> are operational flow diagrams illustrating the operation of one embodiment of the present invention. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, in block <b>1101</b>, input specifying a mode of operation is received. In block <b>1102</b>, available wireless communications channels are determined based upon the number of transmitters and the mode of operation.

  <p num="p-0108">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, processing for determining whether available wireless channel(s) are to be allocated to a wireless backhaul is illustrated with reference to one example embodiment. In block <b>1112</b>, a test is performed to determine whether a wireless backhaul is present. If a wireless backhaul is present, then in block <b>1114</b>, a channel selection for providing backhaul network performance is determined.

  <p num="p-0109">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> processing for determining available wireless channels and assigning the wireless communications channels based upon the number of transmitters and the mode of operation is illustrated with reference to one example embodiment. In block <b>1116</b>, the specified mode of operation is tested to determine if a mode indicating a mode indicating greater throughput (“capacity mode”), a greater range of coverage (“range mode”) or a greatest achievable range (“super range mode”) has been selected. If the mode indicates capacity mode, then in block <b>1120</b>, a wireless communications channel assignment in which the selected wireless communications channels have a greatest bandwidth relative to available wireless communications channels is determined. If the mode indicates range mode, then in block <b>1150</b>, a wireless communications channel assignment in which wireless communications channels have greatest frequency separation relative to the available wireless communications channels is determined. If the mode indicates super range mode, then in block <b>1180</b>, a wireless communications channel assignment in which a single wireless communications channel having a minimal interference relative to the available wireless communications channels is determined.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, processing for determining wireless communications channel assignment in a capacity mode, i.e., a mode in which the selected wireless communications channels have a greatest bandwidth relative to available wireless communications channels, is illustrated with reference to one example embodiment. In block <b>1121</b>, a wireless communications device listens in each sector in order to determine external interference present in the sector. In block <b>1122</b>, a list of non-allowable channels for each sector is produced. In block <b>1123</b>, a test is made to determine whether there are more available non-overlapping wireless communications channels than sectors. If there are more available non-overlapping wireless communications channels than sectors, then in block <b>1124</b>, a channel set length, M (i.e., number of channels intended to be used), is set equal to the number of sectors. In block <b>1125</b>, all channel sets, S, of length M are determined. In block <b>1126</b>, performance of each channel set in S is determined. Performance in one embodiment may be a predicted network throughput. In 802.11, for example, every access point or other interferer on a channel is divided into the throughput to determine a predicted network throughput. Thus, the predicted network throughput for the access point is the throughput divided by the number of interferers on the channels used by the access point. For example, if the total throughput is 11 Mbps and 10 interferers are present, then the predicted performance is stated as: 11/10 provided that all stations are connected to the access point at a data rate of 11 Mbps. The rate decreases according to the maximum throughput divided by the sum of max_rate divided by the connected rate multiplied by the number of users connected at that rate, as indicated by the following formula:</p>

  <p num="p-0112">In block <b>1127</b>, the channel sets S are ordered based upon performance. In block <b>1128</b>, a test is made to determine whether there exists a channel set in S that meets network performance criteria. If a channel set in S meets the network performance criteria, then processing completes. Otherwise, there are insufficient allowable non-overlapping channels to meet the number of sectors; so overlapping channels need to be used. In one embodiment, possible sets of overlapping channels will be tested using a performance criteria until either one that meets the network performance criteria is found, or alternatively, a “best available” channel set is determined. Accordingly, processing continues with block <b>1129</b>, in which the channel set length, M, is set equal to the number of sectors. In block <b>1130</b>, all channel sets, S, of length M are determined. In block <b>1131</b>, a test is made to determine whether there exists a channel set in S that meets network performance criteria. If a channel set in S meets the network performance criteria, then processing completes. Otherwise, processing continues with block <b>1132</b>, in which the best-performing channel set is stored if its performance is better than a previously stored best-performing channel set. In block <b>1134</b>, a test is made to determine whether M is greater than one. If M is not greater than one, then in block <b>1135</b>, the best-performing channel set so far is returned as a result, and processing completes. Otherwise, processing continues with block <b>1136</b>, in which M is decremented and control is passed back to block <b>1130</b> to again determine all channel sets S having a length equal to the new value of M. The foregoing process successively tests smaller sets of independent channels to find a channel set that either meets the network performance criteria or alternatively a “best available” network capacity in one embodiment. While a greater number of non-overlapping channels typically provides a higher capacity, in certain applications the presence of more channels may not provide the greatest relative capacity because greater interference may be present between the channels. Thus, there may be a channel fit in which the same channel is used on multiple sectors, which provides an overall increased network throughput. Embodiments can employ the foregoing processing to determine alternative channel selections that employ shared or overlapping channels, which provide greater capacity in the presence of interference. Channels used more than once may be spaced farther apart in different sectors or allocated to lower priority sectors, for example, to reduce interference.</p>

In block <b>1151</b>, a wireless communications device listens in each sector in order to determine external interference or occupied channels present in the sector. In block <b>1152</b>, a list L<b>1</b> of non-desirable channel assignments for each sector is produced.

In block <b>1153</b>, a test is made to determine whether there are more available non-overlapping wireless communications channels than sectors that meet specific power constraints. In one embodiment, the power constraints are regulatory. In one embodiment, power regulatory constraint is specified as an Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP). If there are more available non-overlapping wireless communications channels than sectors that meet the EIRP constraints, then in block <b>1154</b>, a channel set length, M, is set equal to the number of sectors. In block <b>1155</b>, all channel sets, S, of length M are determined. In block <b>1156</b>, performance of each channel set in S is determined. In block <b>1157</b>, the channel sets in S are ordered based upon performance. In block <b>1158</b>, a test is made to determine whether there exists a channel set in S that meets network performance criteria. If a channel set in S meets the network performance criteria, then processing completes. Otherwise, there are insufficient non-overlapping channels. So a channel set providing reduced interference and increased range is searched. Accordingly, processing continues with block <b>1159</b>, in which the channel set length, M, is set equal to the number of non-overlapping channels that meet the EIRP constraint. In block <b>1160</b>, a list L<b>2</b> of all channel sets, S, of length M non-overlapping channels that meet the EIRP constraint is determined. In block <b>1161</b>, a list L<b>3</b> of all mappings of channels to sectors is determined. List L<b>3</b> may be formed by determining the channels in L<b>2</b> that do not interfere with channels in list L<b>1</b>. In list L<b>3</b>, a channel may be used in more than one sector. In block <b>1162</b>, the list L<b>3</b> is ordered based upon the number of sources of interference present in the sector or collisions with other applications present in list L<b>1</b>. In block <b>1163</b>, performance of each mapping in list L<b>3</b> is determined. In block <b>1164</b>, the mappings in list L<b>3</b> are ordered based upon performance. In one embodiment, the ordering is according to the performance score of the mappings of list L<b>3</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">In block <b>1165</b>, a test is made to determine whether there exists a mapping in list L<b>3</b> that meets network performance criteria. If a mapping in list L<b>3</b> meets the network performance criteria, then processing completes. Otherwise, a smaller number of channels are tried. Accordingly, processing continues with block <b>1166</b>, in which the best-performing channel set and channel to sector mapping is stored if its performance is better than a previously stored best-performing channel set and channel to sector mapping. In block <b>1167</b>, a test is made to determine whether M is greater than one. If M is not greater than one, then in block <b>1168</b>, the best-performing channel set and channel to sector mapping so far is returned as a result, and processing completes. Otherwise, processing continues with block <b>1169</b>, in which M is decremented and control is passed back to block <b>1160</b> to again determine all non-overlapping channel sets S having a length equal to the new value of M that meet the power constraint. The foregoing channel selection process successively tests smaller sets of independent channels to find a channel set that either meets the network performance criteria or alternatively a “best available” network capacity in one embodiment. In embodiments employing range mode, a switch-beamed system is provided, in which different sectors may use the same frequency but only one sector is operating at a time. Antenna gain enables communications at a greater distance and with greater selectivity, so that a wireless communications device that is enabled to listen in any one sector at a time will not experience diminished performance by an interferer if an interferer is present in a sector other than the one being communicated with because of the selectivity of the antenna radiation pattern.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref>, processing for determining a wireless communications channel assignment in a super range mode, i.e., a mode in which a single wireless communications channel is selected to operate on all sectors in order to provide greater range, is illustrated with reference to one example embodiment. In block <b>1181</b>, a wireless communications device listens in each sector with all other sectors silent. In block <b>1182</b>, a list of sources of external interference present in each sector is determined. In block <b>1183</b>, a list L<b>1</b> of non-allowable channels in each sector is produced. In block <b>1184</b>, a list L<b>2</b> of all possible channels, i.e., channels that meet power constraints that are not present in list L<b>1</b> is produced. In block <b>1185</b>, a test is made to determine whether there are channels in list L<b>2</b> that are not present in list L<b>1</b>. If there are channels in list L<b>2</b> that are not present in list L<b>1</b>, then in block <b>1186</b>, the performance of each of the channels in list L<b>2</b> that are not present in list L<b>1</b> is determined. In block <b>1187</b>, the channels in list L<b>2</b> that are not present in list L<b>1</b> are ordered based upon performance. In block <b>1188</b>, the channel ranking best is selected and processing is complete.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">Otherwise, the test of block <b>1185</b> has determined that there are no channels in list L<b>2</b> that are not present in list L<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the best available channel is selected from the channels in list L<b>1</b>, which are subject to one or more interferers. This processing continues with block <b>1189</b>, in which a penalty is charged against each channel in list L<b>1</b> for each time the channel causes an interference to occur in each other sector. In block <b>1190</b>, the channels in list L<b>1</b> are sorted based upon the penalty score. In block <b>1191</b>, performance is determined for each channel in list L<b>1</b>. In block <b>1192</b>, the channel having the best performance is selected as a result and processing is complete. For example, a channel may be selected from among channels on list L<b>1</b> based upon, criteria such as whether the interference caused by the selected channel impacts a substantially large number of wireless communications.</p>
  <p num="h-0012">VIII. Implementation Mechanisms, Alternatives &amp; Extensions</p>
  <p num="p-0117">The wireless communications architecture described herein may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination of hardware and software. For example, manager <b>210</b> may be implemented using a generic computing platform that executes various software programs to perform the functions described herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0118"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a block diagram that illustrates an example computer system <b>1200</b> upon which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Computer system <b>1200</b> includes a bus <b>1202</b> or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor <b>1204</b> coupled with bus <b>1202</b> for processing information. Computer system <b>1200</b> also includes a main memory <b>1206</b>, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus <b>1202</b> for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor <b>1204</b>. Main memory <b>1206</b> also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor <b>1204</b>. Computer system <b>1200</b> further includes a read only memory (ROM) <b>1208</b> or other static storage device coupled to bus <b>1202</b> for storing static information and instructions for processor <b>1204</b>. A storage device <b>1210</b>, such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus <b>1202</b> for storing information and instructions.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">Computer system <b>1200</b> may be coupled via bus <b>1202</b> to a display <b>1212</b>, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device <b>1214</b>, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus <b>1202</b> for communicating information and command selections to processor <b>1204</b>. Another type of user input device is cursor control <b>1216</b>, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor <b>1204</b> and for controlling cursor movement on display <b>1212</b>. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">The invention is related to the use of computer system <b>1200</b> in a wireless communications architecture. According to one embodiment of the invention, wireless communications are provided by computer system <b>1200</b> in response to processor <b>1204</b> executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory <b>1206</b>. Such instructions may be read into main memory <b>1206</b> from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device <b>1210</b>. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <b>1206</b> causes processor <b>1204</b> to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <b>1206</b>. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">The term “computer-readable medium” as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor <b>1204</b> for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device <b>1210</b>. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory <b>1206</b>. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus <b>1202</b>. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor <b>1204</b> for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system <b>1200</b> can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector coupled to bus <b>1202</b> can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and place the data on bus <b>1202</b>. Bus <b>1202</b> carries the data to main memory <b>1206</b>, from which processor <b>1204</b> retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory <b>1206</b> may optionally be stored on storage device <b>1210</b> either before or after execution by processor <b>1204</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">Computer system <b>1200</b> also includes a communication interface <b>1218</b> coupled to bus <b>1202</b>. Communication interface <b>1218</b> provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link <b>1220</b> that is connected to a local network <b>1222</b>. For example, communication interface <b>1218</b> may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface <b>1218</b> may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface <b>1218</b> sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.</p>
  <p num="p-0125">Network link <b>1220</b> typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link <b>1220</b> may provide a connection through local network <b>1222</b> to a host computer <b>1224</b> or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) <b>1226</b>. ISP <b>1226</b> in turn provides data communication services through the worldwide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the “Internet” <b>1228</b>. Local network <b>1222</b> and Internet <b>1228</b> both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link <b>1220</b> and through communication interface <b>1218</b>, which carry the digital data to and from computer system <b>1200</b>, are example forms of carrier waves transporting the information.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">Computer system <b>1200</b> can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link <b>1220</b> and communication interface <b>1218</b>. In the Internet example, a server <b>1230</b> might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet <b>1228</b>, ISP <b>1226</b>, local network <b>1222</b> and communication interface <b>1218</b>. In accordance with the invention, one such downloaded application manages a wireless communications architecture as described herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">Processor <b>1204</b> may execute the code as it is received, and/or stored in storage device <b>1210</b>, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, computer system <b>1200</b> may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.</p>
  <p num="p-0128">In the foregoing specification, embodiments of the invention have been described with reference to numerous specific details that may vary from implementation to implementation. Thus, the sole and exclusive indicator of what is, and is intended by the applicants to be, the invention is the set of claims that issue from this application, in the specific form in which such claims issue, including any subsequent correction. Hence, no limitation, element, property, feature, advantage or attribute that is not expressly recited in a claim should limit the scope of such claim in any way. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.</p>
