    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a national phase filing under 35 U.S.C. 371(c) of and claims priority to, PCT Pat. Appl. No. 2011/061384 filed Nov. 18, 2011, entitled “WIRELESS POWER UTILIZATION IN A LOCAL COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT” which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/416,701, filed Nov. 23, 2010 and entitled “WIRELESS POWER UTILIZATION IN A LOCAL COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0003">The described embodiments relate generally to wireless charging, and more specifically to devices, systems, and methods related to allocating power to receiver devices that may be located in wireless power systems.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0004">Energy or power may be transferred wirelessly using a variety of known radiative, or far-field, and non-radiative, or near-field, techniques. For example, radiative wireless information transfer using low-directionality antennas, such as those used in radio and cellular communications systems and home computer networks, may be considered wireless energy transfer. However, this type of radiative transfer is very inefficient because only a tiny portion of the supplied or radiated power, namely, that portion in the direction of, and overlapping with, the receiver is picked up. The vast majority of the power is radiated away in all the other directions and lost in free space. Such inefficient power transfer may be acceptable for data transmission, but is not practical for transferring useful amounts of electrical energy for the purpose of doing work, such as for charging electrical devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">One way to improve the transfer efficiency of some radiative energy transfer schemes is to use directional antennas to confine and preferentially direct the radiated energy towards a receiver. However, these directed radiation schemes may require an uninterruptible line-of-sight and potentially complicated tracking and steering mechanisms in the case of mobile transmitters and/or receivers. In addition, such schemes may pose hazards to objects or people that cross or intersect the beam when modest to high amounts of power are being transmitted. A known non-radiative, or near-field, wireless energy transfer scheme, often referred to as either induction or traditional induction, does not (intentionally) radiate power, but uses an oscillating current passing through a primary coil, to generate an oscillating magnetic near-field that induces currents in a near-by receiving or secondary coil. Traditional induction schemes have demonstrated the transmission of modest to large amounts of power, however only over very short distances, and with very small offset tolerances between the primary power supply unit and the secondary receiver unit. Electric transformers and proximity chargers are examples of devices that utilize this known short range, near-field energy transfer scheme.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">What is desired are methods, systems, and apparatus for efficient and user friendly interaction between peripheral devices in a wirelessly powered local computing environment.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p num="p-0007">This paper describes various embodiments that relate to a system, method, and apparatus for wirelessly providing power from a wireless power supply to any of a plurality of peripheral devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">A near field magnetic resonance (NFMR) power supply arranged to use a resonance channel to transfer energy to resonance circuits within a near field distance D, the distance D defining an outermost range of the NFMR power supply is described. The NFMR power supply includes at least a high frequency (HF) power source for providing a high frequency, orthogonal in-band power, a base plate that provides high frequency (HF) power coupled to the HF power source, and at least two “D” shaped resonators arranged to receive HF power from the base plate. The at least two “D” shaped resonators are driven 180° out of phase with each other such that the magnetic fields produced by the at least two “D” shaped resonators provide a symmetric magnetic field at a resonant frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In one aspect of the described embodiments, the symmetric magnetic field is circularly polarized. The circularly polarized magnetic field being spatially symmetric about at least two axes provides a symmetric power reception at a peripheral device independent of the spatial relationship between the peripheral device and the NFMR power supply.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In yet another aspect, the resonant frequency of the NFMR power supply is dynamically tunable to any frequency by at least changing a shape of at least one resonator of the NFRM using, for example, a piezoelectric shaping technique.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">In another embodiment, a method of determining a resonant frequency of a wirelessly powered local computing environment is disclosed. In the described embodiment, the wirelessly powered local computing environment includes at least a dynamically tunable near field magnetic resonance (NFMR) power supply arranged to wirelessly provide power to at least one receiving unit located within an effective range D of the NFMR power supply by way of a resonance channel, and a communication mechanism for providing a communication channel separate from the resonance channel between the NFMR power supply and the at least one receiving unit.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">The method can be carried out by performing at least the following operations: providing a magnetic field at a first frequency by the NFMR power supply, receiving over the communication channel an indication of an amount of wireless power received at the receiving unit over the resonance channel from the NFMR power supply, updating the first frequency of the NFMR power supply to a second frequency by dynamically tuning the NFMR power supply if the received indication is less than a maximum power, otherwise setting the resonant frequency as the first frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In yet another embodiment, a wirelessly powered local computing environment is disclosed. The wirelessly powered local computing environment includes at least a near field magnetic resonance (NFMR) power supply comprising a first symmetric magnetic resonator structure and at least one peripheral device. The peripheral device, in turn, includes a second symmetric magnetic resonance structure having a shape in accordance with the first symmetric resonator structure. The NFMR power supply uses the first symmetric magnetic resonance structure to create a symmetric magnetic field and a resonance channel coupling the NFMR power supply and the at least one peripheral device used to transfer useable energy from the first symmetric magnetic resonator structure and the second magnetic resonator structure. The wirelessly powered local computing environment also includes at least a central processing unit in communication with the NFMR power supply, the central processing unit providing processing resources to the NFMR power supply.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0025">Exemplary applications of apparatuses and methods according to the present invention are described in this section. These examples are being provided solely to add context and aid in the understanding of the invention. It will thus be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps have not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Other applications are possible, such that the following examples should not be taken as limiting.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">The following relates to techniques and apparatus for providing useful amounts of power wirelessly to devices within a wireless charging environment. In one embodiment, the wireless charging environment can include various computing devices along the lines of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, net book computer, tablet computer, etc. In some cases, a wireless power supply can be used to provide power wirelessly to various electronic devices such as a smart phone (such as an iPhone™ manufactured by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.) that include a portable power supply for mobile operation. The power provided by the wireless power supply can be used for operation of the electronic device, charging of a portable power supply within the electronic device, or any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">In the described embodiments, efficient wireless non-radiative energy transfer can be accomplished using long-lived oscillatory resonant electromagnetic modes, with localized slowly-evanescent field patterns using the well known principle of resonant coupling (i.e., two same-frequency resonant objects tend to couple, while interacting weakly with other off-resonant environmental objects). More specifically, and, in particular, the resonant coupling is resonant evanescent coupling where the coupling mechanism is mediated through the overlap of the non-radiative near-fields of the two objects. Although it has been well known that energy can be wirelessly efficiently transmitted between coupled objects in the extremely near field (e.g. in optical waveguide or cavity couplers and in resonant inductive electric transformers), in the presently described embodiments, energy is efficiently transferred over mid-range distances that are a few times larger that the largest dimension of both objects involved in the energy transfer (referred to hereinafter as effective distance d). In particular, by establishing a strong coupling, little energy is dissipated to other off-resonant objects. In the described embodiments, a strong coupling between objects can be defined in accordance with Eq. (1):
<br>κ/√{square root over (Γ<sub>1</sub>Γ<sub>2</sub>)}&gt;&gt;1  Eq. (1)<br>
where
</p>
    <p num="p-0028">Γ<sub>1,2 </sub>are the resonance widths due to the objects' intrinsic (absorption, radiation, etc.) losses, and</p>
    <p num="p-0029">κ is the coupling coefficient.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">Consequently, efficient energy transfer requires resonant modes of high Q=ω/2Γ for low (i.e., slow) intrinsic-loss rates Γ that characterize evanescent (non-lossy) stationary near-field. Furthermore, strong (fast) coupling rate κ is required over distances larger than the characteristic sizes of the objects, and therefore, since the extent of the near-field into the air surrounding a finite-sized resonant object is set typically by the wavelength, the mid-range non-radiative coupling can be achieved using resonant objects of sub-wavelength size, and thus significantly longer evanescent field-tails. Accordingly, the omni-directional but stationary (non-lossy) nature of the near field makes this mechanism suitable for mobile wireless receivers such as electronic devices (either portable or stationary), computing systems, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">Accordingly, efficient wireless power transfer can be well suited for portable applications. As a portability requirement, most portable electronic devices operate on power supplied by a coupled battery supply. The amount of power drawn by the electronic circuits in these devices determines battery life. This imposes an immediate limitation on the usage of these devices, that of recharging the batteries often to keep the devices in operational conditions. For the operational continuity of these devices, users often carry additional batteries. The battery recharging operation is typically dependent on the availability of the electric supply, and to the availability of compatible power sockets. However, in order to obviate these dependencies and inconveniences a wireless power transfer system is provided that at least in part can be used to wirelessly charge batteries. For example, the described wireless power transfer system can provide a power transmitting unit that employs magnetic resonant apparatus and/or other near field power delivery techniques, such as non-radiated magnetic field waves of a target resonant frequency, to power remote devices that are in proximity thereto and capable of receiving power transmitted as non-radiated magnetic fields. In this way, the wireless power transfer system can provide for automatic initiation of battery recharge operations, where recharge can occur without interruption to current operations.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">Embodiments of the present embodiment address battery power charging in-situ from a remote power source (station) using magnetic power. This approach of recharging a battery in remote devices is applicable to fairly long distance between a power source and a target device having a rechargeable battery. In some embodiments the wireless delivery of power is conducted through high frequency resonant magnetic coupling between the powers sources resonantly coupled with a target device, the target device being an electronic device that runs on a portable rechargeable battery included therein. Generally, the power source and the target device are tuned to the same frequency. This results in magnetic resonance in the target device for transmitting power wirelessly by the power source with air (or a vacuum for that matter) as the medium for power transfer.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">In accordance with one embodiment, the magnetic coupling between a magnetic field generated by a power transmitting unit and a target device enables the power transfer. The magnetic field is directed towards the target device by properly shaping the magnetic generating coil. This system can operate on the transformer principle but with air core and across a greater distance. Also in this setup the power transfer is relatively significant compared to the resonant power transfer using RF electromagnetic signals due relatively close proximity of the power source with the target device and the use of a common frequency between the power transmitting unit and a target device. For example, the system of the present embodiment may use one or more coils disposed in a computing device. The computing device can take the form of a desktop computer along the lines of an iMac™ desktop computer or a portable computer such as a MacBook Pro™ each manufactured by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. It should be noted that in addition to a discreet coil arrangement, metallic components, such as a housing used to support internal components can also be configured to act as a resonator(s).</p>
    <p num="p-0034">For example, at least a portion of the aluminum housing of the iMac™ desktop computer can be used as a resonator. In some cases, a small form factor electronic device, such as an iPhone™ can include a housing at least a portion of which is formed of metal. For example, a metallic band used to provide structural support for the iPhone4™ can be used as a single loop resonator. In this way the metal band can receive power wirelessly for both operating the electronic device and charging the battery, whichever is necessary. In another example, a metallic housing of a peripheral device, such as a mouse, can be used as resonator to provide power for operation of the mouse and/or charging the batteries used to store power for the operation of the mouse. Magnetic signals/fields created by the power source can be received by an antenna/coil of the target device. The received signals/fields charge capacitors through diodes at the target device. An array of such capacitors may be connected in series using a plurality of diodes. This array of capacitors and plurality of diodes helps in rectification of AC (alternating current) to DC (direct current) and may amplify the DC voltage to a value that is sufficient to charge a battery in the target device.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">According to an aspect of the present embodiment, the resonant power wireless transmission supports communications at least from the power transmitting unit and the target device. These communications may include information relating to the power charging or other information. Because of the strong wireless coupling between the power transmitting unit and the target device, high data rate communications may be supported by using this technique. For communications from the target device to the power transmitting unit, the same principle may be employed. However, in some embodiments, communications from the target device to the power transmitting unit may be supported by other wireless techniques such as Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) operations, e.g., IEEE 802.11x, Wireless Personal Area Network operations (WPAN) operations, e.g., Bluetooth, infrared communications, cellular communications and/or other techniques.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">In one embodiment, wireless power can be provided by at least one wireless power source having a circularly polarized source resonator. The at least one wireless power source can include a high frequency, orthogonal in-band power transmitter. The at least one wireless power source can include a base plate that provides high frequency (HF) power and at least two “D” shaped resonators. The at least two “D” shaped resonators can be driven about 180° out of phase with each other. Hence, the magnetic fields produced by the at least two “D” shaped resonators can provide a circularly polarized magnetic field. The circularly polarized magnetic field can interact with a peripheral device, such as a mouse, having a corresponding shaped base and resonator antenna. In one embodiment, the peripheral base includes electronic components that can receive power delivered wirelessly from the wireless power source. The electronic components can include a battery that can receive a charging current from the wireless power supply. Due to the circular nature of the polarization of the magnetic field, the resonant coupling between the mouse and the wireless power supply can be substantially unaffected when the mouse is moved upon a surface on which the base plate is supported. It should be noted that the circularly polarized magnetic field can be “steered” by modifying the orientation of the at least two “D” shaped magnetic fields or by modifying the orientation of the axis of the elliptical shaped magnetic field. In one implementation, a target device can take the form of a single orientation receiver.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">In one embodiment, a peripheral device can be shaped in such a way to form a resonator having a shape appropriate for interacting with the circularly polarized magnetic field emanating from the wireless power source. For example, a keyboard can have a metal stand used to support the keyboard at an ergonomically friendly angle with respect to a supporting surface. The metal stand can have a shape in accordance with the circularly polarized magnetic field formed by the at least two “D” shaped resonators. In this way, the metal stand can interact with the circularly polarized magnetic field to support wirelessly receiving power from the wireless power source.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">In another embodiment, the resonant frequency of the wireless power supply can be tuned and de-tuned to any frequency. The tuning of the resonant frequency can be done dynamically by changing a shape of at least one resonator. In one embodiment, the changing of the shape of the at least one resonator can be carried out using, for example, a piezoelectric shaping techniques. In some embodiments, parasitic capacitance can be used to tune/detune a resonator. In some cases, the wireless power transmitter can vary a center resonance frequency in order to compensate for parasitic capacitance. The dynamic tuning can be used to provide identification of the resonator. For example, when a resonator is detuned (or tuned), resonant impedance associated with the resonator will be removed (or added) to a magnetic circuit between a primary resonator in a power supply and the resonator. The change in resonant impedance can be detected by the power supply and thus that resonator associated with the change in impedance can be deduced and stored for later use.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">The dynamic tuning can also be used to arbitrate power amongst a plurality of receiving devices. For example, one or more modes can be tuned in succession followed by a query requesting a confirmation of how much power was received by those devices receiving power at a particular frequency. In this way, resonant modes not equal to the original center frequency can be determined. Hence, maximum power can be transferred at one of the determined resonant frequency. In this way, the most efficient power transfer can occur at the original center frequency but, however, the most amount of power can be transferred at one of the resonant mode frequencies. Resonant modes can be determined by nulling out a particular receiving device, using for example, a backchannel. In this way, the wireless power transmitter can look for a change in impedance when the wireless power transmitter is broadcasting on a resonant mode. In this way, by sweeping through a particular frequency band, a number of resonant modes can be determined. In some cases, resonators can be coupled together to form chained re-resonators.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">In another embodiment, conductive material can be used as a waveguide and/or magnetic flux concentrator. In particular, metallic surfaces and structures can be used to guide/concentrate high frequency resonances by, for example, boosting coupling coefficient κ. Conductive surfaces (such as table tops, computer housing, etc.) can be used a flux concentrators as well as metal housings.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">In yet another embodiment, a ground comb can be used to preferentially block magnetic flux and preferentially allow other magnetic flux to pass. The ground comb can be formed of magnetically active material in the form of fingers spaced apart to allow at least some magnetic flux to pass through the interstitial spacing. However, at least a second set of fingers can be applied across the first set of fingers for form apertures. The apertures allowing only selected portions and amounts of an incident magnetic field from passing, the remaining portions of the magnetic fields being blocked.</p>

    <p num="p-0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a wireless power delivery system <b>100</b> that includes a power transmitting unit <b>103</b> and a target electronic device <b>115</b>, wherein power is delivered wirelessly employing magnetic waves.

The power delivery system <b>101</b> includes the power transmitting unit <b>103</b>, the target electronic device <b>115</b>, and other target devices capable of receiving power being transmitted. The power transmitting unit <b>103</b> includes a power source <b>105</b> capable of generating power for power transmission and a sending resonant coupling component <b>131</b> capable of power transmission employing magnetic waves <b>111</b>, such as non-radiated magnetic field waves of a specified target resonant frequency. It also includes a source power manager <b>107</b> and a target device authenticator <b>109</b>. The power transmitting unit <b>103</b> is capable of dynamically tuning the power transmission to the target resonant frequency associated with the target electronic device <b>115</b>, wherein the target resonant frequency is specified dynamically. The power transmitting unit also includes a communication module <b>110</b> operable to send a communication signal to the target electronic device <b>115</b> via the magnetic waves <b>111</b> and/or via Radio Frequency (RF) communications <b>113</b>. The RF communications <b>113</b> may include Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) communications such as IEEE 802.11x communications, Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) communications such as Bluetooth communications, cellular communications, proprietary interface communications, or other RF communication techniques. The communication module <b>110</b> may also include a wired communication link, e.g., Local Area Network (LAN) such as Ethernet, Cable Modem, Wide Area Network (WAN) and/or other wired communication means. For example, the wired communication link could provide a high speed uplink to the Internet.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">The target electronic device <b>115</b> includes a resonant power charging module <b>117</b>, a user authorization module <b>121</b>, a source resonant frequency selector <b>123</b>, a communication module <b>125</b>, and a target device power manager <b>127</b>. The resonant power charging module <b>117</b> includes a receiving resonant coupling component <b>141</b>, a power charging controller <b>119</b>, and a rechargeable battery <b>129</b>. The receiving resonant coupling component <b>141</b>, also sometimes referred to as a receiving resonant charging component, is used to receive the power transmissions provided by the power transmitting unit <b>113</b> employing the target resonant frequency. The target electronic device <b>115</b> employs the received power for operation of the target electronic device <b>115</b> as well as for charging the rechargeable battery <b>129</b> in the target electronic device <b>115</b>. The power delivery system <b>101</b> employs the sending resonant coupling component <b>113</b> of the power transmitting unit <b>103</b> to generate magnetic fields that are used to transmit power to the target devices, such as the target electronic device <b>115</b>. Typically, the sending resonant coupling component <b>113</b> includes a resonant coil that fills the space around it with a non-radiated magnetic field oscillating at the target resonant frequency that is received by the target electronic device <b>115</b> employing the receiving resonant coupling component <b>141</b>. The target device also includes a communication module operable <b>125</b> to communicate with the communication module <b>110</b> of the power transmitting unit <b>103</b> via the magnetic coupling and/or via RF communications.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">The power transmitting unit <b>103</b> that includes the power source <b>105</b> and the target electronic device <b>115</b> are communicatively coupled with each other during the resonant power delivery from the power source <b>105</b> to the target electronic device <b>115</b>. The resonant coupling is achieved wirelessly using a ‘wireless field’ <b>111</b>, which is non-radiated magnetic field in some embodiments. The ‘wireless field’ <b>111</b> are the power delivery channel and a ‘wireless link’ <b>113</b> is the control signal channel. In one embodiment communicating the power and a control signal are conducted employing the same frequency, or in other words, on the same channel, i.e. The wireless field <b>111</b>. In another embodiment the power link (such as the magnetic field), the control signal, and the normal communication (i.e. The normal function) operation takes place in separate channels. For e.g. The power transmitting unit <b>103</b> is implemented in the base station of a mobile phone, where the normal communication operations with the mobile phone (from the base station), resonant power delivery, and the control signal transmission are all conducted between the mobile phone (as a target electronic device) and the base station employing different channels.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">The power source <b>105</b> is a module which generates the required power to be transmitted in a non-radiated magnetic or radiated magnetic mode, employing an essentially “wireless means” <b>111</b>. The power source <b>105</b> provides power to the sending resonant coupling component <b>131</b> which transmits it, for example, creating a non-radiated magnetic field. A source power manager <b>107</b> manages the wireless power transmission.</p>
    <p num="p-0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a simplified schematic diagram of another embodiment <b>200</b> of wireless power transfer system <b>100</b> described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Wireless power system <b>200</b> can include at least transmitter <b>204</b> that, in turn, includes, an oscillator <b>222</b>, a power amplifier <b>224</b> and a filter and matching circuit <b>226</b>. The oscillator is configured to generate a desired frequency, which may be adjusted in response to adjustment signal <b>223</b>. The oscillator signal may be amplified by the power amplifier <b>224</b> with an amplification amount responsive to control signal <b>225</b>. The filter and matching circuit <b>226</b> may be included to filter out harmonics or other unwanted frequencies and match the impedance of the transmitter <b>204</b> to the transmit antenna <b>214</b>. The receiver <b>208</b> may include a matching circuit <b>232</b> and a rectifier and switching circuit <b>234</b> to generate a DC power output to charge a battery <b>236</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or power a device coupled to the receiver (not shown). The matching circuit <b>232</b> may be included to match the impedance of the receiver <b>208</b> to the receive antenna <b>218</b>. The receiver <b>208</b> and transmitter <b>204</b> may communicate on a separate communication channel <b>113</b> (e.g., Bluetooth, cellular, WiFi etc).</p>
    <p num="p-0048">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, antennas used in exemplary embodiments may be configured as a “loop” antenna <b>350</b>, which may also be referred to herein as a “magnetic” antenna. Loop antennas may be configured to include an air core or a physical core such as a ferrite core. Air core loop antennas may be more tolerable to extraneous physical devices placed in the vicinity of the core. Furthermore, an air core loop antenna allows the placement of other components within the core area. Efficient transfer of energy between the transmitter <b>104</b> and receiver <b>208</b> occurs during matched or nearly matched resonance between the transmitter <b>204</b> and the receiver <b>208</b>. However, even when resonance between the transmitter <b>204</b> and receiver <b>208</b> are not matched, energy may be transferred at a lower efficiency. Transfer of energy occurs by coupling energy from the near-field of the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna residing in the neighborhood where this near-field is established rather than propagating the energy from the transmitting antenna into free space.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">The resonant frequency of the loop or magnetic antennas is based on the inductance and capacitance. Inductance in a loop antenna is generally simply the inductance created by the loop, whereas, capacitance is generally added to the loop antenna's inductance to create a resonant structure at a desired resonant frequency. As a non-limiting example, capacitor <b>352</b> and capacitor <b>354</b> may be added to the antenna to create a resonant circuit that generates resonant signal <b>356</b>. Accordingly, for larger diameter loop antennas, the size of capacitance needed to induce resonance decreases as the diameter or inductance of the loop increases. Furthermore, as the diameter of the loop or magnetic antenna increases, the efficient energy transfers area of the near-field increases. Of course, other resonant circuits are possible. As another non-limiting example, a capacitor may be placed in parallel between the two terminals of the loop antenna. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that for transmit antennas the resonant signal <b>356</b> may be an input to the loop antenna <b>350</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0050"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a simplified block diagram of transmit circuitry <b>402</b> and associated transmit antenna <b>404</b>. Generally, transmit circuitry <b>402</b> provides RF power to the transmit antenna <b>404</b> by providing an oscillating signal resulting in generation of near-field energy about the transmit antenna <b>404</b>. By way of example, transmit circuitry <b>402</b> may operate at the 13.56 MHz ISM band. Transmit circuitry <b>402</b> includes a fixed impedance matching circuit <b>406</b> for matching the impedance of the transmit circuitry <b>402</b> (e.g., 50 ohms) to the transmit antenna <b>404</b> and a low pass filter (LPF) <b>408</b> configured to reduce harmonic emissions to levels to prevent self-jamming of devices coupled to receivers <b>208</b>. Other exemplary embodiments may include different filter topologies, including but not limited to, notch filters that attenuate specific frequencies while passing others and may include an adaptive impedance match, that can be varied based on measurable transmit metrics, such as output power to the antenna or DC current draw by the power amplifier. Transmit circuitry <b>402</b> further includes a power amplifier <b>410</b> configured to drive an RF signal as determined by an oscillator <b>412</b>. The transmit circuitry may be comprised of discrete devices or circuits, or alternately, may be comprised of an integrated assembly. An exemplary RF power output from transmit antenna <b>404</b> may be on the order of 2.5 to 8.0 Watts.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">Transmit circuitry <b>402</b> further includes a controller <b>414</b> for enabling the oscillator <b>412</b> during transmit phases (or duty cycles) for specific receivers, for adjusting the frequency of the oscillator, and for adjusting the output power level for implementing a communication protocol for interacting with neighboring devices through their attached receivers. The transmit circuitry <b>402</b> may further include a load sensing circuit <b>416</b> for detecting the presence or absence of active receivers in the vicinity of the near-field generated by transmit antenna <b>404</b>. By way of example, a load sensing circuit <b>416</b> monitors the current flowing to the power amplifier <b>410</b>, which is affected by the presence or absence of active receivers in the vicinity of the near-field generated by transmit antenna <b>404</b>. Detection of changes to the loading on the power amplifier <b>410</b> are monitored by controller <b>414</b> for use in determining whether to enable the oscillator <b>412</b> for transmitting energy to communicate with an active receiver.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Transmit antenna <b>404</b> may be implemented as an antenna strip with the thickness, width and metal type selected to keep resistive losses low. In a conventional implementation, the transmit antenna <b>404</b> can generally be configured for association with a larger structure such as a table, mat, lamp or other less portable configuration. Accordingly, the transmit antenna <b>404</b> generally will not need “turns” in order to be of a practical dimension. An exemplary implementation of a transmit antenna <b>404</b> may be “electrically small” (i.e., fraction of the wavelength) and tuned to resonate at lower usable frequencies by using capacitors to define the resonant frequency. In an exemplary application where the transmit antenna <b>404</b> may be larger in diameter, or length of side if a square loop, (e.g., 0.50 meters) relative to the receive antenna, the transmit antenna <b>404</b> will not necessarily need a large number of turns to obtain a reasonable capacitance. Transmit circuitry <b>402</b> may gather and track information about the whereabouts and status of receiver devices that may be associated with the transmit circuitry <b>402</b>. Thus, the transmitter circuitry <b>402</b> may include a presence detector, an enclosed detector, or a combination thereof, connected to the controller <b>414</b> (also referred to as a processor herein).</p>
    <p num="p-0053">In one embodiment, wireless power can be provided by at least one wireless power source having a circularly polarized source resonator. More specifically, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows wireless power source <b>500</b> arranged to transfer power utilizing a circularly polarized magnetic field in accordance with the described embodiments. Wireless power source <b>500</b> can include power supply <b>502</b>. In the described embodiment, power supply <b>502</b> can take the form of high frequency, orthogonal in-band power transmitter that can supply high frequency (HF) power to base plate <b>504</b>. Base plate <b>504</b>, in turn, provides HF power to resonators <b>506</b> that can take the form of “D” shaped resonators. In this way, each of the “D” shaped resonators <b>506</b> can act as a circular polarized magnetic field source resonator that can convert at least some of the HF power provided to base plate <b>504</b> to separate component magnetic fields B<sub>1 </sub>and B<sub>2 </sub>that can combine with each other to form resulting magnetic field <b>508</b>. In a particularly useful configuration, the at least two “D” shaped resonators <b>506</b> can be driven by base plate <b>504</b> about 180° out of phase with each other such that the resulting component magnetic fields B<sub>1 </sub>and B<sub>2 </sub>are also 180° out of phase with each other. The combining of the two out of phase component magnetic fields B<sub>1 </sub>and B<sub>2 </sub>can result in a resulting magnetic field that is circularly polarized. It should be noted that with a circularly polarized magnetic field, the plane of polarization rotates in a corkscrew pattern, making one complete revolution during each wavelength. In this way, a circularly polarized wave radiates energy in both the horizontal and vertical planes and all planes in between. If the rotation is clockwise looking in the direction of propagation, the sense is called right-hand-circular (RHC). If the rotation is counterclockwise, the sense is called left-hand circular (LHC). In this way, resulting circularly polarized magnetic field <b>508</b> can be transmitted in all planes, making it more likely for a mobile device (such as a computer mouse) to be able to establish a reliable resonance link regardless of the relative antenna orientation of the mobile device and wireless power supply <b>500</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6E</figref> illustrates a basic configuration of wireless system <b>600</b> that includes wireless power supply <b>500</b> arranged to radiate circularly polarized magnetic field <b>508</b> in accordance with the described embodiments. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows that a resonant channel can be formed between wireless power supply <b>500</b> and peripheral device <b>602</b>. Peripheral device <b>602</b> can be configured as a mobile device that can be moved to any position within effective distance d of wireless power supply <b>500</b>. Effective distance d can represent a distance from wireless power supply <b>500</b> over which a useful amount of power can be received by peripheral device <b>602</b> from wireless power supply <b>500</b>. Effective distance d can range from a few centimeters to a few meters. It should be noted that effective distance d can be affected by many factors in addition to the size and shape of resonators <b>504</b> and the size and shape of resonators <b>604</b> included in peripheral device <b>602</b>. In any case, the presumption for the remainder of this discussion is that peripheral device <b>602</b> remains within maximum distance d<sub>max </sub>of wireless power supply <b>500</b> by maintaining a current distance from wireless power supply <b>500</b> that is less than distance d<sub>max </sub>at all times. It should be noted that maximum distance represents that area around power supply <b>500</b> where a minimum pre-determined amount of power P<sub>min </sub>can be wirelessly received at peripheral device <b>602</b> from power supply <b>500</b>. For example power P<sub>min </sub>can be set at 20 mW representing the least amount of power that can be transferred to peripheral device <b>602</b> in order for peripheral device <b>602</b> to operate in a fully operable manner. Of course, depending upon a current status of on-board power supplies (if any) power P<sub>min </sub>can vary thereby altering effective range D of power supply <b>500</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">Resulting magnetic field <b>508</b> can be formed by combining component magnetic fields B<sub>1 </sub>and B<sub>2 </sub>generated by resonators <b>504</b> in wireless power supply <b>500</b>. In this embodiment, peripheral device <b>602</b> can take the form of computer mouse <b>602</b>. Computer mouse <b>602</b> can include resonators <b>604</b> each having a shape factor associated with resonators <b>506</b> included in wireless power supply <b>500</b>. In other words, resonators <b>604</b> can also be “D” shaped. In this way, the interaction of “D” shaped resonators <b>604</b> can be optimized for the most efficient wireless power transmission. In addition to providing an efficient wireless power transfer, the circular polarized nature of resulting magnetic field <b>508</b> allows computer mouse <b>602</b> to maintain any spatial orientation on a supporting surface or in free space and still maintain an essentially constant power transfer between wireless power supply <b>500</b> and computer mouse <b>602</b> (as shown below).</p>
    <p num="p-0056">Accordingly, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows cross section of peripheral device <b>602</b> along line AA illustrating housing <b>606</b> coupled to base portion <b>608</b>. In particular, housing <b>606</b> can enclose resonators <b>604</b> electrically coupled to battery <b>610</b> and operational components <b>612</b> in base portion <b>608</b>. In this way, battery <b>610</b> and operational components <b>612</b> can receive a relatively constant supply of power from wireless power supply <b>500</b> by way of resonators <b>604</b>. It should be noted that in some embodiments, battery <b>610</b> is not necessary as power can be received wirelessly from wireless power supply <b>500</b> thereby obviating the need for any on-board power supply.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6C-6E</figref>, the symmetry of magnetic field <b>508</b> provides that power can be wirelessly received at peripheral device <b>602</b> at acceptable levels regardless of the orientation of peripheral device <b>602</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, peripheral device <b>602</b> in the form of mouse <b>602</b> can include resonators <b>604</b> that are substantially equal in size and at about right angles to each other. In this way, the geometry of resonators <b>604</b> can be tuned to the properties of circularly polarized magnetic field <b>508</b>. Due to the matching symmetry between circularly polarized magnetic field <b>508</b> and resonators <b>604</b>, power from power supply <b>500</b> can be received at or above an acceptable level regardless of the spatial orientation of computer mouse <b>602</b> with respect to power supply <b>500</b> (and more particularly resonators <b>504</b>). As further illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, peripheral device <b>602</b> can be rotated about ninety degrees from the orientation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> and still maintain an advantageous orientation with respect to resonators <b>506</b> in power supply <b>500</b> and resonators <b>604</b> in computer mouse <b>602</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">It should be noted that the magnetic field provided by power supply <b>500</b> can in fact take on an elliptical shape (a circle being a special case of an ellipse) as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>. Accordingly, resonators <b>604</b> in peripheral device <b>602</b> can also take on a corresponding elliptical shape thereby optimizing an amount of power transferred from power supply <b>500</b> to peripheral device <b>602</b> as well as optimizing the power transfer efficiency. It should be noted that circularly polarized magnetic field <b>508</b> can be “steered” by modifying the orientation of the at least two “D” shaped magnetic fields generated by “D” shaped resonators <b>506</b> for example, by modifying the orientation of the axes of the elliptical shaped magnetic field. It should be noted that in one implementation, the target device (which in this representation takes the form of a computer mouse) can include only a single orientation receiver that although reduces the rate of power transfer that can be achieved from using more than one resonator, but nonetheless may be a suitable solution when available space or size is a significant consideration.</p>
    <p num="p-0059"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an embodiment whereby peripheral device <b>602</b> takes on the form of keyboard <b>700</b> within maximum range D of wireless power supply <b>500</b>. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a top view of keyboard <b>700</b> having wireless power receiver unit <b>702</b> incorporated as part of the structure of keyboard <b>700</b>. For example, keyboard <b>700</b> can be formed of metal such as aluminum. Wireless power receiver unit <b>702</b> can include at least one resonator <b>704</b>. In a particular embodiment, resonator <b>704</b> can take the form of a “D” shaped resonator matching resonator <b>504</b> in wireless power supply <b>500</b>. In this way, keyboard <b>700</b> can wirelessly receive power by way of circularly polarized magnetic field <b>508</b> regardless of the orientation of keyboard <b>700</b> with respect to wireless power supply <b>500</b>. It should be noted, however, that in some situations, wireless power supply <b>500</b> can be incorporated in another device, such as computing system <b>706</b>. In this situation, the actual spatial orientation of keyboard <b>700</b> with respect to computing system <b>706</b> is quite limited (unlike that of a computer mouse). Therefore, resonator <b>704</b> can be limited to a single “D” shaped resonator that can be fabricated as part of keyboard <b>700</b> without significant adverse effect on the ability of keyboard <b>700</b> from receiving at least an amount of power sufficient for full operation of keyboard <b>700</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">In yet another embodiment, ground comb <b>800</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> can be used to selectively block some magnetic flux and preferentially allow other magnetic flux to pass. Ground comb <b>800</b> can be formed of magnetically active material in the form of first set of fingers <b>802</b> spaced apart to allow at least some magnetic flux B to pass through interstitial spacing. However, at least second set of fingers <b>804</b> can be applied across first set of fingers <b>802</b> for form apertures <b>806</b>.

    <p num="p-0061">It should be noted that by varying the geometry of the resonators, the resonant frequency of the wireless power supply can be tuned and de-tuned to any frequency. In one embodiment, the tuning of the resonant frequency can be done dynamically by changing a shape of at least one resonator. In one embodiment, the changing of the shape of the at least one resonator can be carried out using, for example, a piezoelectric shaping techniques. In some embodiment, parasitic capacitance can be used to tune/detune a resonator. In some cases, the wireless power transmitter can vary a center resonance frequency in order to compensate for parasitic capacitance.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a flowchart detailing process <b>900</b> for determining a resonant frequency of a magnetic power transfer system in accordance with the described embodiments. Process <b>900</b> can begin at <b>902</b> by providing a magnetic field at a frequency. In the described embodiment, the frequency of the magnetic field can be based at least in part upon the characteristic sizes of the constituents of the magnetic power transfer system. For example, the characteristic size of the power resonator as well as any of the receiving resonators can be used to determine the magnetic field frequency. In addition to the characteristic size, the amount of power to be transferred can also affect the frequency as more power may require a higher frequency. One the magnetic field has been provided at the frequency, an indication of an amount of power wirelessly received at a receiver is obtained at <b>904</b>. The indication can be obtained using a communication channel (sometimes referred to as a back channel) using any suitable manner of communication such as WiFi™, Bluetooth, and so on. Once the indication of the amount of power received has been obtained, a determination is made at <b>906</b> if the amount of power received is indicative of a maximum power. The determination can be based upon a pre-determined power amount that has been designated as a maximum power for the particular system or the determination can be based upon a comparison of previous indications of received power.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">In any case, if it is determined that the received amount of power is not maximum, then the frequency is updated at <b>908</b> and control is passed back to <b>902</b>. The updating of the frequency can be accomplished in many ways. For example, the frequency can be updated by varying the geometry of the resonators. In this way, the resonant frequency of the wireless power supply can be tuned and de-tuned to any frequency. In one embodiment, the tuning of the resonant frequency can be done dynamically by changing a shape of at least one resonator. In one embodiment, the changing of the shape of the at least one resonator can be carried out using, for example, a piezoelectric shaping techniques. In some embodiment, parasitic capacitance can be used to tune/detune a resonator. In some cases, the wireless power transmitter can vary a center resonance frequency in order to compensate for parasitic capacitance. On the other hand, if the power received is determined to be maximum, that at <b>910</b> the frequency is the resonant frequency and process <b>900</b> ends.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">The dynamic tuning can also be used to arbitrate power amongst a plurality of receiving devices. For example, one or more nodes can be tuned in succession followed by a query requesting a confirmation of how much power was received by those devices receiving power at a particular frequency. In this way, resonant modes not equal to the original center frequency can be determined. Hence, maximum power can be transferred at one of the determined resonant frequency. In this way, the most efficient power transfer can occur at the original center frequency but, however, the most amount of power can be transferred at one of the other resonant mode frequencies. Resonant modes can be determined by nulling out a particular receiving device, using for example, a backchannel. In this way, the wireless power transmitter can look for a change in impedance when the wireless power transmitter is broadcasting on a resonant mode. In this way, by sweeping through a particular frequency band, a number of resonant modes can be determined. In some cases, resonators can be coupled together to form chained re-resonators.</p>
    <p num="p-0065"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows representative virtual charging area <b>1000</b> in accordance with the described embodiments. Virtual charging area <b>1000</b> provides region R of charging for suitably configured devices placed within the region R. NFMR power supply can be placed in central unit such as desktop computer. In this way, the desktop computer can provide the NFMR power supply with computing resources. It should be noted that the near field magnetic resonance (NFMR) power supply can include high Q circuit that relies upon near field magnetic coupling by way of a resonance channel formed between resonances of the power source and sink to transfer power. The NFMR power supply can be a standalone unit such as, for example, included in a desk top computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, and so on. In other embodiments, the NFMR power supply can take the form of a portable type unit such as a dongle that can be connected to a legacy device such as a desktop computer thereby providing the ability to retrofit devices. In still other embodiments, housing or a portion of a housing used to enclose the NFMR power source can act to extend a useful range of the NFMR power supply.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">In this way, suitably configured peripheral devices can be powered directly from the NFMR power supply. In so doing, the peripheral devices when tuned to the appropriate frequency can receive power wirelessly from the NFMR power supply. In so doing, the appropriately tuned peripheral device can be considered to be part of a resonance circuit that can include the NFMR power supply and any other peripheral devices so tuned. As part of such a circuit, each device has associated with it a corresponding load that can be sensed by the NFMR power supply. As such, the resonance circuit can have a characteristic load that can change by the addition or deletion of devices from the resonance circuit. For example, if a suitably configured device such as a portable media player is brought within range of the NFMR power supply, then the load associated with the portable media player can be sensed by the NFMR power supply when (and if) the portable media player is appropriately tuned. It should be noted that in some cases, the device being brought into the range of the NFMR power supply can communicate its initial presence using a standard communication protocol such as WiFi or Bluetooth. However, once incorporated into the resonance circuit, the device can use a communication back channel described in detail below. Accordingly, any change in the characteristic load factor of the resonance circuit can convey information that can be used by the NFMR power supply to control the various devices in the resonance circuit by, for example, distributing power, and so on.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">In some embodiments, certain of the peripheral devices can be configured to include a re-resonator circuit that can receive power directly from the NFMR power supply. Such devices can also transfer a portion of the power received to other of the peripheral devices. Virtual charging area <b>1000</b> includes central unit <b>1002</b> (desktop computer) that can include the NFMR power supply, keyboard <b>1004</b>, mouse <b>1006</b>, and portable media player <b>1008</b>. In one embodiment, keyboard <b>1004</b> can be configured to receive power directly from the NFMR power supply included in desktop computer <b>1002</b> as can mouse <b>1006</b> and portable media player <b>1008</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">In some cases, the ability of desktop computer <b>1002</b> to provide power directly to mouse <b>1006</b>, for example, can be reduced due to any number of factors. Such factors can include, for example, the addition of other devices into region R that require power from the NFMR power supply, obstacles interfering with the direct power channel formed between the NFMR and mouse <b>1006</b>, and so on. In this case, keyboard <b>1004</b> can act as a re-resonator such that a portion of the power delivered to keyboard <b>1004</b> from the NFMR power supply can be passed on by way of a re-resonator transmission unit (not shown) in keyboard <b>1004</b>. In this way, any power loss experienced by mouse <b>1006</b> can be ameliorated by the power received from keyboard <b>1004</b>. This arrangement can be transitory or can last for as long as mouse <b>1006</b> is not able to receive adequate power directly from the NFMR power supply. In other cases, the locating of portable media player <b>1008</b> within region R can reduce the amount of power available to keyboard <b>1004</b> and mouse <b>1006</b>. In this case, if a battery in keyboard <b>1006</b> is fully charged (or additional charge is not necessary) then keyboard <b>1006</b> can decouple a charging circuit while still maintaining a re-resonator circuit providing power to mouse <b>1006</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">It should be noted that conductive material <b>1012</b> can be used as a waveguide and/or magnetic flux concentrator. In particular, metallic surfaces and structures can be used to guide/concentrate high frequency resonances by, for example, boosting coupling coefficient k. Conductive surfaces (such as table tops, computer housing, etc.) can be used a flux concentrators as well as metal housings.</p>
