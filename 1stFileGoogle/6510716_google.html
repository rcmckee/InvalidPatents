    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to a drum type washing machine, and more particularly, to a structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine.</p>
    <p>2. Background of the Invention</p>
    <p>In general, a drum type washing, making washing by using friction between a drum rotated by a motor and laundry in a state detergent, washing water, and the laundry are introduced into the drum, provides effects of beating and rubbing washing, but gives almost no damage to the laundry, and shows no entangling of the laundry. A structure of a related art drum washing machine will be explained with reference to FIG. <b>1</b>. FIG. 1 illustrates a longitudinal section of a related art drum type washing machine, provided with a tub <b>2</b> mounted inside of a cabinet <b>1</b>, a drum <b>3</b> rotatably mounted on a central portion of inside of the tub <b>2</b>. There is a motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>under the tub <b>2</b> connected with a pulley <b>18</b>. There is a drum shaft <b>25</b> connected to a rear of the drum <b>3</b>, to which a drum pulley <b>19</b> is coupled. And, the drum pulley <b>19</b> on the drum shaft and the motor pulley <b>18</b> connected to the motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>are connected by a belt <b>20</b> for transmission of power. And, there is a door <b>21</b> in a front part of the cabinet <b>1</b>, with a gasket <b>22</b> between the door <b>21</b> and the tub <b>2</b>. There is a hanging spring <b>23</b> between an inside of an upper portion of the cabinet <b>1</b> and an outside of an upper portion of the tub <b>2</b>, and a friction damper <b>24</b> between an inside of a lower portion of the cabinet <b>1</b> and a lower side of an outside of the tub <b>2</b> for damping vibration of the tub <b>2</b> generated during spinning. There is a detergent container <b>26</b> in the upper front of the cabinet <b>1</b>, and in the upper back of the cabinet <b>1</b> is a water supply valve <b>27</b> for supplying water to the detergent container.</p>
    <p>However, the related art washing machine has the following disadvantages since driving power of the motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>is transmitted to the drum <b>3</b> through the motor pulley <b>18</b>, and the drum pulley <b>19</b>, and the belt <b>20</b> connecting the motor pulley <b>18</b> and the drum pulley <b>19</b>.</p>
    <p>First, there is a loss of energy in a course of driving power transmission because the driving power is transmitted from the motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>to the drum <b>3</b>, not directly, but through the belt <b>20</b> wound around the motor pulley <b>18</b> and the drum pulley <b>19</b>.</p>
    <p>And, the driving power transmission from the motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>to the drum <b>3</b>, not directly, but through many components, such as the belt <b>20</b>, the motor pulley <b>18</b>, and the drum pulley <b>19</b>, causes much noise in the course of power transmission.</p>
    <p>The lots of components required for transmission of driving power from the motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>to the drum <b>3</b>, such as the motor pulley <b>18</b>, the drum pulley <b>19</b> and the belt <b>20</b>, require many assembly man-hours. And, the more the number of components required for transmission of driving power from the motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>to the drum <b>3</b>, the more number of spots which require repair, and the more frequent at which repair required. The imbalance caused by the motor mounted to a lower part of rear of the tub <b>2</b> causes heavy vibration when the motor is rotated. Consequently, there is a weight balancer of metal or cement separately provided to an opposite position of the motor for system balancing.</p>
    <p>In summary, the indirect driving power transmission from the motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>to the drum <b>3</b> through the motor pulley, the drum pulley, and the belt requires many repair, has much noise, waste of energy, and results in a deterioration of a washing capability.</p>

    <p>Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the drum type washing machine in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a tub <b>2</b> of a metal inside of a cabinet (not shown) for storage of water, a drum <b>3</b> inside of the tub <b>2</b>, a shaft <b>4</b> connected to the drum <b>3</b> for transmission of a driving force from a motor <b>5</b> to the drum <b>3</b>, a front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and a rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>respectively fitted to outer circumferences of both ends of the shaft <b>4</b>, a bearing housing <b>7</b> mounted to a rear wall <b>200</b> of the tub <b>2</b> for supporting the front and rear bearings, a rotor <b>13</b> mounted to a rear end of the shaft <b>4</b> to form a motor <b>5</b> together with a stator, the stator <b>14</b> on an inner side of the rotor <b>13</b> mounted to a rear wall <b>200</b> of the tub to form the motor together with the rotor, and a connector <b>16</b> serration coupled to the shaft <b>4</b> at a rear side of the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>and fastened to the rotor <b>13</b> for transmission of a rotating force from the rotor to the shaft <b>4</b>. The bearing housing <b>7</b> is formed of a metal, preferably aluminum alloy. There is a hub <b>700</b> formed as one unit with the bearing housing <b>7</b> at a center thereof for fitting the front and rear bearings therein, and fastening bosses <b>701</b> formed on an outer side of the hub <b>700</b> at fixed intervals along a circumference for fastening the stator <b>14</b> to the bearing housing <b>7</b> with fastening members <b>15</b>d such that the bearing housing <b>7</b> looks like a semipalmate tripod in overall as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. In this instance, there is a step <b>8</b> <i>a </i>and <b>8</b> <i>b </i>formed in an inside circumference of the hub <b>700</b> on a central portion of the bearing housing <b>7</b> at each end of the hub <b>700</b> for supporting the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>so that respective bearings do not fall off, but are held therein. The step <b>8</b> <i>a </i>in the front has a form of “┐” for holding a rear end of the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, and the step <b>8</b> <i>b </i>in the rear has a form of “└” for holding a front end of the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b</i>. And, there are positioning steps <b>9</b> <i>a </i>and <b>9</b> <i>b </i>at front and rear circumferences of the shaft <b>4</b> for positioning the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>on the shaft <b>4</b>, respectively. The shaft <b>4</b> has a fore end held in a spider <b>10</b> in the rear wall of the drum <b>3</b>, an exposed portion from a rear end of the spider <b>10</b> to the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>having a bushing <b>11</b> of brass press fit thereon for prevention of rusting, with a sealing member <b>12</b> fitted on an outer circumference thereof for prevention of ingress of water, and a rear end having the rotor <b>13</b> of a direct coupling type motor <b>5</b> mounted on a center thereof. In this instance, a crown formed stator <b>14</b> is positioned on an inner side of the rotor <b>13</b>, fastened to the fastening bosses <b>701</b> on the bearing housing <b>7</b> to form the direct coupling type motor in combination with the rotor <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, referring to FIGS. 4 to <b>6</b>, the rotor <b>13</b>, formed of a magnetic material, such as iron or iron alloy, has a rear wall <b>13</b> <i>a</i>, a side wall <b>13</b> <i>b</i>, and permanent magnets <b>13</b> <i>c </i>provided on the side wall. The side wall <b>13</b> <i>b </i>extending from a periphery of the rear wall <b>13</b> <i>a </i>and serving as a back yoke that forms a magnetic flux path comprises a magnet setting surface <b>130</b>, a bent portion formed along a circumference thereof for supporting magnets <b>13</b> <i>c </i>fitted to an inside surface thereof and for reinforcing the rotor <b>13</b>. And, there is a hub <b>132</b> at a center of the rear wall <b>13</b> <i>a </i>having a through hole <b>131</b> for passing of a fastening member <b>15</b> <i>a </i>for preventing fall off of the shaft <b>4</b> from the connector <b>16</b> fixed to the rotor <b>13</b> from the shaft <b>4</b>. The rotor <b>13</b> is preferably formed by pressing. That is, the rotor <b>13</b> is formed by pressing as a unit both with the side wall <b>13</b> <i>b </i>having the magnet setting surface and the rear wall <b>13</b> <i>a </i>serving as a frame for supporting the side wall, without any separate additional fabrication process.</p>
    <p>In general, the drum washing machine may cause a problem of temperature rise owing to a load since the drum and laundry should be run fast together. Therefore, there are a plurality of cooling fins around the hub <b>132</b> of the rotor <b>13</b> as a unit with the rotor <b>13</b> in a radial direction for blowing air toward the stator <b>14</b> in rotation of the rotor <b>13</b> to cool down a heat generated at the stator <b>14</b>. Each of the cooling fins <b>133</b> has a length in the radial direction. The cooling fin <b>133</b> is formed by lancing, to be bent at approx. 90° from the rear wall <b>13</b> <i>a </i>to direct toward opening, to form an opening <b>134</b> which serves as a vent hole. Accordingly, formation of the cooling fin <b>133</b> and formation of the vent hole are done by one process, different from a case when the formation of the vent hole is done by punching, thereby permitting saving in material and working hours as no separate component and process for forming the cooling fin is required.</p>
    <p>And, different from BLDC motors used in VCR(Video Cassette Recorder) and the like, since the BLDC motor employed in the washing machine runs fast under a great load, a shape of the rotor is liable to deform during rotation of the rotor, which causes a non-uniform gap between the rotor and the stator. In order to eliminate this problem, there is an embossing <b>135</b> between every adjacent cooling fins <b>133</b> for reinforcing the rotor <b>13</b> together with the foregoing setting surface <b>130</b>. Moreover, there is a channel sectioned rim <b>13</b> <i>d </i>at an end of the rotor for stiffening the end for maintaining a true circle even if the rotor <b>13</b> rotates at a high speed. And, there is a draining hole <b>136</b> in the embossing <b>135</b> for discharge of water. And, there are fastening holes <b>137</b> for fastening the connector <b>16</b> serration coupled to an outer circumference of the shaft <b>4</b> at a rear end thereof exposed at a rear of the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>and the positioning holes <b>138</b> for fixing a position of assembly of the connector <b>16</b>, both of which are formed around the through hole <b>131</b> in the hub <b>132</b> of the rotor <b>13</b> at fixed intervals. The connector <b>16</b> is formed of a resin which has a vibration mode different from the body of the rotor <b>13</b> of iron or iron alloy, for attenuating a vibration occurred in rotation of the drum. The fastening hole <b>137</b> and the positioning hole <b>138</b> in the connector <b>16</b> have diameters different from each other.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. <b>2</b>,<b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, the connector <b>16</b> has fastening holes <b>162</b> in correspondence to the fastening holes in the hub <b>132</b> of the rotor <b>13</b> along a circumference of a periphery thereof, and positioning projections between adjacent fastening holes <b>162</b> for automatic match between the fastening holes <b>137</b> in the rotor <b>13</b> and the fastening holes <b>162</b> in the connector <b>16</b> as the positioning projections <b>160</b> are inserted into the positioning holes <b>138</b> in the connector <b>13</b>. And, there is serration <b>164</b> in an inside circumference of the hub <b>163</b> of the connector <b>16</b> matched to the serration <b>400</b> in the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b>, and there are reinforcing ribs <b>161</b> on an outer side of the hub <b>163</b> of the connector <b>16</b> for reinforcing the hub <b>163</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 2 and 7, the stator <b>14</b>, forming the motor <b>5</b> together with the rotor <b>13</b>, includes a plurality of magnetic cores <b>145</b> formed by stacking magnetic laminations and each having a salient pole <b>141</b> projected outward in a radial direction, coils <b>142</b> wound around the salient poles <b>141</b>, a frame <b>140</b> of insulating material for covering top and bottom surfaces of a magnetic core assembly of the magnetic cores <b>145</b>, and fastening ribs <b>143</b> with fastening holes <b>143</b> <i>a </i>for fixing the stator <b>14</b> to the bearing housing <b>7</b>, the fastening ribs <b>143</b> formed as one unit with the frame <b>140</b> and projected inward in a radial direction.</p>
    <p>There are tub brackets <b>17</b> welded to an outer circumference of the tub <b>2</b> for fixing the bearing housing <b>7</b> at a rear portion of the tub, and fastening holes <b>170</b> at rear ends of the tub brackets <b>17</b> for passing of fastening members <b>15</b> <i>d </i>fastened to the fastening holes <b>702</b> formed in an end portion of the bearing housing <b>7</b> in a radial direction.</p>
    <p>The operation of the aforementioned structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained.</p>
    <p>Upon rotation of the rotor <b>13</b> as a current flows to the coils <b>142</b> of the stator <b>14</b> in a sequence under the control of a motor driving controller in a panel part(not shown), the shaft <b>4</b> serration coupled to the connector <b>16</b> which is in turn connected to the rotor is rotated, to rotate the drum <b>3</b> as a power is transmitted to the drum through the shaft <b>4</b>.</p>
    <p>The assembly process of the first embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine of the present invention will be explained.</p>
    <p>First, the drum <b>3</b> is placed inside of the tub <b>2</b>. In this instance, the bushing <b>11</b> is press fit on an exposed portion of the shaft from rear of the spider <b>10</b> to the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>for prevention of rusting of the shaft, and the sealing member <b>12</b> is fitted on the bushing <b>11</b> for prevention of ingress of water toward the bearing. Then, the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>is inserted on the shaft <b>4</b> in a state the drum <b>3</b> is placed inside of the tub <b>2</b>. After insertion of the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, the bearing housing <b>7</b> is fixed to the rear of the tub as the fastening member <b>15</b> <i>d </i>passes through the fastening hole <b>170</b> in the tub bracket <b>17</b> welded to outer circumference of the tub <b>2</b> and fastened to the fastening hole <b>702</b> in the bearing housing <b>7</b>. After completion of mounting of the bearing housing <b>7</b> to the tub <b>2</b>, the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>is fitted to the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b>. In this instance, the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>is held at the step <b>9</b> <i>b </i>in rear portion of the shaft <b>4</b> and the step <b>8</b> <i>b </i>inside of the bearing housing <b>7</b> at an end thereof. In this condition, after the fastening holes <b>143</b> <i>a </i>in the fastening ribs <b>143</b> of the stator are aligned with the fastening bosses <b>701</b> on the bearing housing <b>7</b> on the outer side of the hub <b>700</b> at fixed intervals along a circumference, the stator is fastened to the fastening bosses <b>701</b> with the fastening members <b>15</b> <i>c</i>, to fix the stator <b>14</b> to the bearing housing <b>7</b>, firmly. Then, after an assembly of the rotor <b>13</b> and the connector <b>16</b>, which assembly is done separately, is inserted onto the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b>, the fastening member <b>15</b> <i>a </i>is fastened, to prevent the connector <b>16</b> from falling off the shaft by a fastening force of the fastening member <b>15</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>The assembly process of the rotor <b>13</b> and the connector <b>16</b> will be explained.</p>
    <p>First, the positioning holes <b>138</b> in the rotor <b>13</b> and the positioning projections <b>160</b> on the connector <b>16</b> are aligned, and the positioning projections <b>160</b> on the connector <b>16</b> are inserted into the positioning holes <b>138</b> in the rotor <b>13</b>. In this temporary assembly when the positioning projections <b>160</b> on the connector <b>16</b> are merely inserted into the positioning holes <b>138</b> in the rotor <b>13</b>, the fastening holes <b>137</b> in the rotor <b>13</b> and the fastening holes <b>162</b> in the connector <b>16</b> are aligned, under which condition, the fastening members <b>15</b> <i>b </i>are fastened through the fastening holes <b>137</b> and <b>162</b>, to assemble the rotor <b>13</b> and the connector <b>16</b> together.</p>
    <p>The operation of the structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention assembled thus will be explained.</p>
    <p>The bearing housing <b>7</b> of a metal, such as aluminum alloy, is applicable to the drum type washing machine which has a drying cycle since the bearing housing <b>7</b> shows no thermal deformation even at a high temperature. The “┐” formed step <b>8</b> <i>a </i>in the front, and the “└” formed step <b>8</b> <i>b </i>in the rear of the inside circumference of the bearing housing <b>7</b> hold a rear end of the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and a front end of the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>fitted on outer circumferences of the shaft <b>4</b> at both ends thereof, respectively. The positioning steps <b>9</b> <i>a </i>and <b>9</b> <i>b </i>in outer circumferences of a front portion and a rear portion of the shaft <b>4</b> permit to fix positions of the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>with respect to the shaft <b>4</b>. In the meantime, the front end of the shaft <b>4</b> is fixed in the spider <b>10</b> mounted to a rear wall of the drum <b>3</b>, the exposed portion of the shaft from rear of the spider <b>10</b> to the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>has the bushing <b>11</b> press fit thereon for prevention of rusting of the shaft, and the sealing member <b>12</b> is fitted on the bushing <b>11</b> for prevention of ingress of water toward the bearing. The fastening bosses <b>701</b> on the bearing housing <b>7</b> on the outer side of the hub <b>700</b> at fixed intervals along a circumference permits the stator <b>14</b> to be fastened to the fastening bosses <b>701</b> with the fastening members <b>15</b> <i>c</i>, to fix the stator <b>14</b> to the bearing housing <b>7</b>, firmly. And, the rotor <b>13</b> of the direct coupling type motor <b>5</b> is fixed to the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b>, and the bent part having the magnet setting surface <b>30</b> formed along a circumference of the sidewall <b>13</b> <i>b </i>extended forward from a periphery of the rear wall <b>13</b> <i>a </i>of the rotor <b>13</b> supports the magnets <b>13</b> <i>c </i>attached to the rotor <b>13</b>, thereby permitting an easy fabrication of the rotor. The through hole <b>131</b> in the hub <b>132</b> at a center of the rear wall <b>13</b> <i>a </i>of the rotor <b>13</b> permits to fasten the fastening members <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, such as bolts, to the rear end of the shaft for prevention of falling of the shaft <b>4</b> off the rotor <b>13</b> and the connector <b>16</b> coupled to the rotor <b>13</b>, and the plurality of cooling fins <b>133</b> formed around the hub <b>132</b> of the rotor <b>13</b> in a radial direction each with a length blow air toward the stator <b>14</b> when the rotor <b>13</b> is rotated, thereby cooling down the heat generated at the stator <b>14</b>. The cooling fin <b>133</b> formed to direct the open side of the rotor <b>13</b> by lancing forms the through hole <b>134</b> which serves as a vent hole. The body of the rotor <b>13</b> formed of iron or iron alloy by pressing reduces a fabrication time period very much, to improve a productivity of the rotor. The embossing <b>135</b> between adjacent cooling fins <b>133</b> on the rear wall <b>13</b> <i>a </i>of the rotor improve an overall strength of the rotor <b>13</b>, and the draining hole <b>136</b> in the embossing <b>135</b> permits to discharge water. The fastening holes <b>137</b> for fastening the connector and the positioning holes <b>138</b> for fixing a position of assembly of the connector <b>16</b>, both of which are formed around the through hole <b>131</b> in the hub <b>132</b> of the rotor <b>13</b> permits to assemble the connector <b>16</b>, serration coupled to the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b> exposed in rear of the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b</i>, and the rotor <b>13</b> with easy. Once the positioning projections on the connector <b>16</b> are aligned with the positioning holes <b>138</b> in the rotor <b>13</b>, the fastening holes <b>137</b> and <b>162</b> in both of the rotor <b>13</b> and the connector <b>16</b> are aligned automatically, through which the fastening members <b>15</b> <i>b </i>are fastened, to assemble the connector <b>16</b> and the rotor <b>13</b> with easy. In this instance, the connector <b>16</b> of a resin injection molding has a vibration mode different from the same of the rotor <b>13</b> of iron or iron alloy, to attenuate the vibration from the rotor <b>13</b> to the shaft <b>4</b>. The serration <b>164</b> on an inside circumference of the hub <b>163</b> of the connector <b>16</b> is fitted to the serration <b>400</b> on the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b>, to transmit a rotation force from the rotor <b>13</b> to the shaft <b>4</b> as it is. There is a cylindrical outer rib <b>165</b> spaced from the outer circumference of the hub <b>163</b>, an end of which is brought into close contact with the rotor for being held, firmly. A space <b>166</b> formed between the hub <b>163</b> and the outer rib <b>165</b> cuts off transmission of vibration from the shaft to the rotor or vice versa. The reinforcing ribs <b>161</b> in the space <b>166</b> connecting the hub <b>163</b> and the outer ribs <b>167</b> permits an overall strength of the connector <b>16</b> to be adequate.</p>
    <p>A structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 10 and 11. FIG. 10 illustrates a longitudinal section of key parts of a structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 11 illustrates a right side view of FIG. 10 having a motor removed therefrom. Second embodiment components identical to the first embodiment will be given the same reference symbols, and explanations of which will be omitted. The second embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine of the present invention further includes an arc formed baffle <b>703</b> on an upper portion of outer side of the rotor <b>13</b> mounted to the bearing housing <b>7</b> for prevention of ingress of water into a motor <b>5</b>, which water is dropped from a water supply valve <b>27</b> when the water supply valve <b>27</b> is out of order. The arc formed baffle <b>703</b> has a length connecting both ends of the arc greater than a diameter of the rotor <b>13</b>. Provided that the baffle <b>703</b> is formed to have a length enough to project an end thereof beyond a rear of the sidewall <b>13</b> <i>b </i>of the rotor, though it does not matter that an angle θ between the rear wall <b>200</b> of the tub and a top surface of the baffle <b>703</b> is 90° or greater than 90°, it is preferable that the angle θ us smaller than 90°.</p>
    <p>The operation of the aforementioned structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained.</p>
    <p>In the related art, since the motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>is mounted to a lower portion of the tub <b>2</b>, chances are low that water will invade into the motor <b>5</b> <i>a </i>even if water drops leak from the water supply valve <b>25</b>. But in a drum type washing machine with the structure of a driving unit of the present invention, since the motor <b>5</b> is mounted to a rear of the tub <b>2</b>, if the water supply valve <b>27</b> gets out of order and water leaks, the leaking water is liable to fall toward the motor <b>5</b> an invade into it, which should be prevented. In order to prevent this in the present invention, the arc formed baffle <b>703</b> is provided to surround the rotor from an outer upper side of the rotor in the bearing housing <b>7</b> for prevention of the water flow toward the motor <b>5</b>, thereby securing a reliability of the motor without shifting a position of the water supply valve <b>27</b>. It is preferable that the angle θ between the rear wall <b>200</b> of the tub <b>2</b> and the top surface of the baffle <b>703</b> is less than 90° so that the water flows on the rear wall, but the angle θ does not matter as far as a length of the baffle <b>703</b> from a fixed end to a free end is enough to cover the sidewall <b>13</b> <i>b </i>of the rotor.</p>
    <p>A structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine in accordance with a third preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. <b>12</b>.

Then, under a condition that the fastening holes <b>203</b> for fastening the supporting bracket formed in the hub <b>201</b> of the tub <b>2</b> and the fastening holes <b>801</b> in the supporting bracket <b>8</b> are aligned, the fastening members <b>15</b> <i>d </i>are fastened, to fix the supporting bracket <b>8</b> to the hub <b>201</b> of the tub <b>2</b>. After assembly of the supporting bracket <b>8</b> to the tub <b>2</b>, the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>is inserted onto the shaft <b>4</b> through the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b> until the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>is held both at the step <b>9</b> <i>b </i>in a rear portion of the shaft <b>4</b> and the step <b>800</b> in an inside end of the supporting bracket <b>8</b>. Then, the fastening holes <b>802</b> in the periphery of the supporting bracket <b>8</b> and the fastening holes <b>143</b> <i>a </i>in the fastening rib <b>143</b> of the stator <b>14</b> are aligned, and fastened with the fastening members <b>15</b> <i>c</i>. Under this condition, an assembly of the rotor <b>13</b> and the connector <b>16</b> are inserted into the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b>, and the fastening member <b>15</b> <i>a </i>is screwed into the rear end of the shaft, for preventing the connector <b>16</b> from falling off the shaft by a fastening force of the fastening member <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, thereby fixing the stator <b>14</b> to the supporting bracket <b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>The operation of the structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine in accordance with a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained.</p>
    <p>In the fourth embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine of the present invention, since the supporting bracket <b>8</b> is formed of a metal, such as aluminum alloy, which is involved in no thermal deformation even at a high temperature, the supporting bracket <b>8</b> is applicable to the drum type washing machine which has a drying cycle. That is, the step <b>800</b> in an inside end of the supporting bracket <b>8</b> in the fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention permits to support the front end of the rear bearing <b>6</b> <i>b</i>. And, the positioning steps <b>9</b> <i>a </i>and <b>9</b> <i>b </i>in outer circumferences of front and rear portions of the shaft <b>4</b> disposed inside of the supporting bracket <b>8</b> for transmission of a driving force from the motor <b>5</b> to the drum <b>3</b> permit easy positioning of the front and rear bearings <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>with respect to the shaft <b>4</b>. In the meantime, the front end of the shaft <b>4</b> is fixed to the spider <b>10</b> in the rear wall of the drum <b>3</b>, and a portion of the shaft <b>4</b> from an end of the spider <b>10</b> to the front bearing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>has a bushing <b>11</b> of brass press fit thereon, for prevention of rusting of the shaft <b>4</b>. And, the sealing member <b>12</b> on an outer circumference of the bushing <b>11</b> prevents ingress of water into the bearing. The fastening holes <b>802</b> in the periphery of the supporting bracket <b>8</b> at fixed intervals along a circumference permit the fastening members <b>15</b> <i>c </i>passed through the fastening holes <b>143</b> <i>a </i>in the fastening ribs <b>143</b> on the stator <b>14</b> to pass through the fastening holes <b>802</b> in the supporting bracket, thereby permitting the stator <b>14</b> fixed to the supporting bracket <b>8</b>, firmly. As the serration <b>164</b> on the inside circumference of the hub <b>201</b> of the connector <b>16</b> is fitted to the serration <b>400</b> on the rear end of the shaft <b>4</b>, a rotation force can be transmitted from the rotor <b>13</b> to the shaft <b>4</b> through the connector <b>16</b> as it is. Since the supporting bracket <b>8</b> is fastened to the hub <b>201</b> projected forward from a central portion of the rear wall <b>200</b> of the tub in a face to face contact, and the stator <b>14</b> is fixed to the supporting bracket <b>8</b>, a distance from the rear wall <b>200</b> of the tub to the stator <b>14</b> is very close, which permits to minimize a distance from the rear wall <b>200</b> of the tub to the rear wall <b>13</b> <i>a </i>of the rotor, that permits to provide a compact product.</p>
    <p>As has been explained, the structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine of the present invention has the following advantages.</p>

    <p>And, the second embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine can prevent ingress of water dropped from the water supply valve <b>27</b> into the motor by means of the arc formed baffle on an upper portion of the bearing housing, thereby assuring a motor reliability.</p>
    <p>And, the third embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine permits assembly of the stator with easy when the stator is mounted to the rear of the bearing housing owing to the self alignment action of the ribs.</p>
    <p>And, the fourth embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine can also reduce noise, trouble from being out of order, and a power loss as it is of the motor direct coupling type.</p>
    <p>And, the fourth embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine can be applied to a product with a dry function as the supporting bracket of a metal shows no thermal deformation.</p>
    <p>And, the fourth embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine can prevent ingress of water dropped from the water supply valve into the motor <b>5</b> by means of the arc formed baffle provided at a rear of the tub, thereby assuring a reliability of the motor.</p>
    <p>Thus, since the drum type washing machine of the present invention can improve a structure of a driving unit, to permit direct transmission of a driving force from the motor to the drum directly, noise and trouble as well as a power loss can be reduced, to improve a productivity of the rotor and the product.</p>
