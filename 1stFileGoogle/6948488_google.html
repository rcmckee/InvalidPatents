The support arm is coupled to a cable guide of the bow through linkage that causes the support arm to rise relative to the riser of the bow as the cable is drawn to launch an arrow. As the cable is released to launch an arrow, the arrow rest drops to allow the fletching to pass the arrow rest without contact. In addition, as the arrow rest moves from a first resting position to a second pre-launch position and back again, a clamping mechanism grasps the shaft of the arrow when the support arm is in the resting position. As the support arm moves to the pre-launch position, the clamping mechanism releases the shaft of the arrow so that the arrow can be freely launched from the support arm without interference from the clamping mechanism.</div>

<heading>CROSS-REFERENCED TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of and claims priority to co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/121,123, filed on Apr. 11, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,681,753.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates to an apparatus for supporting the shaft of an arrow when launched from an archery bow. More particularly, the present invention relates to an arrow rest that can move from a first, resting position to a second ready position as the sting of the bow is drawn to a firing position. In the resting position, the arrow rest holds the shaft of the arrow relative to the arrow rest. In the ready position, the arrow rest supports the shaft of the arrow but no longer clamps the shaft of the arrow to allow the arrow to freely launch from the arrow rest.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Over the past few decades, the interest in the sport of archery in the United States has significantly increased. In particular, the number of sportsmen and sportswomen who hunt using a bow has continued to rise. As a result of this growth, the number of archery products manufacturers and the development of new archery products has greatly expanded.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">For many years, recurve bows were the only kind of bow available. Once the compound bow was introduced, the interest in and, naturally, the number of accessories for compound bows increased. Such accessories include various types of sighting apparatuses, stabilizing devices, vibration dampening device and arrow rests for supporting the shaft of the arrow when an arrow is drawn prior to launching. The first arrow rests typically comprised a V-shaped tab of plastic that was attached to the riser of the bow. With such devices, the shaft of the arrow rests within the V of the arrow rest while the archer aims the bow toward a target. It was discovered that the friction between the shaft of the arrow and the arrow rest and/or the contact between the arrow rest and the feathers or fletching on the aft end of the arrow can effect the trajectory and direction of flight of the arrow.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">To address this problem, many arrow rests are formed from a flexible material, such as plastic. By using a flexible material, the arrow rest can deflect out of the way when the arrow is launched from the bow. Such a plastic arrow rest, however, has its drawbacks. For example, the plastic tab arrow rest typically deflects in a direction transverse to the direction of flight of the arrow. As such, contact between the fletching of an arrow and the arrow rest can still effect the flight of the arrow.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">In order to provide a more stable support for an arrow and to allow the arrow rest to flex away from the shaft in the direction of the flight of the arrow, arrow rests have been developed that include a pair of arms. The tips of the arms support the shaft of the arrow. The arms are typically attached to or integrally formed with a rotatable shaft that is rotatably mounted to a mounting bracket. The mounting bracket is configured for attachment to the riser of a compound bow. In addition, the shaft is biased relative to the mounting bracket so that the arms are biased toward the shaft of an arrow when the arrow is resting upon the tips of the arms. The biasing of the arms is provided by a coil spring interposed between the mounting bracket and the rotatable shaft.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">When an arrow is launched from a bow utilizing such an arrow rest, the impact of the fletching of the arrow upon the arms of the arrow rest will cause the arms to rotate downwardly. After the fletching pass the arms, the coil spring then causes the arms to rotate back to their pre-launch position. This contact between the fletching and the arrow rest can effect the trajectory of the arrow by applying drag, and/or torque to the shaft of the arrow as the arrow is released.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Muzzy Products Corp. in Georgia has attempted to provide an arrow rest that eliminates the effects of the arrow rest on the flight of the arrow. In the Muzzy device, the arrow rest lifts the shaft of the arrow to a pre-shoot position at full draw and falls away as the arrow is released. The arrow rest rises from a resting position to a pre-launch position by being coupled between the riser and the cable slide. The arrow rest is coupled between the riser and the cable slide with a pair of arms that are pivotally connected to one another and to the riser and cable slide. As the bow is drawn to a pre-launch position sliding the cable guide along the cable guard away from the riser, the pair of arms straighten relative to one another. As the pair of arms straighten, the arrow rest rises relative to the riser. When the arrow is released, the action of the cable causes the cable guide to slide back to its resting position. The movement of the cable guide back to its original position causes the arrow rest to drop.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Another example of a “fall-away” arrow rest is manufactured by Trophy Taker of Montana. The arrow rest is coupled to the riser and tide with a tether to the cable of the bow. The arrow rest is actuated from a resting position to a pre-launch position at full draw by the pull on the tether generated by the cable. As tension is applied to the tether, the arrow rest is caused to be rotated from a first position to a second position that raises the shaft of the arrow. As the arrow is released, the tension on the tether is removed and the arrow rest is allowed to drop by rotation of the arrow rest relative to the riser. Such fall-away arrow rests, while attempting to resolve some of the problems caused by arrow rests, do not address a significant disadvantage of all arrow rests.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">When an archer draws an arrow along the arrow rest, one hand grasps the grip of the bow and the other draws the cable. The shaft of the arrow rests on the arrow rest but is otherwise unsupported along its length. As most arrow rests provide a V-shaped notch for supporting the shaft of the arrow or a pair of arms whose tips support the shaft therein between, any sudden movement of the bow can cause the shaft of the arrow to fall from the arrow rest. Often times, such the shaft of the arrow falls from the arrow rest when an archer has pulled the cable to a full draw, but decides to controllably return the cable to its resting position without launching the arrow. Because of the jerking force of such a maneuver, the archer is often unable to maintain the shaft of the arrow on the arrow rest. As the arrow falls, it may impact the riser of the bow generating a noise that can startle game.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In a hunting setting, noise is a major factor in the ability to stalk an animal. Hunters take great strides to maintain silence in the wild so as to not startle the game. As most hunters will attest, the “clanking” of the shaft of a falling arrow against the riser is sure to startle most game causing the animal to flee.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">The Muzzy device attempts to address this issue by providing a relatively large V for supporting the shaft of the arrow. Even with the Muzzy device, however, an archer is not likely to be able to move through underbrush with a loaded arrow without the arrow falling from the arrow rest.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">Another example of an arrow rest that prevents the shaft of the arrow from falling from the arrow rest is comprised of a cylindrical aperture supporting a plurality of inwardly extending bristles that form a small opening in the center of the bristles for supporting the shaft of the arrow. As the arrow is launched, the fletching can pass through the bristles. The bristles, however, tend to tear the fletching from the shaft of the arrow.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">Thus, it would be advantageous to provide an arrow rest that is capable of grasping the shaft of the arrow when the arrow is at a resting position and freely supporting the shaft of the arrow when the bow is at full draw. It would also be advantageous to provide such an arrow rest that falls away as the arrow is launched to eliminate effects of the arrow rest on the flight and/or fletching of the arrow.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0018">These and other advantages will become apparent from a reading of the following summary of the invention and description of the illustrated embodiments in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">Accordingly, an arrow rest comprises an arrow rest support arm pivotally mounted to the riser of a bow. The support arm is coupled to the cable guide of the bow through linkage that causes the support arm to rise relative to the riser of the bow as the cable is drawn to launch an arrow. As the cable is released to launch an arrow, the arrow rest drops to allow the fletching to pass the arrow rest without contact.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">As the arrow rest moves from a first resting position to a second pre-launch position and back again, the support arm is provided with a clamping mechanism that grasps the shaft of the arrow when the support arm is in the resting position. As the support arm moves to the pre-launch position, the clamping mechanism releases the shaft of the arrow so that the arrow can be freely launched from the support arm without interference from the clamping mechanism. As the cable is released and the cable guide returns to its resting position, the support arm also returns to its resting position. As the support arm moves from the pre-launch position to the resting position, the clamping mechanism closes relative to the support arm so as to be able to grasp the shaft of an arrow.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">The clamping mechanism is comprised of a flexible or rigid material that allows the shaft of an arrow to be inserted into the clamping mechanism while it is in a closed position. The clamping mechanism, however, prevents the shaft of the arrow from being dislodged from the clamping mechanism until the cable of the bow is drawn an amount sufficient to open the clamping mechanism.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">The clamping mechanism may be actuated by contacting the shelf of the riser or an overdraw shelf as a secondary shelf such that the clamping mechanism closes upon contacting the shelf. The clamping mechanism is biased into an open position so that as the clamping mechanism rises relative to the shelf of the riser, the clamping mechanism automatically opens.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">Likewise, the clamping mechanism may be actuated by gear-type arrangements that cause the clamping mechanism to open and close around the shaft.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">It is also contemplated that the shaft of the arrow may be removed from the clamping mechanism by a secondary arrow rest support that rises to remove the shaft of the arrow from the clamping mechanism as the cable is drawn.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0047">Referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a compound bow, generally indicated at <b>10</b>, to which an arrow rest assembly, generally indicated at <b>20</b> is, is attached. The compound bow comprises a typical bow assembly having a riser <b>12</b> and an upper limb <b>14</b> to which an upper pulley or cam is rotatably attached. A cable <b>18</b> is provided for launching an arrow (not shown). It should be noted, however, that while the bow <b>10</b> is illustrated as having a particular configuration, the arrow rest <b>20</b> of the present invention could be adapted to be attached to and function with any compound bow in the art as well as those developed in the future.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">The riser <b>12</b> of the bow <b>10</b> defines a laterally offset portion <b>22</b> through which the arrow is launched. The offset portion <b>22</b> allows the cable <b>18</b> to be in generally vertical alignment with the limb <b>14</b> and the remainder of the riser <b>12</b> while providing a channel or window to allow positioning of an arrow therein while maintaining proper alignment of the arrow relative to the cable <b>18</b> for launching. The arrow rest <b>20</b> is positioned within the offset portion <b>22</b> of the riser <b>12</b> so as to hold the arrow in proper alignment with the cable <b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The arrow rest <b>20</b> is comprised of a mounting bracket <b>24</b> mounted to the riser <b>12</b> of the bow <b>10</b>. A rotatable shaft <b>26</b> is coupled to the mounting bracket <b>24</b> and attached to a pivotable member <b>28</b>. The pivotable member <b>28</b> is linked to the cable guide (not visible) such that movement of the cable guide causes pivoting of the pivotable member <b>28</b> and corresponding rotation of the rotatable shaft <b>26</b>. The pivotable member <b>28</b> is biased relative to the mounting bracket <b>24</b> as with coil spring <b>30</b> attached to post <b>32</b>. An arrow rest support arm <b>34</b> is attached to the shaft <b>26</b> such that rotation of the shaft <b>26</b> causes the support arm <b>34</b> to pivot. The pivotable member <b>28</b> is biased in a direction that forces the support arm <b>34</b> toward the shelf <b>36</b> of the riser.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">The arrow rest <b>20</b> is provided with a clamping member <b>40</b> that is coupled to the support arm <b>34</b>. In the resting position as shown, the clamping member <b>40</b> extends over the support arm so as to clamp the shaft of an arrow relative to the support arm <b>34</b>. The clamping member <b>40</b> can rotate relative to the support arm <b>34</b> about its attachment point <b>42</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">As further illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the mounting bracket <b>24</b> extends behind the riser <b>12</b> and is fixedly attached thereto. The support arm <b>34</b> is pivotally coupled to the mounting bracket <b>24</b> with the rotatable shaft <b>26</b> that fits within the arm <b>35</b> and is rigidly held relative thereto with a set screw <b>43</b>. As the pivotable member <b>28</b> pivots relative to the mounting bracket rotating the rotatable shaft <b>26</b>, the arm <b>34</b> to rises off of the shelf <b>36</b> from a resting position as shown to a pre-launch position above the shelf <b>36</b>. The arm <b>34</b> is comprised of a first arm portion <b>44</b> that may be formed of a rigid material such as metal or a harder plastic and a second portion <b>46</b> that may be formed from a softer material such as rubber or a softer plastic. The first portion <b>44</b> provides structural support for the second portion and is capable of resisting damage from the forces encountered by the returning to or being present at the resting position.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The shaft of an arrow rests on the second portion <b>46</b>. Because the arm <b>34</b> returns to its resting position as the arrow is launched, it is not necessary to form the second portion <b>46</b> from a friction limiting material such as TEFLON or the like. That is, because the arrow does not slide to any substantial degree along the second portion <b>46</b> as the arrow is launched, it is not necessary to form the second portion <b>46</b> from a slick material as is commonly used on other types of arrow rests known in the art that maintain contact with the shaft of the arrow as the arrow is launched.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">The clamping member <b>40</b> forms part of a clamping mechanism for grasping the shaft of the arrow when the arrow rest is in the resting position. As the arm <b>34</b> is lifted, the clamping member <b>40</b> opens to release the shaft of the arrow. Whether launched or simply controllably returned to the resting position, the engagement of the clamping member <b>40</b> with the shelf <b>36</b>, or more particularly with a clamping member abutment structure <b>48</b>, causes the clamp to close relative to the second portion <b>46</b>. Because the clamping member <b>40</b> is formed from a flexible material such as a softer plastic or rubber material, the shaft of an arrow can be inserted between the clamping member <b>40</b> and the second portion <b>46</b> by slightly flexing open the clamping member <b>40</b> to allow passage of the shaft of an arrow therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">Actuation of the arrow rest <b>20</b> is controlled by coupling or linking the arrow rest <b>20</b> to the cable slide <b>50</b>. The cable slide <b>50</b> is commonly found on compound bows but is primarily used to position the cable spans <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> from lying in the same vertical plane as the primary cable portion <b>54</b> that is used to launch an arrow. That is, the cable spans <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> are moved to one side or offset from the vertical plane defined between the primary cable portion <b>54</b> and the arrow rest <b>20</b> so as to provide clearance for the shaft and fletching of an arrow. The cable slide <b>50</b> slides along a cable guide <b>56</b> that is rigidly secured relative to the riser <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">The cable guide <b>56</b> is comprised of an elongate shaft attached to the mounting bracket <b>24</b>. In a typical compound bow, the cable guide <b>56</b> is attached directly to the riser <b>12</b> at a position above the vertical location of the arrow rest relative to the riser. By moving it to the mounting bracket, the cable slide <b>50</b> is positioned in alignment with the arrow rest <b>20</b> for allowing a substantially horizontal linkage between the arrow rest and the cable slide <b>50</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">As the primary cable portion <b>54</b> is drawn, the cable slide <b>50</b> will move in the direction of the arrow <b>58</b> toward the proximal end <b>60</b> of the cable guide <b>56</b>. That is, as the cable portion <b>54</b> is pulled away from the riser <b>12</b>, the end of the limb <b>14</b> containing the pulley <b>16</b> will flex away from the riser <b>12</b> causing the cable spans <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> to also move away from the riser <b>12</b> so as to maintain their vertical orientation between the upper and lower pulleys or cams. By linking the pivotable member <b>28</b> to the cable slide <b>50</b> at a position spaced from its center of rotation, the movement of the slide <b>50</b> away from the riser will cause a corresponding rotation of the pivotable member <b>28</b>. Also, because there is tension between the pivotable member <b>28</b> in a direction toward the riser <b>12</b> a cable slide stop <b>62</b> is provided on the cable guide <b>56</b>. The cable stop <b>62</b> properly position the cable slide <b>50</b> relative to the cable guide <b>50</b> so as to maintain substantial vertical alignment of the cable spans <b>52</b> and <b>53</b>, that is without pulling the cable spans <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> toward the riser <b>12</b>, when the cable <b>18</b> is returned to a resting position as shown.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the pivotable member <b>28</b> is rotatably coupled to the mounting bracket <b>24</b> with the rotatable shaft <b>26</b>. The shaft <b>26</b> is fixedly held relative to the pivotable member <b>28</b> with a set screw <b>62</b> that spans a slot <b>64</b> defined by the pivotable member <b>28</b>. The shaft <b>26</b> can rotate relative to the mounting bracket <b>24</b> as by passing through a transversely extending bore through the mounting bracket <b>24</b> that may be lined with a plastic or other type of bushing or bearing surface to allow free rotation of the shaft <b>26</b> relative to the mounting bracket <b>24</b>. Of course, in a simpler version, the shaft could be integrally formed with the pivotable member by forming an L-shaped member with one leg of the L-shaped member rotatably coupled to the mounting bracket <b>24</b> and the other leg pivoted to rotate the first leg.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">The pivotable member <b>28</b> is linked to the cable slide <b>50</b> with a biasing member <b>66</b>. The cable slide <b>50</b> is provided with a pair of slots <b>63</b> and <b>65</b> for receiving and laterally engaging with the cable spans <b>52</b> and <b>53</b>. Thus, the cable slide <b>50</b> moves along the cable guide <b>56</b> as the cable spans <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> move away from the riser <b>12</b> as the cable is drawn. The biasing member is held relative to the pivotable member <b>28</b> and the cable slide <b>50</b> by engagement with a pair of posts <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> or threaded fasteners with an exposed portion for wrapping of the biasing member <b>66</b>. In this embodiment, the biasing member <b>66</b> is comprised of an elastic cord that allows for a certain amount of stretching of the cord before becoming taut. This amount of stretch provides a slight delay in the actuation of the pivotable member <b>28</b> relative to movement of the cable slide <b>50</b>. This allows for a small amount of pre-draw to be placed on the cable without causing actuation of the clamping mechanism of the arrow rest <b>20</b>. This also causes the clamping mechanism to return to its resting position before the cable returns to its resting position as the arrow is launched. That is, the arrow rest <b>20</b> returns to the resting position ahead of the cable to allow the arrow rest to move out of the way as the fletching of the arrow passes the arrow rest <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">A second biasing member <b>30</b> is coupled between the post <b>68</b> and a second post <b>72</b> or threaded fastener secured to the mounting bracket <b>24</b>. The second biasing member <b>30</b> is provided to cause the arm <b>34</b> to move to the resting position as shown when the cable slide <b>50</b> is also in the resting position. The second biasing member may be comprised of one or more coil springs that engage the posts <b>68</b> and <b>72</b> to create a bias between the mounting bracket <b>24</b> and the pivotable member <b>28</b>. The spring force of the second biasing member is configured to be greater than the spring force of the first biasing member <b>66</b> so as to pull the first biasing member <b>66</b> and the cable slide <b>50</b> toward the riser <b>14</b> as the cable is released when launching an arrow. As the cable slide <b>50</b>, however, returns to its resting position, the first biasing member <b>66</b> returns to its stretchable state while maintaining some amount of tension between the pivotable member <b>28</b> and the cable slide <b>50</b> without overpowering the second biasing member <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">The second biasing member <b>30</b> also provides an additional benefit to the ballistics of the bow itself. That is, the biasing force applied by the second biasing member <b>30</b> through the first biasing member when it is taut to the cable slide <b>50</b> increases the firing speed of the bow. Thus, the bow will actually shoot an arrow at a higher velocity with the arrow rest <b>20</b> of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the distal end of an clamping arrow rest, generally indicated at <b>100</b>, in accordance with the principles of the present invention shown in a first resting position (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) and a second pre-launch position (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) relative to the shelf <b>102</b> of the bow riser. The arrow rest <b>100</b> is comprised of a base portion <b>104</b> for supporting the shaft of an arrow (not shown) and a pivotable camping member <b>106</b> that is rotatably coupled to the base portion <b>104</b> and biased relative to the base portion <b>104</b> in a direction to encourage rotation of the clamping member <b>106</b> from its position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> to its position in FIG. <b>2</b>B.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The base portion defines a longitudinally extending slot <b>108</b> in the form of a V for supporting the shaft of an arrow. A projected portion <b>110</b> extends from the distal end <b>112</b> of the base portion <b>108</b> so as to provide an abutment surface <b>114</b> for engaging with a surface <b>118</b> of the clamping member <b>106</b> to prevent over rotation of the clamping member <b>106</b> relative to the base portion <b>104</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">The clamping member <b>106</b> is comprised of an arcuate clamping portion <b>120</b> a bulbous shaped abutment portion <b>122</b> and an attachment portion <b>124</b> having a bore extending there through for attachment to the base potion <b>104</b>. An abutment member <b>126</b> is attached to the shelf <b>102</b> for abutting the abutment portion <b>122</b> as the arrow rest <b>100</b> moves from its pre-launch position back to the resting position to cause the clamping member <b>106</b> to from an open position back to a closed/grasping position. As shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A. The rounded surface <b>128</b> of the clamping member <b>106</b> slides along the abutment member <b>126</b> as the arrow rest <b>100</b> drops. When the clamping member <b>106</b> is positioned relative to the abutment member <b>126</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the clamping member <b>106</b> is “locked” in place such that manual rotation of the clamping member <b>106</b> is prevented by the abutment member <b>126</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">By forming the clamping member <b>106</b> from a flexible material such as a rubber or plastic, the gap <b>130</b> between the clamping portion <b>120</b> ad the base <b>104</b> can be increased to allow manual insertion of removal of a shaft of an arrow without having to rotate the clamping member <b>106</b> relative to the base <b>104</b>. The clamping portion <b>120</b>, however, is rigid enough to hold the shaft of an arrow in the channel <b>108</b> and help prevent the arrow shaft from becoming inadvertently disengaged from the arrow rest <b>100</b>. Also, by facing the gap <b>130</b> toward the surface of the riser (FIG. <b>1</b>A), if the shaft of an arrow does become dislodged from the clamping member <b>106</b>, the arrow will likely fall between the arrow rest <b>100</b> and the riser without falling to the ground.</p>
  <p num="p-0065"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional side view of an arrow rest arm, generally indicated at <b>150</b> in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The arm <b>150</b> includes an elongate attachment member <b>152</b> defining an aperture <b>154</b> for receiving a shaft for rotation of the arm <b>150</b> relative thereto. The attachment member <b>152</b> is attached to an arrow supporting member <b>156</b> that is slid onto the distal end <b>158</b> of the arm <b>152</b>. The arrow supporting member <b>156</b> provides a longitudinally extending channel or slot <b>159</b> within which the shaft of an arrow can at least partially reside therein. A clamping member <b>162</b> is coupled to the supporting member <b>156</b> with a threaded fastener <b>164</b> that extends through the clamping member <b>162</b> and threadedly engages the arm <b>152</b>. A biasing member <b>166</b>, such as a coil spring, is positioned on the shaft of the threaded fastener <b>164</b> and biases the clamping member <b>162</b> relative to the supporting member <b>156</b>. to encourage clamping of the shaft of an arrow relative to the supporting member <b>156</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0066"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an arrow rest, generally indicated at <b>200</b> configured for clamping the shaft of an arrow (not shown) relative thereto and releasing the shaft of the arrow when the arrow is in a position to be launched. The actuation of the arrow rest <b>200</b> is provided by a mechanism configured similarly to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, that is by rotation of a shaft <b>202</b> to cause pivotal rotation of the arrow rest arm <b>204</b> relative thereto. In this embodiment, however, the arrow rest is provided with a clamping member <b>206</b> that is actuated by a rack <b>208</b> and pinion gear <b>210</b> that engages with gear teeth <b>212</b> provided on the clamping member <b>206</b>. The pinion gear <b>210</b> is an idle gear (i.e., freely rotatable) that is coupled to the arm <b>204</b> and moves therewith. The rack <b>208</b> is attached to the riser <b>214</b> and may be positioned at a slight angle to match the angular rotation of the pinion gear <b>210</b> as it pivots upwardly with the arm <b>204</b>. As the pinion gear <b>210</b> is lifted the pinion gear <b>210</b> will rotate relative to the rack <b>208</b> causing the clamping member <b>206</b> to open. As the pinion gear <b>210</b> moves down the rack <b>208</b>, the engagement with the teeth <b>212</b> on the clamping member <b>206</b> will cause the clamping member <b>206</b> to become closed as illustrated. Thus, both opening and closing of the clamping member <b>206</b> is actuated by the pinion gear <b>210</b>. Of course, those of skill in the art will appreciate after understanding the principles of the present invention that many other mechanisms may be employed to provide a clamping feature relative to the arrow rest for grasping the shaft of an arrow when the arrow is in a resting position. The present invention in intended to cover each and every variation of the present invention and equivalents thereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the clamping arrow rest, generally indicated at <b>300</b> is comprised of a pair of scissor type clamping members <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> that define a central aperture <b>306</b> therein between for receiving an holding the shaft of an arrow. As such, each clamping member <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> defines a crescent shaped recess <b>308</b> and <b>310</b>, respectively, for engaging the sides of the shaft of an arrow. The clamping members <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are biased relative to one other in a direction that encourages separation of the recesses <b>308</b> and <b>310</b>. In addition, the clamping member <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> can rotate relative to each other about a central shaft <b>312</b>. A biasing device <b>314</b>, such as a coil spring, is provide on the shaft <b>312</b> to bias the clamping members <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> into an open position. The clamping member <b>302</b> is provided with a recess <b>316</b> that defines and abutment surface <b>318</b> for abutting against the arcuate surface <b>320</b> of the clamping member <b>304</b>. When the surface <b>320</b> is engaged against the surface <b>318</b>, the clamping members <b>302</b> and <b>404</b> are in an open position. The surface <b>322</b> and <b>324</b> then define a V-shaped notch for supporting the shaft of an arrow.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">As the arrow rest returns to a resting position in which the legs of the clamping members <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> engage the shelf <b>326</b> of the riser <b>328</b>, the curved surfaces of the legs, such as surface <b>320</b>, slide along the shelf <b>326</b> until the bases of the surface <b>322</b> and <b>324</b> abut to hold the clamping members slightly apart as shown.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, an arrow rest, generally indicated at <b>400</b>, is caused to pivot as indicated by arrows <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> about a rotatable shaft <b>404</b>. An arrow rest arm <b>406</b> is attached to the shaft <b>404</b>. The arm <b>406</b> extends on both sides of the shaft <b>404</b>. A shaft support <b>408</b> is attached to the distal end <b>410</b> of the arm <b>406</b> and defines a channel <b>412</b> for supporting the shaft <b>414</b> of an arrow <b>416</b>. A clamping device <b>420</b> is attached to the proximal end <b>422</b> of the arm <b>406</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the clamping device <b>420</b> is a C shaped member when turned on its side to define a partially enclosed central aperture <b>424</b> for receiving the shaft <b>414</b> of an arrow <b>416</b>. The base <b>426</b> of the device <b>420</b> is provided with a pair of bores <b>428</b> and <b>430</b> for receiving threaded fasteners to attach the device <b>420</b> to the distal end <b>422</b> of the arm <b>406</b>. A similar means of attachment may be employed for attaching the shaft support <b>408</b> to the proximal end <b>410</b>. A pair of crescent shaped arms portions <b>432</b> and <b>434</b> further define the aperture <b>424</b> and are spaced apart at their tips to allow insertion and removal of the shaft <b>414</b> of the arrow <b>416</b> while securing the shaft <b>414</b> in the aperture <b>424</b> to prevent the shaft <b>414</b> from simply falling out if the device <b>420</b> becomes inverted. The device <b>420</b> is formed from a soft flexible material such as rubber, foam rubber or foam.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">As the arrow rest arm <b>406</b> rotates in the direction of arrows <b>401</b> and <b>402</b>, the shaft support <b>408</b> will lift the shaft <b>414</b> relative the to the shelf <b>438</b> of the riser. As the shaft <b>414</b> is lifted and the clamping device <b>420</b> lowers, the shaft <b>414</b> will be pulled from engagement with clamping device <b>420</b> to be free to be launched. When the arrow <b>416</b> is released, the arm <b>406</b> is biased to return the support <b>408</b> to engage the shelf <b>438</b> as shown. The rotation of the arm <b>406</b>, however, is timed so as to allow the fletching (not shown) of the arrow <b>416</b> to pass by the clamping device <b>420</b> before the clamping device <b>420</b> moves back to a position where it may impact the fletching as it passes the clamping device <b>420</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">Finally, as shown in FIG. <b>7</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the arrow rest (as previously described) may be coupled to a cable slide with various linkage devices that provide some delay in actuation of the arrow rest relative to movement of the cable slide as an arrow is drawn. As previously discussed, such delay, while not essential, allows the arrow rest to move out of the way of the arrow before the fletching of the arrow passes the arrow rest. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the cable slide <b>500</b> is provided with a mounting portion <b>502</b> that defines a transversely extending bore <b>504</b>. A cable <b>506</b> (which is coupled to the arrow rest) is secured with a cable stop <b>508</b> that is crimped to the end of the cable <b>506</b>. The stop <b>508</b> is inserted into a coupling device <b>510</b> that defines a recess for holding the stop <b>508</b> therein and a threaded bore on the other end for receiving a threaded fastener <b>512</b>. The fastener <b>512</b> is provided with a coil spring <b>514</b> that biases the head of the fastener <b>512</b> relative to the mounting portion <b>502</b>. The fastener <b>512</b> extends through the bore <b>504</b> and into the coupler <b>510</b>. As the cable slide <b>500</b> slides along the cable guide <b>516</b> in the direction of the arrow, the spring <b>514</b> will be compressed to some degree before the cable <b>506</b> is moved, thus providing the aforementioned delay.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">Similarly, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a cable slide <b>600</b> is coupled to a cable <b>602</b> with a linkage mechanism <b>604</b> that includes a threaded fastener <b>606</b> inserted through a mounting portion <b>608</b> of the cable slide <b>600</b> and engages an internally threaded tube-like member <b>610</b>. The distal end <b>612</b> of the tube <b>610</b> is inwardly turned to provide an abutment surface for holding a spring <b>614</b> disposed around a threaded shaft <b>616</b>. A nut <b>618</b> is threaded onto the proximal end of the shaft <b>616</b> and can be adjusted to any point along the shaft to allow for adjustability of the linkage mechanism <b>604</b> for the particular bow configuration. The shaft <b>616</b> is threaded into a coupler <b>620</b> having a similar configuration to the coupler <b>510</b> shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. As the cable slide <b>600</b> moves to apply tension in the cable <b>602</b>, the spring <b>614</b> allows for movement of the slide <b>600</b> and the tube <b>610</b> before the cable <b>602</b> is moved along with movement of the cable slide <b>600</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a self-clamping arrow rest, generally indicated at <b>700</b>, in accordance with the present invention. The arrow rest <b>700</b> is comprised of a mounting bracket <b>702</b> for mounting the arrow rest <b>700</b> relative to the riser of a bow (not shown). A cable guide <b>704</b> is attached to the bracket <b>702</b>. A cable slide <b>706</b> for receiving the tuning cables of a compound bow is positioned on and slidable relative to the cable guide. The cable slide <b>706</b> is coupled to an adjustable linkage member <b>708</b> that is comprised of first and second components <b>710</b> and <b>712</b> that can be pinned or otherwise fastened together at discrete points to allow for adjustment of the length of the linkage member <b>708</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">The linkage member <b>708</b> is also coupled at its opposite end to a pivotable member <b>714</b> that is rotatably coupled to the bracket <b>702</b> by an elongate shaft <b>716</b> that extends through the bracket <b>702</b> and is rotatable relative thereto. On the other side of the bracket <b>702</b> from the pivotable member <b>714</b>, an arrow rest arm <b>718</b> is attached to the shaft <b>716</b>. The arrow rest arm <b>718</b> includes a clamping/shaft support assembly <b>720</b> that is configured to grasp the shaft of an arrow when the arm <b>718</b> is in a resting position and to release the shaft of the arrow when the arm <b>718</b> is raised. A biasing member <b>722</b> in the form of a coil spring is interposed and connected between the mounting bracket <b>702</b> and the pivotable member <b>714</b> so as to encourage rotation of the shaft <b>716</b> in a counter-clockwise direction and thus downward biasing of the support assembly <b>720</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">The pivotable member <b>714</b> is provided with an arm portion <b>724</b> having a plurality of attachment points thereon in the form of holes for allowing selective attachment at discrete points of the linkage member <b>708</b> relative thereto. A rubber stop <b>726</b> is positioned on the cable guide <b>704</b> to allow the cable slide <b>706</b> to abut there against when the tuning cables are in a resting position.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">As further illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the first and second components <b>710</b> and <b>712</b> of the linkage member <b>708</b> are provided with a plurality of holes, such as holes <b>728</b> and <b>730</b>, to allow for selective attachment of the two components as with fasteners <b>732</b> and <b>734</b>. The distal end <b>736</b> of the linkage member <b>708</b> fits within the cable slide <b>706</b>, and as will be described further, provides a delay as the linkage member <b>708</b> can move or slide as indicated by the arrow relative to the cable slide <b>706</b> a certain distance within the slot or channel <b>756</b> without causing corresponding movement of the cable slide <b>706</b> until it abuts the end <b>760</b> of the channel <b>756</b>. At that point, the cable slide <b>706</b> will move with the linkage member <b>708</b>. In a resting position, the linkage member <b>708</b> with be positioned within the channel <b>756</b> away from the end <b>760</b>. As the cable of the bow is drawn, the cable slide <b>706</b> can move away from the linkage member <b>708</b> a distance to cause a delayed reaction in movement between the cable slide <b>706</b> and the linkage member <b>708</b> until the end <b>736</b> of the linkage member <b>708</b> abuts the end <b>760</b> of the channel <b>756</b>. This provides the proper timing for bow stroke.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">As further illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the cable slide is comprised of a cable retention portion <b>740</b> integrally formed with a linkage maintaining portion <b>742</b>. The cable retention portion <b>740</b> is provided with two channels <b>744</b> and <b>746</b> for retaining and holding the tuning cables relative thereto. Each channel <b>744</b> and <b>746</b> has an L shape so as to help maintain the tuning cables therein. A transversely extending bore <b>748</b> is provided for receiving the cable guide <b>704</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">The linkage maintaining portion <b>742</b> is defined by a pair of side walls <b>750</b> and <b>752</b> held relative to one another by a connecting portion <b>754</b>. The side walls <b>750</b> and <b>752</b> define opposing channels <b>756</b> and <b>758</b>, respectively. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the channel <b>756</b> extends partially along the side wall <b>750</b> so as to terminate therein to define an abutment end <b>760</b>. A rubber stopper <b>762</b> is positioned on the opposite end of the abutment end <b>760</b> so as to retain the end of the linkage member <b>708</b> therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, one component <b>710</b> of the linkage member <b>708</b> is comprised of an elongate member having a cylindrical end portion <b>764</b> that extends laterally outwardly from the component <b>710</b>. The end portion <b>764</b> includes a pair of cylindrical protrusions <b>765</b> and <b>767</b> laterally extending therefrom configured for being slidably received within the channels <b>756</b> and <b>758</b>. Moreover, the spacing between the side walls <b>750</b> and <b>752</b> is such that the cylindrical portion protrusions <b>765</b> and <b>767</b> are held therein when inserted. Because of the length of the channels <b>756</b> and <b>758</b> relative to the diameter of the portions <b>765</b> and <b>767</b>, the portions <b>765</b> and <b>767</b> can slide a distance along the channels <b>756</b> and <b>758</b> to allow movement of the cable slide <b>706</b> relative to the component <b>710</b> before the portion <b>764</b> engages with the end <b>760</b> such that further movement of the cable slide <b>706</b> will cause corresponding movement of the linkage <b>708</b>. Such delay in movement of the linkage <b>708</b> relative to the cable slide <b>706</b> requires a certain amount of draw on the cable of the bow before the arm <b>718</b> raises and the clamping assembly releases the shaft of the arrow. Furthermore, at release of the arrow, the delay allows the arrow to become airborne before dropping away to allow the fletching or vanes of the arrow pass the arrow rest without contacting the clamping/support assembly <b>720</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">While the apparatus of the present invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments to illustrate what is believed to be the best mode of the invention, it is contemplated that upon review of the present invention, those of skill in the art will appreciate that various modifications and combinations may be made to the present embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as recited in the claims. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> the arrow rest could be linked to one of the cable spans without using the cable slide by attaching the linkage mechanism <b>802</b> directly to the cable <b>800</b>. Thus, a bracket or clamping device <b>804</b> fastened around the cable <b>800</b> could be attached directly to the cable <b>800</b> with the linkage mechanism <b>802</b> attached to the bracket or clamping device <b>804</b>. Thus, the cable guide need not be attached to the mounting bracket and the arrow rest of the present invention can work independently of the cable guide and/or cable slide. In another example as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, the clamping mechanism <b>900</b> of the arrow rest according to the principles of the present invention is comprised of a single piece member <b>902</b> formed from a flexible material, such as rubber or plastic. The member <b>902</b> defines an shaft grasping recess <b>904</b> for grasping the shaft <b>906</b> of an arrow when the member <b>902</b> is in contact with the riser shelf <b>908</b> or other abutment of a bow. The member includes a pair of legs <b>910</b> and <b>912</b> separated by a thinned portion <b>914</b> that functions essentially as a hinge between the two leg portions <b>910</b> and <b>912</b>. As the member <b>902</b> is lifted from the shelf <b>908</b>, the leg portions <b>910</b> and <b>912</b> are drawn together by the natural biasing force of the material from which the member <b>902</b> is formed. That is, the member <b>902</b> is formed to be shaped as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>B and is forced into its shape shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> by contact with the shelf <b>908</b>. Thus, as the bottoms of the leg portions <b>910</b> and <b>912</b> contact the shelf <b>908</b>, the legs are caused to spread apart which in turn causes the recess <b>904</b> to close around the shaft <b>906</b>. The bottoms of the leg portions <b>910</b> and <b>912</b> are rounded to encourage the legs to spread when contacting the shelf <b>908</b>. The opening of the top of the recess <b>904</b> is such that the shaft <b>906</b> can be inserted into the recess <b>904</b> when the arrow rest <b>900</b> is in the position shown in FIG. <b>16</b>A. Once inserted into the recess <b>904</b>, the shaft <b>906</b> is held within the recess <b>904</b> by the top edges of the recess <b>904</b>. With some effort, however, the shaft <b>906</b> can be removed from the recess <b>904</b> if desired. As the member <b>902</b> moves from the position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> to the position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, the arrow member opens the recess <b>904</b> to cradle the shaft <b>906</b> without obstructing its ability to be launched by the bow from the arrow rest <b>900</b>. The claims provided herein are intended to cover such modifications and combinations and all equivalents thereof. Reference herein to specific details of the illustrated embodiments is by way of example and not by way of limitation.</p>
