The lift truck is also equipped with a scanner for scanning coded identifying information associated with each piece of freight. As each piece of freight is handled by the lift truck, the coded identifying information for that piece of freight is captured along with the weight of the load. This information is transmitted to a computer system where it can be used for real-time invoicing. The system can also use the captured information to perform additional automated functions, such as tracking of shipments, freight loss control, and assisting in avoiding overloaded trucks. The same system can monitor maintenance information for the lift trucks so as to provide timely preventive maintenance, and can also provide the human resources information, such as the lift truck driver identification and amount of time worked.</div>

    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is related to and claims priority from U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/376,248 filed Apr. 29, 2002.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention relates to a system and method that is useful in the freight shipment industry.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Typically, in the freight shipment industry, shipments of freight are received from a shipper by the freight carrier, accumulated at freight terminals where they are sorted by shipment destination and then loaded onto tractor-trailer trucks for shipment. At a receiving terminal, the shipments of freight are unloaded, and sorted for trans-shipment or delivery. Usually, the freight shipment is arranged on one or more pallets, and the loading and unloading is handled by lift trucks. Each shipment of freight is assigned an identifying number, and this number is used for tracking the freight from its origin to its destination.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Shipping charges are based upon the weight and the classification of the freight shipment and its weight. Typically, the weight of the shipment is provided to the freight carrier by the shipper on a bill of lading, and the shipment charges are calculated based upon the stated weight provided by the shipper. The freight carrier may conduct spot checks by reweighing selected shipments, but in most instances, the stated weight provided by the shipper is used as the basis for the freight charge, since it has not been feasible to reweigh each piece of freight handled by the freight carrier.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">The present invention is based upon the recognition that in many instances, the shipment weight provided by the shipper is understated, which can result in a significant loss of revenue to the freight carrier. The present invention provides a system and method that makes it possible to achieve real-time weighing of each freight shipment, and real-time invoicing based upon the actual weight of the shipment. The real-time invoicing provides enhanced timeliness and labor savings, and the ability to capture the actual weight of each freight shipment makes it possible to recover significant revenue that would otherwise be lost due to understated shipment weights provided by the shipper.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">According to the present invention, the lift trucks used by the freight carrier for handling and loading freight shipments are equipped with a weighing device capable of weighing each piece of freight handled by the lift truck. The lift truck is also equipped with a scanner for scanning coded identifying information associated with each piece of freight. As each piece of freight is handled by the lift truck, the coded identifying information for that piece of freight is captured along with the weight of the load. This information is transmitted to a computer system where it can be used for real-time invoicing. The system of the present invention can also use the captured information to perform additional automated functions, such as tracking of shipments, freight loss control, and assisting in avoiding overloaded trucks. The same system can monitor maintenance information for the lift trucks so as to provide timely preventive maintenance, and can also provide the human resources information, such as the lift truck driver identification and amount of time worked.</p>
    <description-of-drawings> <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading> <p num="p-0008">Some of the features and advantages of the invention having been described, others will become apparent from the detailed description which follows, and from the accompanying drawings, in which:</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT</heading> <p num="p-0012">The present inventions now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, these inventions may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
    <p num="p-0013"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic illustration of the system and method for weighing and tracking freight in accordance with the present invention. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> two freight terminals are shown, a first freight terminal <b>11</b>, which may be located in one city, and a second freight terminal <b>12</b>, which may be located in a distant city. While only two freight terminals are shown for simplicity, it will be understood that a typical freight distribution system will include many freight terminals at various different cities. The freight distribution system also includes a central office, indicated at <b>14</b>, where certain business operations of the freight carrier are performed.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">At each freight terminal a number of trailers <b>15</b> are arranged at a loading dock for receiving or unloading freight F. The freight is handled by lift trucks <b>16</b>. In the embodiment shown, the lift trucks are conventional forklifts which are equipped with a weighing device that is capable of obtaining the weight of each piece of freight handled by the forklift. The weighing device may comprise a load cell mounted to one of the forks of the forklift. Suitable load cells is for this purpose are commercially available from various sources. The load cell is capable of determining the weight of a piece of freight when the lift truck lifts the piece of freight from the ground. The load cell is of such accuracy that it can function as a “legal for trade” weighing device.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">Each lift truck is also equipped with a scanner that the operator of the lift truck can use for scanning coded identifying information associated with a piece of freight. The scanner can be a conventional commercially available bar code scanner. The scanner will read coded identifying information in the form of a bar code when the scanner is pointed at the bar code and activated, such as pressing a switch or pulling a trigger. In the embodiment shown, each lift truck is also equipped with a remote computer <b>17</b> and with a wireless transmitter (not shown), which may be incorporated into the housing of the computer <b>17</b>, and which is connected to an antenna <b>44</b>. The remote computer <b>17</b> receives weight information for a piece of freight from the weighing device and the coded identification information for that piece of freight from the scanner. This information is then transmitted by the transmitter to a receiver <b>20</b> associated with a base computer <b>21</b> located in the freight terminal. Each base computer <b>21</b> is connected via a suitable communications network <b>22</b> to a central computer <b>30</b> located at the central office <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0016"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one way in which the lift truck can be equipped for implementing the system and method of the present invention. In this embodiment, the remote computer <b>17</b> is mounted to the lift truck adjacent to the operator's seat. The computer <b>17</b> is equipped with a display device <b>41</b>, such as a LCD display, conveniently located for displaying information to the operator of the lift truck. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the display device is mounted to the roof cage of the lift truck directly in front of the lift truck driver. The display device <b>41</b> can also function as an input device for receiving commands from the lift truck operator. For example, the display device <b>41</b> can be a touch-screen device, or it can be equipped with suitable keys or buttons, such as “soft keys” that have changeable identification labels that are shown on the display device. A handheld bar code scanner <b>42</b> is connected to the computer <b>17</b> and is positioned so as to be readily accessible to the lift truck operator. A load cell <b>43</b> mounted on the fork of the lift truck is also communicatively connected to the computer <b>17</b> by wires (not shown). An antenna <b>44</b> is mounted to the roof of the lift truck and is connected to the transmitter, which is housed with the computer <b>17</b>. It should be understood that this illustrated embodiment represents only one of many ways that the system and method of the present invention can be implemented. For example, in one alternative embodiment, the computer, display device, input device, transmitter, antenna, and scanner are integrated into a single handheld unit, and information from the load cell can be communicated to this handheld unit either by cable or by a wireless connection, such as a Bluetooth link. Alternatively, instead of transmitting information from the computer <b>17</b> to the base computer <b>20</b> by a wireless connection, the information can simply be stored in a data storage device of the remote computer <b>17</b> and periodically downloaded to the base computer <b>21</b> by a physical connection, such as a cable or docking cradle.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">The coded identifying information for a piece of freight can either be affixed directly to the piece of freight, or it can be provided on a document that is associated with the piece of freight. If it is affixed to the piece of freight, the lift truck operator will simply aim the scanner at a bar code on the piece of freight to read the coded information. It is conventional in the freight shipment industry to create a movement document that follows the freight shipment from its origin to its destination. This movement document includes the identification of the shipper, the consignee name and address, the number of pieces in the shipment, and a description of the shipment. It also has a unique freight bill number (often referred to in the industry as a “pro number”) for that shipment, and a corresponding bar code. If the movement document is used as the source of identifying information for the piece of freight, the lift truck operator will simply use the scanner to scan the identifying information from the bar code on the movement document.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">When a shipment of freight is received from a shipper, the system and method of the present invention is used to capture the actual weight of each piece of freight in the shipment. For example, as each piece of freight is handled by the lift truck at the origin terminal, the lift truck operator scans the identifying information for that piece of freight and the weight of the piece of freight is determined by the weighing device. This information is transmitted to the base computer <b>21</b> and stored. The information can also be made available to the central computer <b>30</b> in the central office <b>14</b>. In one specific embodiment of the present invention, this information is captured by the driver of the lift truck in a simple “lift-shoot-shoot” sequence. First the driver lifts the piece of freight so that the load cell can obtain the weight of the piece of freight. Then the driver “shoots” the coded identifying information for that piece of freight by aiming the barcode scanner at the bar code provided on the movement document for that piece of freight. Finally, the driver “shoots” another predetermined barcode in order to signify to the system that the weighing and reading sequence has been completed. This other predetermined barcode can be located at any suitable location on the lift truck, such as, for example, on the display device located in front of the lift truck driver. The reading of this barcode functions as a signal to the system to close the file and to transmit the information to the base computer <b>21</b>. Each transmission to the base computer includes the following information: coded identifying information read from the movement document, total freight weight read by the load cell, forklift number, forklift operator identification, date and time, and location of the freight terminal where the information was obtained.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">When the freight shipment is unloaded at the destination terminal, a similar “lift-shoot-shoot” procedure is followed to capture the identifying information and actual weight of each piece of freight handled at the terminal. By comparing the actual weight of a shipment at the origin terminal to the weight of the shipment at the destination terminal, a loss control module can rapidly determine whether the shipment arrived intact, or whether there was any loss or pilfering. This information can also be utilized by a tracking module to provide information on the status and location of the shipment.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">The system can also include a loading module to facilitate loading a trailer with freight. The loading module includes means for receiving information identifying the trailer into which the lift truck loads the piece of freight, and means for associating this trailer identifying information with a maximum load limit for that trailer. Each time a lift truck delivers a piece of freight to that trailer, the accumulated load weight for that trailer is determined by adding the weight of that piece of freight to the weight of all previously loaded pieces of freight. When the accumulated load weight reaches a predetermined level, in relation to the maximum load limit, a signal is generated that can be used to display information to the operator of the lift truck concerning the progress of loading, or alert the operator that the maximum load limit has been reached. The information identifying the trailer into which the piece of freight is loaded can be received in any of several ways. For example, the lift truck operator can use the scanner to scan a trailer identifying bar code located at the entrance to the trailer where the piece of freight is to be loaded. Alternatively, the trailer identification may be preassigned to a piece of freight and indicated on the movement document to inform the lift truck operator where to load the piece of freight. In this case, the scanning of the movement document will serve not only to identify the piece of freight, but also the trailer into which the piece of freight is to be loaded. Alternatively, the trailer identification can be entered manually by the operator of the lift truck using the input device associated with the computer <b>17</b>, such as a touch screen, keyboard or pen.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">The system can further include a maintenance module to assist in monitoring maintenance of the lift trucks. The remote computer <b>17</b> on each lift truck can receive status information from the lift truck such as, for example, the number of hours of operation, or any status messages generated by sensors on the lift truck or by a engine control computer module for the lift truck. This information can be used by the central computer <b>30</b> for scheduling routine preventive maintenance of the lift trucks or for dispatching a service call.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">The system can also include a human resources module for collecting and monitoring information for use by the human resources department of the freight carrier. The human resources module may, for example, require the lift truck operator to log in each time he begins operating the lift truck. In this way, the system can track information about which driver handled each piece of freight in a shipment, driver operating time on the lift truck, number of freight pieces handled, or other information. The collected information can be transmitted to the central computer for use in generating payroll information, work assignments, or for historical purposes.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">The system can also include a customer service module which will allow customer service representatives to view the real-time data about freight shipments and to thus provide customers with status and location information about shipments. The customer service representatives can be located at a call center <b>48</b> and may access the information via the communications network <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">The system and method of the present invention is designed to be integrated into the existing freight tracking and invoicing infrastructure of a freight carrier, and supplements the carrier's existing computerized invoicing software. The following description of a typical freight carrier's freight tracking and invoicing functions should provide contextual understanding of how the present invention is implemented and used.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">A freight shipment cycle begins when a call from a shipper requesting a freight pickup is received by the freight carrier. The freight carrier will assign a shipment number (pro number) to this shipment, and will instruct a truck driver to pick up the shipment. Typically, the following minimum information is obtained: consignee name and address, stated weight of the shipment and payment information. This information may be provided by telephone, or more typically on a bill of lading prepared by the shipper and given to the truck driver for the freight carrier. Upon receipt of this information, the freight carrier assigns a shipment number (pro number) for this particular shipment. The shipment number may, for example, be attached as a sticker to the bill of lading furnished by the shipper, in which case this bill of lading will function as the movement document. The shipment number may also be represented by a computer readable bar code. Typically, the truck driver will add information to the movement document, such as number of pieces (shipping units) and a description of the shipment, if not already provided.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">Upon returning to the freight terminal with the shipments, a data entry clerk updates the freight carrier's computer system with information about the collected shipments, including the information, if any, manually added by the driver, such as number of pieces in the shipment. A further movement document may be generated with this updated information, to be used either in addition to (e.g. stapled to the original bill of lading) or in lieu of the bill of lading furnished by the shipper. The movement document will follow the shipment until its destination.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">At this point, the freight carrier's accounting system has all the information needed to generate an invoice for the shipment. The conventional system will generate an invoice at a suitable time using, as a basis for the shipping charges, the stated weight provided by the shipper. The present invention integrates with the existing accounting and invoicing system and provides the capability to update the data record for each shipment or pro number with a real-time actual weight for the shipment. The invoicing module in the central computer uses the thus-captured identifying information and real-time actual weight data to generate customer invoices. The invoices are based upon the actual weight for each piece of freight shipped, rather than an estimate of the shipment weight. The freight carrier's standard accounting software can utilize the information to generate the customer invoices using customer information stored in a database.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">Information maintained by the system of the present invention can be made available to authorized users through conventional hard-wired networks, wireless networks, virtual private networks, through web access, or other suitable networking methods.</p>
    <p num="p-0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one possible configuration for the software modules that facilitate implementation of the system and method of the present invention. It will be understood by those familiar with computer software that various other implementations are possible and within the scope of the present invention. In this embodiment, software modules are resident in the remote computer <b>17</b> that is located on the lift truck, in the base computer <b>21</b> at the freight terminal, and in the central computer <b>30</b> at the central business office of the freight carrier. These modules process, receive and share information as needed to carry out their assigned tasks or functions.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">In the remote computer <b>17</b>, a log on module <b>51</b> captures the lift truck operator identification at the beginning of a shift, as well as the time and date of log in and log out. It additionally may capture the number of lifts made by the operator. The data capture and transmission module <b>52</b> captures the identifying information for a shipment from the scanner and the weight of the shipment from the load cell, and controls transmission of this information to the base computer <b>21</b>. The maintenance module <b>53</b> maintains pertinent maintenance information such as total running time, number of lifts, etc. and passes this information to the base computer <b>21</b>. The human resources module <b>54</b> coordinates sending pertinent information about the lift truck operator to the base computer <b>21</b>, such as the log in and log out times and dates. The loading module <b>55</b> facilitates receiving information about which trailer a shipment is loaded into, and displaying information to the lift truck operator about the status of loading that trailer, such as cumulative weight loaded onto the trailer or whether the maximum weight limit for that trailer is being approached or has been exceeded.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">At the base computer <b>21</b>, a configuration module <b>61</b> controls the basic configuration and “housekeeping” functions of system. A data capture module <b>62</b> receives and stores the data transmitted from the lift trucks <b>16</b> in the terminal. A data entry and update module <b>63</b> allows for entry and updating of information by a data entry clerk. A maintenance module <b>64</b> receives and administers the maintenance information from the maintenance modules <b>53</b> of the respective lift trucks. Likewise, the human resources module <b>65</b> receives and administers human resources information from the human resource modules <b>54</b> of the respective lift trucks. A loading module <b>66</b> interfaces with the loading modules <b>55</b> on the respective lift trucks.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">At the central computer <b>30</b>, a configuration module <b>71</b> controls the basic configuration and “housekeeping” functions of the system. A tracking module <b>72</b> utilizes the time and date stamp data and location data that is generated by a lift truck each time a shipment is handled to trace the progress of the shipment and its current location. An invoicing module <b>73</b> makes available to the freight carrier's standard invoicing software, the actual weight of each shipment. A loss control module <b>74</b> compares the actual weight of a shipment at one location (e.g. its origin) with the actual weight of the same shipment at another location (e.g. its destination) to identify if there is any variance. A customer support module <b>75</b> gives a customer support representative access to pertinent information, such as tracking information, invoicing information, etc. A human resources module <b>76</b> coordinates the information obtained by the human resource modules <b>54</b> and <b>65</b>, and a maintenance module <b>77</b> coordinates the information from the maintenance modules <b>53</b>, <b>64</b>. A management reports module <b>78</b> has access to all of the accumulated data obtained by the system and is capable of displaying or printing various kinds of management information. A web access module <b>79</b> provides for uploading selected subsets of the data stored on the central computer to a web host to allow for remote web access by authorized users. The various functions such as customer support, human resources and maintenance may, if desired, be accessed remotely via web access rather than through a direct network connection.</p>
