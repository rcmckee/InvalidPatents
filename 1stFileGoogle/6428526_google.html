    <p>This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/791,691 entitled “PROCESS OF PROVIDING MECHANICAL FASTENERS ON DISPOSABLE ABSORBENT ARTICLES” and filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Jan. 30, 1997 now abandoned, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/335,527, filed Nov. 7, 1994, now abandoned. The entirety of this application is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The use of mechanical fastening means on disposable absorbent articles, such as diapers, training pants, adult incontinent products, feminine care products, and the like, are well known. A common type of mechanical fastener employed on disposable absorbent articles is a hook-and-loop type fastener in which a hook or hook-like element is provided which is adapted for releasably engaging with a loop or loop-like material. Such hook-and-loop type fasteners are also well known in the prior art. Other well known types of mechanical fasteners include snaps, buttons, zippers, mushroom fasteners and the like.</p>
    <p>While the use of mechanical fasteners, such as hook-and-loop type fasteners, on disposable absorbent articles is known, such use has not become widespread. This is due, in part, to the increased cost of such mechanical fasteners relative to the more common adhesive tapes currently used on disposable absorbent articles. An additional reason that mechanical fasteners have not been widely used on disposable absorbent articles relates to the difficulty of forming and controlling such fasteners at the high speeds generally associated with the manufacture of disposable absorbent articles. The process issues associated with the formation of such mechanical fasteners also affects the relative cost of such fasteners.</p>
    <p>The process difficulties associated with the mechanical fasteners relates not only to the formation and attachment of the mechanical fasteners to other elements of the disposable absorbent articles but also to the control and protection of the mechanical fasteners as the absorbent article is manufactured and packaged. This is particularly true when trying to form and control hook-and-loop type fasteners. For example, the hook material must be controlled and protected to reduce or eliminate damage to the hook material during the manufacturing and packaging processes. Thus, in order to render the use of mechanical fasteners, such as hook-and-loop type fasteners, on disposable absorbent articles more feasible, it is desirable to provide improved processes for the control and protection of such fasteners.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In response to the discussed difficulties and problems encountered in the prior art, a new process for attaching and protecting mechanical fasteners on disposable absorbent articles and a disposable absorbent article produced by the same has been discovered.</p>
    <p>In one aspect, the present invention concerns a process for attaching a mechanical fastener to a disposable absorbent article and protecting said mechanical fastener before said disposable absorbent article is handled by a user. The process comprises the following steps: (1) providing a disposable absorbent article which includes an outer cover, a bodyside liner, and an absorbent core disposed between the outer cover and the bodyside liner; (2) providing a mechanical fastener which includes a first fastening element; (3) attaching the first fastening element of the mechanical fastener to the disposable absorbent article; (4) releasably engaging the first fastening element with the disposable absorbent article to protect the first fastening element; and (5) subsequently packaging the disposable absorbent article for commercial sale. In a particular aspect of the invention, the first fastening element and a portion of the disposable absorbent article are releasably engaged by passing them between a pair of rotatable nip rolls.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to a process for attaching and protecting a mechanical fastener on a disposable absorbent article and a disposable absorbent article produced by the same. The term “disposable absorbent article” is intended to refer to any disposable article intended to absorb discharged body fluids. Examples of disposable absorbent articles include diapers, adult incontinence products, training pants, feminine napkins, wound dressings, and the like. For ease of understanding, much of the following description of the present invention will be made in terms of the process of attaching and protecting mechanical fasteners on disposable diapers and the disposable diapers made by such processes. Nonetheless, it is to be understood that the process of attaching and protecting mechanical fasteners of the present invention is equally suited for use in manufacturing any other disposable absorbent article.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the present invention refers to a process for attaching and protecting mechanical fasteners on disposable absorbent articles. For example, the process may be used to attach mechanical fasteners to a disposable diaper such as that representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-8. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the disposable diaper <b>20</b> generally comprises an outer cover <b>22</b>, an inner bodyside liner <b>24</b>, and an absorbent core <b>26</b> located between the outer cover <b>22</b> and the bodyside liner <b>24</b>. Leg elastics <b>28</b> are located generally at the longitudinal edges of the diaper <b>20</b>. The disposable diaper <b>20</b> may further comprise a front waist elastic <b>30</b> and a rear waist elastic <b>32</b>. As representatively illustrated, the disposable diaper <b>20</b> also includes mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>The outer cover <b>22</b> of the disposable diaper <b>20</b>, as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-8, may suitably be composed of a material which is either liquid permeable or liquid impermeable. It is generally preferred that the outer cover <b>22</b> be formed from a material which is substantially impermeable to liquids. For example, a typical outer cover can be manufactured from a thin plastic film or other flexible liquid-impermeable material. For example, the outer cover <b>22</b> may be formed from a polyethylene film having a thickness of from about 0.012 millimeter (0.5 mil) to about 0.051 millimeter (2.0 mils). If it is desired to present the outer cover <b>22</b> with a more clothlike feeling, the outer cover <b>22</b> may comprise a polyethylene film having a nonwoven web laminated to the outer surface thereof, such as a spunbond web of polyolefin fibers. For example, a polyethylene film having a thickness of about 0.015 millimeter (0.6 mil) may have thermally laminated thereto a sponbond web of polyolefin fibers, which fibers have a thickness of about 1.5 to 2.5 denier per filament, which nonwoven web has a basis weight of about 24 grams per square meter (0.7 ounce per square yard). Methods of forming such clothlike outer covers are known to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p>Further, the outer cover <b>22</b> may be formed of a woven or nonwoven fibrous web layer which has been totally or partially constructed or treated to impart a desired level of liquid impermeability to selected regions that are adjacent or proximate the absorbent core <b>26</b>. Still further, the outer cover <b>22</b> may optionally be composed of a micro-porous “breathable” material which permits vapors to escape from the absorbent core <b>26</b> while still preventing liquid exudates from passing through the outer cover <b>22</b>. The outer cover may be formed from an elastic material such as elastomeric films, e.g., natural or synthetic rubber; elastomeric foams, e.g., urethane foams; elastomeric nonwoven materials; laminates or composites of such elastomeric materials with other elastomeric or non-elastomeric materials, e.g., neck-bonded laminates or stretch-bonded laminates; and the like.</p>
    <p>The bodyside liner <b>24</b> if the disposable diaper <b>20</b>, as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-8, suitably presents a bodyfacing surface which is compliant, soft feeling and nonirritating to the wearer's skin. Further, the bodyside liner <b>24</b> may be less hydrophilic than the absorbent core <b>26</b>, to present a relatively dry surface to the wearer, and may be sufficiently porous to be liquid permeable, permitting liquid to readily penetrate through its thickness. A suitable bodyside liner <b>24</b> may be manufactured from a wide selection of web materials, such as porous foams, reticulated foams, apertured plastic films, natural fibers (for example, wood or cotton fibers), synthetic fibers (for example, polyester or polypropylene fibers), or a combination of natural and synthetic fibers. The bodyside liner <b>24</b> is suitably employed to help isolate the wearer's skin from liquids held in the absorbent core <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>Various woven and nonwoven fabrics can be used for the bodyside liner <b>24</b>. For example, the bodyside liner may be composed of a meltblown or spunbonded web of polyolefin fibers. The bodyside liner may also be a bonded-carded web composed of natural and/or synthetic fibers. The bodyside liner may be composed of a substantially hydrophobic material, and the hydrophobic material may, optionally, be treated with a surfactant or otherwise processed to impart a desired level of wettability and hydrophilicity. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the bodyside liner <b>24</b> comprises a nonwoven, spunbond, polypropylene fabric composed of about 2.8-3.2 denier fibers formed into a web having a basis weight of about 22 grams per square meter and a density of about 0.06 gram per cubic centimeter. The fabric is surface treated with about 0.28 weight percent of a surfactant commercially available from Rohm and Haas Co. under the trade designation TRITON X-102.</p>
    <p>Specific examples of disposable diapers on which the process of the present invention may be utilized are disclosed in the following U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications: U.S. Pat. No. 4,798,603 issued Jan. 17, 1989, to Meyer et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,668 issued Jan. 5, 1993, to Bernardin; U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,672 issued Jan. 5, 1993, to Bruemmer et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,192,606 issued Mar. 9, 1993, to Proxmire et al., and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/096,654 filed Jul. 22, 1993, in the name of Hanson et al.</p>
    <p>As representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-8, the disposable diaper <b>20</b> includes mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. The mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-8, include one component of a hook-and-loop type mechanical fasteners as are well known to those skilled in the art. Other fasteners which may be used in the present invention include cohesive materials, snaps, buttons and the like. As used herein, reference to a mechanical fastener refers to at least one component of a combination of a first fastening element which is adapted to mechanically interlock with a second fastening element. For example, the first and second fastening elements of the mechanical fasteners may include the hook material and loop material of a hook-and-loop type fastener or the male and female snap portions of a snap type fastener.</p>
    <p>For ease of understanding, much of the following description of the present invention will be made in terms of the process of attaching and protecting hook-and-loop type mechanical fasteners on disposable diapers. Nonetheless, it is to be understood that the process described is equally suited for use in attaching and protecting any other type of mechanical fasteners.</p>
    <p>Hook-and-loop type fasteners are known to those skilled in the art. The mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-8, generally comprise a hook material <b>40</b> and/or a loop material <b>42</b>. The mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may also include a fingertab <b>44</b> to improve the ease of fastening and refastening. As representatively illustrated in FIGS. 3, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>, the hook material <b>40</b> generally comprises a base sheet material <b>46</b> from which stemlike projections <b>48</b> extend. One end of each stemlike projection <b>48</b> is attached to the base sheet material <b>46</b>, while the other end of the stemlike projection <b>48</b> defines a hook, or hook-like structure, which is adapted to engage and interlock with a loop or loop-type material. The loop or loop-type material <b>42</b> generally comprises a woven or nonwoven material defining individual loops of material which can interlock with the hook or hook-like material <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>Exemplary of a hook material <b>40</b> suitable for use in the present invention is that obtained from Velcro Group Company, Manchester, N.H., under the trade designation CFM-22 and CFM-15. Suitable hook materials generally comprise from about 300 to about 1000 hooks per square inch (about 46 to about 155 per square centimeter), preferably from about 700 to about 900 hooks per square inch (about 108 to about 140 hooks per square centimeter). The hooks suitably have a height of from about 0.015 inch (0.038 centimeter) to about 0.050 inch (0.127 centimeter), preferably of from about 0.025 inch (0.0635 centimeter) to about 0.035 inch (0.0889 centimeter).</p>
    <p>Exemplary of a loop material <b>42</b> suitable for use in the present invention is that obtained from Guilford Mills, Inc., Greensboro, N.C., under the trade designation Style 19902 or Style 30020. A suitable loop material is a fabric of a raised loop construction, stabilized through napping and thermosetting such that the loops are erect from the base material. The fabric may be a two bar warp knit construction having from 21 to 41 courses per inch (8.27 to 16.4 courses per centimeter) and from 26 to 46 wales per inch (10.24 to 18.1 wales per centimeter), preferably of polyester yarn, in which 15-35 percent of the yarn is composed of yarn having about 15 or less filaments and having a yarn denier (d) within the range of about 15-30 d. In addition, about 65-85 percent of the yarns are those having 1-30 individual filaments therein and having a yarn denier within the range of about 30-50 d. The caliper is 0.010 to 0.040 inch (0.0254 to 0.1 centimeter) and basis weight from 1.0 to 3.0 ounces per square yard. Suitable loop materials also include stitch bonded materials, needled materials, nonwoven materials, laminates of a nonwoven material and a film material; malimo composites (available from Tietex and Milliken both of Spartenburg, S.C.) and the like. Other suitable loop materials are shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,019,073 issued May 28, 1991, to Roessler et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <p>In general, the first fastening element or hook material <b>40</b> will be attached to the rear periphery of the disposable diaper <b>20</b>, and the second fastening element or loop material <b>42</b> will be attached to the outer surface of the disposable diaper <b>20</b>, near a front edge of the diaper. Alternatively, the hook material <b>40</b> may be attached to the front periphery of the disposable diaper <b>20</b>, and the loop material may be attached to the outer surface of the disposable diaper <b>20</b>, near a rear edge of the diaper. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the loop material <b>42</b>, with which the hook material <b>40</b> is intended to engage, will be positioned on the disposable diaper <b>20</b> such that the mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> can be utilized to attach the disposable diaper <b>20</b> about the waist of a wearer.</p>
    <p>As representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-8, the disposable diaper <b>20</b> of the present invention may also include at least one ear tab <b>38</b>. Typically, the ear tab <b>38</b> is attached to the rear periphery of the diaper <b>20</b>. In such a configuration, the hook material <b>40</b>, can be attached to the ear tab <b>38</b>. The ear tab <b>38</b> can be made of any material which provides the desired fastening of the disposable diaper <b>20</b> about the waist of the wearer. Suitably, the ear tab <b>38</b> may be formed out of a material such as that used to form the outer cover and/or body-side liner. Suitable materials from which the ear tab may be formed include films, nonwoven materials, woven or knit materials, foams, and composites and laminates of the above materials. The ear tab may be formed from an elastic material such as elastomeric films, e.g., natural or synthetic rubber; elastomeric strands, e.g., LYCRA™ strands; elastomeric foams, e.g., urethane foams; elastomeric nonwoven materials; laminates or composites of such elastomeric materials with other elastomeric or non-elastomeric materials, e.g., neck-bonded laminates or stretch-bonded laminates; and the like. When the ear is formed from an elastic material, the elastic material can suitably be elongated to from about 75 percent to about 150 percent of its relaxed length, more specifically from about 100 percent to about 150 percent of its relaxed length. Elongations within these ranges are believed to result in the best fit in use.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, the present invention concerns a process for attaching mechanical fasteners to disposable absorbent articles and protecting the mechanical fasteners before the articles are handled by a user. To eliminate the risk of damage which can adversely impact the functioning of the mechanical fasteners, each mechanical fastener <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> must be effectively protected as the disposable absorbent article, such as the disposable diaper <b>20</b> illustrated in FIGS. 1-8, is manufactured and packaged. The process of the invention can best be understood by reference to the drawings wherein FIG. 9 illustrates a schematic view of a process according to the present invention. The process will be described in terms of attaching a hook material of a hook-and-loop type mechanical fastener to a substrate web and protecting the hook material. However, it is to be understood that the process is equally suited for attaching and protecting any type of mechanical fastener to any type of substrate web. For example, the substrate web may be the disposable diaper <b>20</b> or any components of the disposable diaper <b>20</b>, such as the outer cover <b>22</b> or bodyside line <b>24</b>, as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-8. In a particular embodiment, the process may be used to apply mechanical fasteners to the outer cover <b>22</b> or bodyside liner <b>24</b> before they are joined together to form the disposable diaper <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>As representatively illustrated in FIG. 9, a generally continuous length of a hook material <b>50</b> is provided. Typically, the hook material <b>50</b> has a base material and stemlike projections which extend from the base material. The hook material <b>50</b> may be used to provide the hook portion of the hook-and-loop type mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-8. A substrate web <b>52</b> is provided from a supply roll. The base material of the hook material <b>50</b> is attached to the substrate web <b>52</b> with the stemlike projections extending away from the substrate web <b>52</b>. Any method capable of joining different materials together is believed suitable for use in the present invention. For example, the base material of the hook material <b>50</b> may be attached to the substrate web <b>52</b> by hot or cold melt adhesives, thermal bonding (including ultrasonic bonding), sewing, combinations of these methods, and the like. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hook material <b>50</b> is attached to the substrate web <b>52</b> with both adhesive and thermal bonds. Exemplary of suitable adhesive materials are those commercially available from Findley Adhesives, Inc., Wauwatosa, Wis., under the trade designation H-2096.</p>
    <p>The composite of the hook material <b>50</b> and the substrate web <b>52</b> is then cut by a cutter <b>54</b> to form individual fastening elements <b>56</b>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that cutter <b>54</b> may comprise rotary cutters, air knives, thermal knives, pinch cutters, ultrasonic cutters, lasers, and the like. The individual fastening elements <b>56</b> are then folded in the folding area <b>58</b> about a fold line <b>60</b>. The folding area <b>58</b> suitably contains folding boards, plows, and the like, to effectuate the described folding as are well known to those skilled in the art. After the fastening elements <b>56</b> are folded over, the stemlike projections of the hook material <b>50</b> and the substrate web <b>52</b> are releasably engaged by constrictively passing between a pair of rotatable nip rolls <b>62</b>. The pressure exerted by the nip rolls <b>62</b> is any amount sufficient to provide the desired engagement. For example the pressure exerted may be at least about 70 pounds per linear inch and desirably from about 70 to about 180 pounds per linear inch.</p>
    <p>The rotatable nip rolls <b>62</b> may be of any configuration which provides the desired engagement between the stemlike projections of the hook material <b>50</b> and the substrate web <b>52</b>. For example, the rotatable nip rolls <b>62</b> may have a smooth or rough surface. In a particular embodiment as representatively illustrated in FIG. 9, at least one of the rotatable nip rolls <b>62</b> has a plurality of pins extending radially outward from its circumferential surface. The pins can improve the engagement between the stemlike projections of the hook material <b>50</b> and the substrate web <b>52</b>. For example, the pins can force the stemlike projections further into the substrate web <b>52</b> to provide improved engagement.</p>
    <p>This aspect of the invention is illustrated in FIGS. 10, <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B. FIG. 10 illustrates the nip rolls <b>62</b> illustrated in FIG. <b>9</b>. The pins <b>64</b> are illustrated on the outer surface of one of the nip rolls. FIG. 10A illustrates an enlarged view of the area from circle A in FIG. 10 showing a hook and loop material prior to engagement. FIG. 10B illustrates an enlarged view of the area from circle B in FIG. 10 showing a hook and loop material after engagement caused by the pins <b>64</b>.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, at least one of the rotatable nip rolls <b>62</b> may have a plurality of grooves or slots arranged in a cross directional configuration about its circumferential surface. Such a grooved nip roll can function to provide a scrubbing or scuffing action to releasably engage the stemlike projections of the hook material <b>50</b> and the substrate web <b>52</b> without adversely affecting or damaging the hook material <b>50</b>. FIG. 11 illustrates nip rolls <b>62</b> according to this alternative embodiment. FIG. 11 illustrates a nip roll with grooves or slots <b>66</b>. FIG. 11A illustrates an enlarged view of the area from circle A in FIG. 11 showing a hook and loop material prior to engagement. FIG. 11B illustrates an enlarged view of the area from circle B in FIG. 11 showing a hook and loop material after engagement caused by the scrubbing or scuffing action of the grooves <b>66</b> in the nip rolls <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>The engagement of the stemlike projections of the hook material <b>50</b> with the substrate web <b>52</b> must be sufficient to protect and control the hook material <b>50</b> as the composite is further manufactured and packaged for consumer sale. For example, the hook material <b>50</b> on the individual fastening elements <b>56</b> can tend to flutter at high manufacturing speeds which may damage the stemlike projections of the hook material <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>The process of the present invention, as representatively illustrated in FIG. 9, may be used to provide a disposable diaper, such as those representatively illustrated in FIGS. 2-8 wherein the hook material <b>40</b> of the hook-and-loop type mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> has been protected and controlled during the manufacturing and packaging processes. Specifically, it is important that the hook material <b>40</b> be protected up until the point in time at which the disposable diaper <b>20</b> is handled by the user. To ensure proper fastening and refastening about a wearer, the stemlike projections <b>48</b> of the hook material <b>40</b> of the hook-and-loop type mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> must not be damaged during the manufacturing and packaging processes.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 2-8 representatively illustrate several different embodiments of the present invention wherein the hook material <b>40</b> of the hook-and-loop type mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> of the disposable diapers <b>20</b> has been controlled and protected. The disposable diapers <b>20</b> include an outer cover <b>22</b>, a bodyside liner <b>24</b>, an absorbent core <b>26</b> disposed between the outer cover <b>22</b> and bodyside liner <b>24</b>, a pair of ear tabs <b>38</b>, and a pair of mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. The mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> include a hook material <b>40</b> and a loop material <b>42</b> which are attached to the disposable diaper <b>20</b>. The mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may also include a fingertab <b>44</b>. One skilled in the art will recognize that certain components of the disposable diapers <b>20</b> may be omitted such as the ear tabs <b>38</b> and fingertabs <b>44</b>, as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 2-8. In the illustrated embodiments, the hook material <b>40</b> of the hook-and-loop type mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> is releasably engaged with the disposable diaper <b>20</b> to protect the hook material <b>40</b> before the disposable diaper <b>20</b> is handled by a user.</p>
    <p>The hook material <b>40</b> may be releasably engaged with the disposable diaper <b>20</b> or any component of the disposable diaper <b>20</b> by any suitable process such as that representatively illustrated in FIG. <b>9</b>. For example, the hook material <b>40</b> and a portion of the disposable diaper <b>20</b> may be releasably engaged by passing between a pair of rotatable nip rolls <b>62</b>, as representatively illustrated in FIG. <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, the hook material <b>40</b> may be folded over and releasably engaged with the ear tabs <b>38</b> to protect the hook material <b>40</b> before the disposable diaper <b>20</b> is further manufactured and packaged for commercial sale. Alternatively, as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, the hook material <b>40</b> may be folded over and releasably engaged with the bodyside liner <b>24</b> of the disposable diaper <b>20</b>. As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 5, the stemlike projections <b>48</b> which extend from the base sheet <b>46</b> of the hook material <b>40</b> are releasably engaged with the ear tab <b>38</b> or bodyside liner <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, the hook material <b>40</b> may be folded over and releasably engaged with the outer cover <b>22</b> of the disposable diaper <b>20</b> to protect the hook material <b>40</b> before the disposable diaper <b>20</b> is further manufactured and packaged for commercial sale. As illustrated in FIG. 7, the stemlike projections <b>48</b> which extend from the base sheet <b>46</b> of the hook material <b>40</b> are releasably engaged with the outer cover <b>22</b> of the disposable diaper <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>In still another embodiment as representatively illustrated in FIG. 8, the hook material <b>40</b> may be releasably engaged with the outer cover <b>22</b> or loop material <b>42</b> of the disposable diaper <b>20</b> in a manner to provide a pant-like structure and protect the hook material <b>40</b> before the disposable diaper <b>20</b> is further manufactured and packaged for commercial sale.</p>
    <p>The disposable diaper <b>20</b> of the different embodiments of the present invention may also include one or more patches of loop material located in any desired location to releasably engage with the stemlike projections <b>48</b> of the hook material <b>40</b>. For example, a patch of loop material may be located on the ear tab <b>38</b>, outer cover <b>22</b> or bodyside liner <b>24</b> of the disposable diaper <b>20</b> to releasably engage with the stemlike projections <b>48</b> of the hook material <b>40</b> to protect the hook material <b>40</b> as the disposable diaper <b>20</b> is manufactured and packaged.</p>
    <p>In still another embodiment, the present invention provides a package which includes a plurality of disposable absorbent articles such as the disposable diapers representatively illustrated in FIGS. 2-8. The package may include at least about 1 and desirably from about 10 to about 96 disposable absorbent articles. Each of the disposable absorbent articles in the package includes mechanical fasteners which are attached and protected according to the different embodiments of the present invention. For example, wherein the mechanical fasteners are hook-and-loop type fasteners as illustrated in FIGS. 2-8, the hook material <b>40</b> of the mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> is releasably engaged with the disposable diapers <b>20</b> to protect the hook material <b>40</b> before the disposable absorbent articles are handled by the user.</p>
    <p>In the different embodiments of the present invention as representatively illustrated in FIGS. 1-9, the releasable engagement of the hook material <b>40</b> of the mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> with the disposable diaper <b>20</b> must be sufficient to ensure adequate protection of the mechanical fasteners <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. Specifically, the stemlike projections <b>48</b> of the hook material <b>40</b> must be sufficiently engaged in the disposable diaper <b>20</b> to avoid separation in both a shear mode (force generally parallel to the plane of engagement) and a peel mode (force generally perpendicular to the plane of engagement) during the manufacturing and packaging processes. For example, it is desirable that the stemlike projections <b>48</b> of the hook material <b>40</b> be releasably engaged with the disposable diaper to provide a peel strength of at least about 20 grams, desirably from about 20 to about 1500 grams and more desirably from about 30 to about 90 grams. As used herein, the term “peel strength” refers to the peel strength as determined using the Peel Strength Test as set forth in conjunction with the Examples below. The peel strength values set forth above are intended to be independent of the size or shape of the hook material <b>40</b>. That is, the peel strength values are not normalized to take into account the area of the hook material. It is only desired that the overall hook material, when engaged, display a peak load of failure within the above ranges.</p>
    <p>The different embodiments of the present invention, provide a process for attaching and protecting mechanical fasteners on disposable absorbent articles and a product produced by the same. The present invention provides for the control and protection of the mechanical fasteners as the disposable absorbent articles are manufactured and packaged. This is particularly true when the mechanical fasteners are hook-and-loop type fasteners. For example, in the present invention, the stemlike projections of the hook material of the hook-and-loop type fasteners are controlled and protected to reduce or eliminate damage to the hook material during the manufacturing and packaging processes. The undamaged hook material can then provide improved fastening and refastening of the disposable absorbent articles about the waist of the wearer. Thus, the different embodiments of the present invention render the use of mechanical fasteners, such as hook-and-loop type fasteners, on disposable absorbent articles more feasible.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLES</heading> <p>Peel Strength Test</p>
    <p>This test procedure determines the peak load, measured in grams force, required to remove a hook material of a hook-and-loop type mechanical fastener from a substrate such as a disposable absorbent article. The direction of removal (peel) of the hook material from the substrate is that direction in which the hook material would generally be removed from a substrate when the product is in use. This direction is generally perpendicular to a longitudinal centerline of the product.</p>

    <heading>Example 1</heading> <p>Ten samples of disposable diapers which are substantially the same as the diaper representatively illustrated in FIG. 4 were prepared according to the process of the present invention (commercially available Huggies® Supreme diapers; Kimberly-Clark Corporation). The diapers were removed from the package in which they had been inserted into for commercial sale. The hook material of the hook-and-loop type mechanical fastener in the diapers was commercially available from Velcro U.S.A. under the trade designation CFM-22-856. The hook material had a width of 2.00 inches and a length of 0.5 inches. The stemlike projections of the hook material were engaged with the bodyside liner before the diapers were packaged and processed according to the process of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The bodyside liner of the disposable diaper comprises a polypropylene spunbond material having a basis weight of 0.6 ounce per square yard. The hook material was folded over and engaged with the bodyside liner of the disposable diaper by passing through a pair of nip rolls which exerted a pressure of about 100 pounds per linear inch.</p>
    <p>The samples were then subjected to the Peel Strength Test described above. The samples had an average peel strength of 67.3 grams-force. As used herein, the term “average” refers to the sum of the tested value of two or more samples divided by the total number of samples.</p>
    <heading>Example 2</heading> <p>Ten samples of disposable diapers were prepared and were substantially the same as the diapers in Example 1 except that the hook material was embedded in the ear tab material, such as is representatively illustrated in FIG. <b>3</b>. The diapers were removed from the package in which they had been inserted into for commercial sale. The hook material of the hook-and-loop type mechanical fastener was commercially available from Velcro U.S.A. under the trade designation CFM-22-856. The hook material had a width of 2.00 inches and a length of 0.5 inches.</p>
    <p>The ear tab material of the disposable diaper comprises a neck bonded laminate material comprising two outer layers of a 1.2 ounce per square yard polypropylene spunbond fabric (2 denier fibers) and a center layer of a 45 gram per square meter meltblown elastomeric material (KRAYTON™ Styrene-butadiene block copolymer). Said laminate having a basis weight of 120 grams per square meter. The hook material was folded over and the stemlike projections of the hook material were engaged with the ear tab material by passing a roller over the hook material in one complete cycle. The roller was a 4.5 pound, rubber covered, handheld roller which was commercially available from Chemsultants International, a business having offices in Mentor, Ohio. A complete cycle is defined as one pass over the material in one direction and a second pass over the material in the opposite direction with each pass taking about one second in time. The samples were then subjected to the Peel Strength Test described above. The samples had an average peel strength of 31.2 grams-force.</p>
    <heading>Example 3</heading> <p>Ten samples of disposable diapers were prepared and were substantially the same as the diapers in Example 1 except that the hook material was embedded in the outer cover of the diaper, such as is representatively illustrated in FIG. <b>6</b>. The diapers were removed from the package in which they had been inserted into for commercial sale. The hook material of the hook-and-loop type mechanical fastener was commercially available from Velcro U.S.A. under the trade designation CFM-22-856. The hook material had a width of 2.00 inches and a length of 0.5 inches.</p>
    <p>The outer cover of the disposable diaper comprises a stretch thermal laminate material comprising a 0.6 mil (0.015 millimeter) polypropylene blown film and a 0.7 ounce per square yard (23.8 gsm) polypropylene spunbond material (2 denier fibers). Such a material forms the outer cover of a HUGGIES® Supreme diaper commercially available from Kimberly-Clark Corporation. The hook material was folded over and the stemlike projections of the hook material were engaged with the outer cover of the diaper by passing a roller over the hook material in one complete cycle. The roller was a 4.5 pound, rubber covered, handheld roller which was commercially available from Chemsultants International, a business having offices in Mentor, Ohio. A complete cycle is defined as one pass over the material in one direction and a second pass over the material in the opposite direction with each pass taking about one second in time.</p>
    <p>The samples were then subjected to the Peel Strength Test described above. The samples had an average peel strength of 35.4 grams-force.</p>
    <heading>Example 4</heading> <p>Ten samples of disposable diapers were prepared and were substantially the same as the diapers in Example 1 except that the hook material was embedded in the loop material of the diaper, such as is representatively illustratively in FIG. <b>8</b>. The diapers were removed from the package in which they had been inserted into for commercial sale. The hook material of the hook-and-loop type mechanical fastener was commercially available from Velcro U.S.A. under the trade designation CFM-22-856. The hook material had a width of 2.00 inches and a length of 0.5 inches.</p>
    <p>The loop material of the disposable diaper comprises a 2 bar, warp knit fabric available from Guilford Mills, Inc., Greensborough, N.C. under the trade designation #34285. The loop material has a basis weight of 35 grams per square meter. The hook material was folded over and the stemlike projections of the hook material were engaged with the loop material of the diaper by passing a roller over the hook material in one complete cycle. The roller was a 4.5 pound, rubber covered, handheld roller which was commercially available from Chemsultants International, a business having offices in Mentor, Ohio. A complete cycle is defined as one pass over the material in one direction and a second pass over the material in the opposite direction with each pass taking about one second in time.</p>
    <p>The samples were then subjected to the Peel Strength Test described above. The samples had an average peel strength of 453.5 grams-force.</p>
    <p>As can be seen from the examples, the process of the present invention provides adequate engagement and peel strength between the hook material and the disposable diaper to ensure that the hook material is protected during any further manufacturing and packaging processes. As can be seen, the peel strength should be at least about 20 grams force to ensure that the hook material remains engaged.</p>
    <p>While the present invention has been described in detail with respect to specific aspects thereof, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, upon attaining an understanding of the foregoing, may readily conceive of alterations to, variations of and equivalents to these aspects. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should be assessed as that of the appended claims and any equivalents thereto.</p>
