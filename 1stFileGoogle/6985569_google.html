In a carrier network, the name of a second party called by a first party is inserted in an event record, so that the second party's name may be included in a bill for the call.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">The invention relates to a communications system and method, and, more particularly, to a communications system and method for identifying a party, such as a called party or a party whose number is requested in an information assistance call, in bills for communications services.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">It is a common experience to use a wireless or wireline telephone, and other such communications devices, to call a telephone operator for information assistance. In a typical information assistance call, a caller (customer) identifies to the operator the name and address, or sometimes city or area code, of a party whose telephone number is desired. In response, the operator locates the desired destination number using a computer database, for example. The destination number may be provided to the customer by a computerized voice server, and the customer may be afforded the option of being connected to the destination number without the need to first terminate the information assistance call.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Even though a customer subscribes to a telephone service provided by a particular carrier, such as AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc., or branding partner, such as Virgin, the information assistance service system accessed through the telephone service may be contracted by the carrier to different independent contractors. Therefore, when a subscriber to the carrier makes an information assistance call by dialing such typical access digits as “411,” “*555,” “555-1212,” “00,” “1-800-555-1212,” etc., because of the contractual relationship, the carrier routes the information assistance call to its contracted information assistance service system to handle the information request.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Independent information assistance service providers may offer different information assistance services and service features in addition to directory assistance. For example, upon request, an operator may provide a user with information on regional restaurants, movie listings, directions to various places, etc., as well as the ability to purchase goods and services. The assignee of the present application is an information assistance service system which offers, among others, personalized services and special service features-that are different than or lacking from other providers. For instance, one such service feature is a StarBack® service feature described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,092, whereby a caller, after being connected to a desired party, may be connected back to the information assistance service system by pressing a “*” key on their telephone, or otherwise issuing a command (saying the word “operator”, for example). Examples of the assignee's personalized services include private directory assistance and foreign language directory assistance, which are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,966,437 and International Publication No. WO 01/35621.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">When a customer is connected to an information assistance system contracted by the customer's carrier, the customer is typically billed for information assistance services provided in the call and connection charges, through their carrier. These information assistance services include directory assistance and enhanced services, such as the aforementioned STARBACK® service. The connection charges include any applicable long distance and/or local toll charges (imposed by the carrier), any airtime charges (imposed by the carrier), and any other charges, such as paging and messaging charges, which are imposed or incurred when performing the information assistance service. Charges imposed by the information assistance service system may be billed on a per call basis, or may be billed, depending upon a variety of factors, such as the duration of the information assistance/operator time, or the event type or class of information searched.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Bills are typically compiled from event records, such as call detail records (“CDRs”), generated at a call center. For example, upon receipt of a directory assistance call, a carrier switch may generate a CDR and direct the call to the contracted information assistance service system. A servicing switch at the information assistance service system may generate a CDR upon receipt of the call from the carrier switch. Each “event” during the course of a call may cause generation of a CDR by a component of the call center involved in that event. An “event” may be any activity at the call center related to handling of the call. Examples of events include receiving an information assistance call, queuing a call while waiting for an operator to become available, connecting the call to an available operator, conducting a search of a database for directory assistance or other services, activating a voice response unit (VRU), connection to a destination number, etc. The generation of CDRs for such events is described in application Ser. No. 09/777,061, filed on Feb. 5, 2001, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated by reference, herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">The CDR or CDRs generated during a communication contain the communication related information necessary to compute a bill for the communication, such as call duration, toll connection, information assistance service, and the type and/or class of information service provided, to the extent that charges vary depending upon the type of information service provided. CDRs are sent to a billing platform, which compiles the CDRs for each call and for calls for each customer. The billing platform may be at the carrier, information assistance service system or a third party to generate a bill.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Typical bills for direct dial telephone services identify the date, time, called phone number and duration of the call, and the geographic location of the called party. Information assistance calls, which may be included in the same bill as direct dial calls provided by the carrier, may only include the date of the information assistance call. It may also include the requested phone number. If the information assistance call is connected to the requested phone number, the date, time, phone number and geographic location of the called party, which may be an individual or business, for example, will appear on the bill, as if the call was dialed directly by the customer.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">When a customer reviews a telephone bill, the customer may not recognize the called number or remember who was called on a particular date at a particular geographic location. Believing that they have been misbilled, the customer may call their carrier to request credit for the call. Often, the call was not misbilled, but much time and expense is accrued to clarify the situation. Perceptions by customers of being misbilled, even when erroneous, may also generate ill will. An improved system for handling credit inquiries and processing credit requests is described in more detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/160,415, filed on May 31, 2002, assigned to the assignee of the present application and incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">U.S. Patent Application Publication US 2001/0017915 A1 (the '915 application), published on Aug. 30, 2001, describes a system and method of creating a billing record including a called party's name, to facilitate review of a bill by a customer. In the '915 application, a phone number of a called party is extracted from an original event record after a call is completed, by a billing system. A database correlating phone numbers with corresponding parties' names is queried to identify the name of a party associated with the called number. A modified call record is then created including the party's name. A billing record is created from the modified call record. This process is repeated for each call in a billing time period to create a bill. While providing a called party's name in a bill would eliminate some erroneous requests for credit, the disclosed method is complex and may be expensive to implement.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0012">The embodiments of the present invention provide a simple way to convey information to a billing platform to incorporate a second party's name in a bill.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In an information assistance service system, a first party calls or otherwise communicates with the system to request a phone number or other such communications number of a second party. In one aspect of the present invention, in an information assistance service system, at least one indicator of the second party, such as the name and/or address of the second party, is inserted into an event record, such as a Call Detail Record (“CDR”), so that it may be readily included in a bill for the service. Since the first party provides the second party's name to the information assistance service system, the name is readily available for insertion into the event record without requiring that the billing platform search for the name, as in the prior art.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">In another aspect of the invention, a carrier network identifies and inserts at least one indicator, such as a name and/or address of a second party being called or otherwise communicated with by a first party initiating the communication, into the event record. In this case, the carrier network identifies the communications number of the second party, from call set up signals, for example, and searches for a name corresponding to the communications number. The carrier network may search a database correlating communications numbers and indicators of a party associated with a respective communications number. The database may be part of the carrier network or may be part of a third party, such as an information assistance service system. A directory assistance database of an information assistance service system may be adapted to be searched for an indicator corresponding to a number. The event record may be generated and the indicator inserted in real time, during processing of the communications connection between the first and second party.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method of operating an information assistance service system is disclosed comprising establishing a communication with a first party seeking a communications number of a second party. A name of the second party is received from the first party and an event record related to the communication is generated including at least one indicator of the second party, such as the second party's name and/or address. For example, the second party's name and/or address may be stored in a memory location and copied into the event record. The second party's name may be copied from the first memory location into a second memory location and from the second memory location into the event record. The second memory location may be part of the same memory device as the first memory location, or a separate memory device. For example, the second memory location may be associated with a database server, which may search a database for a communications number associated with the name stored in the second memory location. The first memory location may be associated with another component of the system. The database may be a national, a local, a private, a proprietary, a shared and/or an international database. The second party's name may be input to the memory by an input device or a voice recognition unit, for example. The event record including the second party's name, may be sent to a billing platform, which may be part of the information assistance service system, part of a carrier or part of another third party. The event record generated may be an original event record. There is no need to modify event records, as in the prior art.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">In another aspect of this embodiment of the invention, an information assistance communications system is disclosed comprising means for receiving signals to establish a communication with a first party requesting the communications number of the second party, means for receiving a name of the second party from the first party and means for generating an event record related to the communication, including at least one indicator of the second party.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">In another aspect of this embodiment, an information assistance communications system is disclosed comprising an interface to receive signals to establish a communication with a first party requesting a communications number of a second party and a processor coupled to the interface. The processor is programmed to cause generation of an event record related to the communication, including at least one indicator of the second party, such as the party's name and/or address. The system may further comprise a database correlating indicators of parties and corresponding communications numbers. The system may further comprise an operator or a voice recognition unit enabling input of a party's name. The system may further comprise memory to store a party's name to be searched. The processor may be programmed to cause the party's name stored in memory to be inserted into the event record. Second memory may also be provided. The processor may copy the party's name from the first memory to the second memory, and from the second memory to the event record.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method of operating a communications system is disclosed comprising processing a communications connection between a first communications device of a first party initiating a communication with a second communications device of a second party. An event record is generated related to the communication, including at least one indicator of the second party, such as the second party's name and/or address. The event record is generated during processing of the communications connection. The at least one indicator may be identified and inserted into the event record during processing of the communications connection. The indicator may be identified by a database correlating communications number with indicators. The communications number may be derived from call set up signals. The database may be part of a third party, such as an information assistance service system.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">In another aspect of this embodiment of the invention, a communications system is disclosed comprising means for processing a communications connection between a first communications device of a first party initiating a communication and a second communications device of a second party and means for generating an event record related to the communication, including at least one indicator of the second party, during processing of the communications connection.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">In accordance with another aspect of this embodiment, a communications system for establishing a communication is disclosed comprising an interface to receive signals from a first communications device of a first party to process a communications connection with a second communications device of a second party and a processor programmed to generate an event record including at least one indicator of the second party, during processing of the communications connection. The processor may be programmed to generate the event record, access a database correlating communications numbers with indicator's of a party associated with a respective communications number and insert a retrieved indicator into the event record. The database may be part of the communications system or may be part of a third party, such as an information assistance service system. The indicator may be a name and/or address of a party associated with the communications number, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method of operating a communications system is disclosed comprising establishing a communication connection between a first communications device of a first party and a second communications device of a second party. At least one indicator of the second party is then inserted into an original event record generated by the communications system for the communication.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method of operating a communications system is disclosed comprising connecting an information assistance communication to an information assistance service system, wherein, in the communication, a first party is seeking a communications number of a second party. A communications connection between the first party and the second party is processed after the communications number of the second party is identified. At least one indicator of the second party is inserted into an event record generated by the communications system for the connection, while processing the connection.

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0035">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, an indicator, such as a name and/or address, of a party associated with a communication, is included in a bill related to the communication. For example, in an information assistance call, where a first party calls an information assistance service system to request a phone number or other such communications number of a second party and optionally be connected to the second party, an indicator, such as the name and/or address of the second party, is included in a bill for the information assistance call. The party may be an individual or a business, for example. In another example, in a phone call or other such communication from a first party to a second party, the name and/or address of the second party is included in a bill for the call. The second party's name may be inserted into an event record, such as a Call Detail Record (“CDR”), in real time, during the processing of the communication. By including the name of the party associated with the communication in a bill, a customer's review of the bill is facilitated and improper requests for credit may be decreased. Inserting the name in real time, during call processing, is more efficient than searching for party's names and modifying event records during off-line bill processing, as in the prior art. This is particularly true in the case of information assistance calls, where the party's name is readily available because it is provided by the customer calling for information assistance.</p>
    <p num="p-0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of a communications system <b>10</b> implementing embodiments of the present invention. In this example, the communications system is an information assistance service system. The information assistance service system <b>10</b> includes a plurality of operators dispersed throughout a wide coverage area in information assistance service centers (“IASCs”) <b>21</b> through <b>27</b>. IASCs <b>21</b> through <b>27</b> are coupled to each other and to one or more billing platforms <b>30</b> through a network <b>40</b>. In this example, each of IASCs <b>21</b> through <b>27</b> covers one or more regional coverage areas. The network may be a wide area network (“WAN”) <b>40</b> covering an extensive area, for example. WAN <b>40</b> can be an Internet-based network, such as the World Wide Web, or a private intranet based network. The information assistance service system may be accessed directly by a user on a wireline phone, wireless phone, personal data assistant (“PDA”), personal information manager (“PIM”), Blackberry and other communications devices. While information assistance service system <b>10</b> in this example includes a plurality of IASCs <b>21</b> through <b>27</b>, the invention may be implemented in a system including a single IASC coupled to a billing platform <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">Billing platform <b>30</b> may comprise a call detail record (“CDR”) database <b>32</b>, a billing compiler <b>34</b> and a billing server <b>36</b>. CDR database <b>32</b> collects and stores CDRs generated by IASCs <b>21</b> through <b>27</b>. Billing compiler <b>34</b> is a processor or computer that compiles CDRs related to the same call and to the same customer. CDRs related to the same call may be identified by a common identification number assigned to each CDR by an IASC <b>21</b> through <b>27</b> handling a particular communication, as described below. CDRs related to the same customer may be identified by an automatic number identification (“ANI”) of a communications device (such as a wireline or wireless phone) associated with a particular customer and incorporated in the CDR. A customer may have multiple communications devices with respective ANIs. Each ANI may cause generation of a separate bill or the charges for each communications device may also be compiled into a single bill.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">Billing server <b>36</b> generates a billing record, which may be a customer bill, or a precursor to a customer's bill, based on the compiled CDRs, which include information from which charges may be derived, as discussed above. Billing server <b>36</b> computes appropriate charges for each communication based on stored rate information and the CDRs, formats each bill and prints the bill to be mailed to a customer. An electronic bill may be generated instead of or along with the printed bill, for being e-mailed or otherwise sent electronically to the customer. The bill may also be made available through a website of the communications service, for example. Billing server <b>36</b> also stores the generated bills and the underlying CDRs in appropriate memory (not shown) for later reference. If the billing hub is part of a third party, a precursor to a bill is typically generated by billing server <b>36</b>. The precursor is provided to information service system <b>10</b> for final formatting and presentation to a customer, by mail, e-mail or through the website.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">Billing platform <b>30</b> may be part of information assistance service system <b>10</b>, part of a carrier, and/or it may be a third party. While a single CDR database <b>32</b>, billing compiler <b>34</b> and CDR server <b>36</b> are shown, it is understood that multiple databases, compilers and servers may be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example of an IASC <b>100</b> (generically representing each of IASC <b>21</b> through <b>27</b>), embodying the principles of one embodiment of the invention. IASC <b>100</b> provides information assistance services and enables the name and/or address or other such indicator of a party called or a party whose number is requested, to be provided in a billing record, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. IASC <b>100</b> includes information assistance service provider (“IASP”) <b>102</b> and servicing platform <b>104</b>. Servicing platform <b>104</b> may be part of or separate from IASP <b>102</b>. Servicing platform <b>104</b> may be located in the same geographic area as or in a different geographic area than the associated IASP <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">Servicing platform <b>104</b> includes an interface, such as a servicing switch <b>106</b>, and a switch host computer <b>107</b>. Switch <b>106</b> is a conventional switch connected via one or more external T1 links <b>108</b>, including digital T1 links, to one or more carrier networks (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). T1 links <b>108</b> may be voice, data or video connections through which incoming and outgoing voice, data, and/or video communications can be made. Outgoing communications may be placed over the same or different carrier networks than the carrier network on which the incoming communication was received. Switch <b>106</b> includes digital signal processing circuitry (DSPs). Thus, switch <b>106</b> can be programmed and reprogrammed to function as, among other things, call progress analyzers (CPAs), call progress generators (CPGs), multi-frequency (MF) tone generators/detectors, dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) generators/detectors, and/or conferencing units, depending upon the demand placed on IASP <b>102</b> and switch <b>106</b> for each corresponding function.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">Switch host computer <b>107</b> may be programmed to control the operation of servicing switch <b>106</b>, as well as the operation of the components of IASP <b>102</b> described below. Switch host computer <b>107</b> includes memory <b>107</b> <i>a</i>. Switch host computer <b>107</b> and switch <b>106</b> may be private branch exchange (“PBX”) components. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in contrast, an IASP <b>700</b> is shown without a PBX switch and host computer.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">IASP <b>102</b> includes operator devices, such as operator telephones <b>112</b> and operator terminals <b>114</b>, handled by a respective operator. Each terminal <b>114</b> may include memory <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, and a monitor, mouse and keyboard with associated dialing pad (not shown). Operator telephones <b>112</b> are coupled to channel bank <b>116</b> in IASP <b>102</b>. Channel bank <b>110</b> is coupled to switch <b>106</b> in servicing platform <b>104</b> via an internal T1 link <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">Operator terminals <b>114</b> are coupled over data network <b>118</b> to database server <b>120</b>, which is coupled to directory assistance database <b>121</b>. While only one database server <b>120</b> and database <b>121</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, multiple servers and/or databases may be provided. Terminals <b>114</b> are generally provided with web browsing capabilities, telephone facilities and fully-featured operator user interface applications, which facilitate the searching, retrieval and administering of database <b>121</b> through server <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">Data network <b>118</b> includes, but is not limited to, a LAN. The LAN may connect to other similar remote LANs to form WAN <b>40</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. LANs may be connected to one another and/or to the Internet via routers and/or other conventional means. Thus, data network <b>118</b> enables an operator to access public directory information, private directory information, and/or other information available over the Internet.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">An operator may submit a request for a party's phone number (wireline or wireless), or other such communications number of a party's communications device, to database server <b>120</b> through operator terminal <b>114</b>. Database server <b>120</b> may search directory assistance database <b>121</b> in response to the request. If a number is located, it is retrieved by database server <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">Information assistance service provider <b>102</b> may also include voice response unit (“VRU”) <b>122</b>, which is also coupled to data network <b>118</b>. VRU <b>122</b> plays the constantly repeated parts of an operator's speech, namely, the various greetings and signoffs (or closings), and the retrieved telephone number of the party requested by the customer, under the control of switch host computer <b>107</b>. VRU <b>122</b> may also have voice recognition capability, so that it can interpret verbal statements made by a customer. For example, instead of connecting a call to an operator, switch host computer <b>107</b> may connect the call to VRU <b>122</b>, which may request that the customer recite a requested party's name, as discussed further, below.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">VRU <b>122</b> may comprise a general purpose computer including memory <b>122</b> <i>a </i>and one or more voice cards for voice recognition, voice recording and playback, and call progress analysis. VRU <b>122</b> is connected to servicing switch <b>106</b> via a T1 line. If more than one VRU <b>122</b> is provided, each one is connected to switch <b>106</b> via a separate T1 link. VRU <b>122</b> is also coupled to switch host computer <b>107</b> through data network <b>118</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">At appropriate stages in a call's progression, host computer <b>107</b> initiates a voice path connection between VRU <b>122</b> and switch <b>106</b>, such that the customer or the customer and the operator are able to hear whatever pre-recorded speech is played on that connection by VRU <b>122</b>. Computer <b>107</b> then instructs VRU <b>122</b>, via data network <b>118</b>, what type of message to play, and passes data parameters that enable VRU <b>122</b> to locate the message appropriate to the call state.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">To access IASP <b>100</b> of information assistance service system <b>10</b>, customers of a particular telephone carrier or company may dial, speak or otherwise communicate the access digits, access codes or retail numbers established for information assistance by that carrier to access information assistance service system <b>10</b>. For example, the predetermined access digits may be “411,” “*555,” “555-1212,” “1-800-555-1212,” “00,” or other designated access numbers. Upon receiving such access digits from a customer's communications device, the participating telephone carrier's switching system routes the call to an IASC <b>100</b> of information assistance service system <b>10</b>(via a T1 link), where it appears as an incoming call. Customers and other users of information assistance service system <b>10</b> may also call the system directly, in which case the call is also received by servicing switch <b>106</b> along one of the T1 links <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">To connect a call to an IASC <b>100</b>, a carrier network switch (not shown) of a participating carrier sends call setup signals containing data concerning the call, such as an ANI of the originating communications device, a dialed number identification string (DNIS) identifying the dialed telephone number or other such communications number, the area of the call's originating site, and/or a customer identification number assigned by the carrier, to servicing switch <b>106</b>. The received set-up signals are monitored and processed by switch host computer <b>107</b>, which assigns a call sequence number to the call, to uniquely identify the call within the information assistance system <b>100</b>. A CDR is created for each call by switch <b>106</b>, based on this information.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">The call may be directed to an operator device, such as operator telephone <b>112</b> and operator terminal <b>116</b> of an available operator, by switch <b>106</b> under the control of switch host computer <b>107</b>. Automatic call distribution (ACD) logic, which may reside in switch host computer <b>107</b> or elsewhere in system <b>100</b>, may be used to queue (if necessary) and distribute calls to available operators at operator devices in the order in which they are received, to evenly distribute the call traffic among the operators. Other distribution logic schemes may be used, instead, such as skills-based routing or a priority scheme for preferred callers.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">After connection to an operator, a customer may request the phone number of a party (referred to as a “requested party”). The requested party's address may be requested, as well. The operator may enter the name of the requested party into a field of a graphical user interface (“GUI”), which may be a form template appearing on the display of the operator's terminal <b>116</b>, through a keyboard or other such input device. The entered name is stored in memory <b>114</b> <i>a </i>in a location corresponding to the name field of the GUI. The operator submits the requested party's name to database server <b>120</b> via data network <b>118</b> by clicking on a button or tab on the screen or depressing a key on the keyboard. Database server <b>120</b> stores the name in memory <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and conducts a search of directory database <b>121</b> for a communications number associated with the name. The name may be stored in switch host computer memory <b>107</b> <i>a </i>when the name is submitted to database server <b>120</b>, as well. Database server <b>120</b> may not find a communications number corresponding to the exact name given by the customer, in database <b>121</b>. The name might be in a different form. For example, in the database, only the first initial of the first name may be stored with the last name. The customer may give a nickname instead of the full first name, as well. Database server may store the name as it appears on the database in memory <b>120</b> <i>a</i>, as well as the name given by the customer. The name inserted into the CDR, and ultimately the bill, is preferably the name given by the customer, which is input to IASP <b>100</b> and stored in memory. Alternatively, the name as it appears in the database may be used, instead. In that case, the name may be retrieved from the database, stored in memory and copied into an event record.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">If a phone number or other such communications number corresponding to the requested party's name is found, the number may be stored in memory <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and may then be sent to the requesting operator terminal <b>114</b> by database server <b>120</b>. The retrieved number may be stored in memory <b>114</b> <i>a </i>and displayed on the operator's monitor. The customer may be verbally informed of the number by the operator. Alternatively, the number may be provided to VRU <b>122</b> via switch host computer <b>107</b>, and stored in memory <b>122</b> <i>a</i>. VRU <b>122</b> may then generate a message reciting the number.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">The name may be input by a customer using a keypad on their communications device, as well.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">The information assistance call may then be terminated or the customer may be given the option of being connected with the communications number (i.e. telephone number) of the requested party, as is known in the art. The option may be presented by the operator or by VRU <b>122</b>. The customer may accept the option by a verbal indication to the operator or VRU <b>122</b> or by entry of data through the customer's phone or other communications device. Entry of data may involve depression of one or more particular keys on a keypad of the communications device, for example. If the call is connected to the requested party, servicing switch <b>106</b> sends call setup signals for the call, including the requested party's number as a DNIS, to a carrier switch. The information assistance call is completed. The connection between the customer and the IASP <b>10</b> may be terminated or it may be maintained in order to provide additional information assistance via the well-known StarBack(R) feature.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">Instead of connecting the call to an operator at an operator device, switch host computer <b>107</b> may connect the call to VRU <b>122</b> to request verbal input of a requested party's name and/or to present other options, as is known in the art. If VRU <b>122</b> can identify the name, the name is stored in VRU memory <b>122</b> <i>a </i>and conveyed to data server <b>120</b> via data network <b>118</b>, to conduct a search, as described above. If VRU <b>122</b> cannot identify the requested party's name, the call is connected to an operator device by switch host computer <b>107</b> for handling by an operator, as described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">As discussed above, each component of IASC <b>100</b> involved in an “event” or activity may generate an event record or CDR to document the event and provide data for billing. For example, when a communication is received, servicing switch <b>106</b> may generate a CDR, under the control of switch host computer <b>107</b>. When the communication is connected to an operator telephone <b>112</b> and terminal <b>114</b>, terminal <b>114</b> or switch host computer <b>107</b> may generate a CDR. If the call is queued, switch host computer <b>107</b> may generate a CDR. When the operator sends a search request such as a search for a phone number corresponding to a requested party's name, terminal <b>114</b> may generate a CDR. When database service <b>120</b> conducts a search, database server <b>120</b> may generate a CDR. Generation of multiple event records is discussed in application Ser. No. 09/777,061, filed on Feb. 5, 2001, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference, herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a CDR includes an indicator of the requested party, such as the requested party's name and/or address, facilitating generation of a bill including the indicator. Embodiments of the invention may be implemented where CDRs are generated by multiple respective components of IASP <b>100</b>, as described above and in application Ser. No. 09/777,061, or only one CDR is generated, such as by servicing switch <b>106</b>. If multiple CDRs are generated by multiple components of IASP <b>100</b>, any one including an indicator of the requested party may be used to provide the requested party's name to billing platform <b>30</b>. In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, an original CDR may be generated including a name field. The name field may be populated, along with other fields of the CDR, when the CDR is first generated. The generation and population of the CDR may take place in real-time, while the communication is being handled by IASP <b>100</b>. it is not, therefore, necessary to modify a CDR later, during bill processing, as in the prior art. In other words, an indicator, such as a name and/or address, may be inserted into an original CDR.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">A method in accordance with an embodiment of the invention will now be described with respect to the flowchart <b>200</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">Upon receipt of a request for the phone number of a party from the customer, the name of a requested party is stored in step <b>202</b>. The name may be stored in memory <b>114</b> <i>a </i>when the operator enters the requested party's name into a field of a GUI, through a keyboard or other such input device, for example. If the communication is being handled by VRU <b>122</b>, the requested party's name may be stored in VRU memory <b>122</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0062">A search for the requested party's phone number or other such communications number is conducted in step <b>204</b>. A request for a party's address may also be made. For example, the operator may submit the requested party's name entered in the GUI to database server <b>120</b> via data network <b>118</b> by clicking on a button or tab on the GUI or by depressing a key on the keyboard. If the requested party's name has been submitted to VRU <b>122</b>, the name may be conveyed from VRU memory <b>122</b> <i>a </i>to data server <b>120</b> via data network <b>118</b>. The name may be stored in memory <b>120</b> <i>a </i>in database server <b>120</b>, which then conducts a search of directory database <b>121</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">The number of the requested party is stored in step <b>206</b>. For example, the number may be initially stored in memory <b>120</b> <i>a </i>of database server <b>120</b>. It may then be conveyed via data network <b>118</b> to memory <b>114</b> <i>a </i>in the operator terminal <b>114</b> and displayed to the operator, or to memory <b>122</b> <i>a </i>in VRU <b>122</b>, for example. The number may also be conveyed to memory <b>107</b> <i>a </i>in switch host computer <b>107</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">The customer is informed of the number in step <b>208</b>. The customer may be informed verbally by the operator, who may read the number displayed at terminal <b>114</b>, or by a message generated by VRU <b>122</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">After the number of the requested party is provided to the customer in step <b>208</b>, the customer may be given the option of being connected with the located number, in step <b>210</b>. The option may be presented by the operator or VRU <b>122</b>. The customer may select one of the options by a verbal indication to the operator or VRU <b>122</b> or by entry of data through the customer's phone or other communications device. Entry of data may involve depression of one or more particular keys on a keypad of the communications device, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">If the customer accepts the option, the call is connected to the number, in step <b>212</b>, via a carrier network, as is known in the art. The communication with IASC <b>100</b> is terminated and the requested party's name may be inserted into a CDR, in step <b>214</b>. The operator may terminate the communication by clicking on a COMPLETE button or tab on the GUI or depressing a key on the keyboard, for example. The communication between the customer and the IASC <b>100</b> is then disconnected. In step <b>214</b>, the requested party's name may be transferred from the field in the GUI to a name field in the CDR upon the operator's indication of the completion of the communication or upon the disconnection of the communication, by terminal <b>114</b> or switch host computer <b>107</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">If the customer declines the option of being connected to the requested party in step <b>210</b> or if the system does not offer that option, the call is terminated and the requested party's indicator, such as their name and/or address, may be inserted into a CDR in step <b>214</b> by switch <b>106</b>, for example, as discussed above.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">The requested party's name may be inserted into a CDR at other steps in the process, in addition to or instead of in step <b>214</b>. For example, if the components of IASP <b>100</b> have the capability of generating CDRs, as described in application Ser. No. 09/777,061, described in more detail above, operator terminal <b>114</b> or VRU <b>122</b> may copy the requested party's name from memory <b>114</b> <i>a </i>or <b>122</b> <i>a</i>, respectively, into a CDR under the control of switch host computer <b>107</b>, after the requested party's name is stored in step <b>202</b>. Database server <b>120</b> may copy the requested party's name from memory <b>120</b> <i>a </i>into a CDR during documentation of the conducting of a search or the retrieval of a number, after step <b>204</b> or step <b>205</b>. Database server <b>120</b> may copy the requested party's address from database <b>120</b> <i>a </i>into memory <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and into a CDR, as well. Switch host computer <b>107</b> could also acquire the requested party's name, store it in memory <b>107</b> <i>a </i>and copy it into a CDR at any point.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">The CDR is sent to a billing platform in step <b>216</b>. As discussed above, the billing platform, such as billing platform <b>30</b>, may be part of the information assistance service system <b>10</b>, a carrier or a third party.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">As discussed above, billing platform <b>30</b> may generate final bills or precursors to bills. Information assistance service system <b>10</b> may offer to provide billing entries with indicators, such as a party's name and/or address, as an option to customers. Customers may select an option among the following, for example: 1) providing both name and address, 2) providing the name or address, 3) providing another indicator or 4) providing no indicators. The customer may make such a selection during registration or any time after that. The customer may change their selection at any time. Based on the option selected by the customer, information assistance service system <b>10</b> may format a bill into a final form.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">After the call is connected to the requested party via a carrier network in step <b>212</b>, the carrier network will also generate CDRs related to the call. IASP <b>100</b> may pass the name and/or address of the requested party to the carrier network, along with the requested party's communication number, in the call setup signal stream typically provided by IASP <b>100</b> to the carrier network to enable call connection, via switch <b>106</b>. The name and/or address may also be provided to the carrier network by IASP <b>100</b>, via an Internet Protocol Detail Record (“IPDR”), sent via database network <b>118</b>, which the carrier network can correlate with the CDRs it generates. For example, the IPDR and CDRs generated by the carrier network may be correlated through the ANI of the customer and the time and date of the call and/or the call sequence number assigned to that communication. Alternatively, the carrier network may acquire the name and/or address of the party to whom the call is being connected by searching a database, as discussed below.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">As mentioned above, the customer may be connected back to the information assistance service system in accordance with the Starback® Service offered by the assignee of the present invention and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,092, for example, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated by reference herein. CDRs would typically be generated to document the connection back to the system. If the customer requests a new search for a communications number associated with a third party, CDRs may be generated including an indicator associated with the third party, such as a name and/or address of the third party, by repeating the steps of method <b>200</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of a CDR <b>400</b> that may be generated by IASP <b>100</b> to document an information assistance search during an information assistance call. The CDR may include multiple fields describing an information assistance communication. Specifically, EVENT<sub>—</sub>MONITOR<sub>—</sub>ID field <b>402</b> contains a sequence of alphanumeric characters uniquely identifying CDR <b>400</b>. SUBSCRIBER<sub>—</sub>MDN field <b>404</b> identifies the telephone number of the customer who made the information assistance call, i.e., the automatic number identification (ANI). IN<sub>—</sub>SPAN field <b>406</b> identifies the T1 span transporting the incoming communication of the information assistance call.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">EVENT<sub>—</sub>CLASS<sub>—</sub>ID field <b>408</b> is an optional field that may be used to identify a class of an event where CDRs are generated for multiple events, as described in application Ser. No. 09/777,061, discussed above. For example, the value “<b>30</b>” in field <b>211</b> in this instance, corresponds to a SEARCHES class. Other values for field <b>211</b> may correspond, e.g., to CALL PROCESSING, VALUE ADDED SERVICE and LOCAL SERVICES classes. Another field, here EVENT<sub>—</sub>TYPE<sub>—</sub>ID field <b>410</b>, specifies one of the event types within the class identified by the value in field <b>408</b>. For example, the value “<b>105</b>” in field <b>410</b> in this instance, corresponds to a search for a number of a requested party event within the SEARCHES class. Similarly, other values for field <b>410</b> correspond to different types of events in an identified class.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">CDR<sub>—</sub>CALL<sub>—</sub>SEQ<sub>—</sub>NMBR field <b>412</b> contains a sequence number identifying the information assistance call in question. If multiple event records are generated in the same information assistance communication to document different events taking place during the communication, as described in application Ser. No. 09/777,061, for example, they would share the same value in field <b>412</b>. In that way, billing compiler <b>34</b> may identify and compile event records related to the same communication, as discussed above. Sequence numbers are generated and assigned by switch host computer <b>107</b>, when the information assistance call is initially received by service switch <b>106</b>. Host computer <b>107</b> then transmits the sequence number to switch <b>106</b>, and any other component in IASP <b>100</b> that may generate an event record. For example, the sequence number for a call may be transmitted to operator terminal <b>114</b>, voice response unit <b>122</b> and database server <b>120</b> to be incorporated in any CDR they generate, for that particular call.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, NAME field <b>414</b> contains a name of a requested party. As discussed above, terminal <b>114</b>, database server <b>120</b>, VRU <b>122</b> and/or switch host computer <b>107</b> may generate a CDR and populate NAME field <b>414</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">IN<sub>—</sub>CHANNEL field <b>416</b> identifies the channel (within the T1 span identified by IN<sub>—</sub>SPAN field <b>406</b> described above), which the incoming communication of the information assistance call traverses. OUT<sub>—</sub>SPAN field <b>418</b> identifies the T1 span transporting the outgoing communication of the information assistance call, if any. OUT<sub>—</sub>CHANNEL field <b>420</b> identifies the channel (within the T1 span identified by field <b>418</b>) which the outgoing communication of the information assistance call traverses, if the communication is connected to the requested party's communications number, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">An optional ADDRESS field <b>422</b> may contain the address of the requested party. CITY field <b>424</b> contains the name of the city, such as New York, in which the requested party is located. STATE field <b>426</b> contains the name of the state in which the requested party is located. CARRIER<sub>—</sub>ID field <b>428</b> identifies the network carrier used to connect the call. For example, the value “<b>79</b>” in field <b>424</b> identifies AT&amp;T Corp. as the carrier in this instance. DATA<sub>—</sub>SOURCE<sub>—</sub>ID field <b>430</b> identifies the component of IASP <b>100</b> generating record <b>400</b>. EVENT<sub>—</sub>START<sub>—</sub>TIME field <b>432</b> indicates the start time of the communication event in question. It should be noted that the value in field <b>432</b> corresponds to a UNIX “epoch” time, i.e., the number of seconds elapsed from Jan. 1, 1970. Similarly, EVENT<sub>—</sub>END<sub>—</sub>TIME field <b>434</b> indicates the end time of the event in question. Thus, with such event start and end times, the duration of the event in question can be determined, which may be used in computing charges for that call. OPERATOR<sub>—</sub>LOGIN<sub>—</sub>ID field <b>436</b> identifies the operator handling the event. The REQUESTED<sub>—</sub>PARTY'S<sub>—</sub>NUMBER field <b>438</b> may contain the retrieved number of the requested party.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">Records of events which occurred in a call may be correlated by the same sequence identification number, such as CDR<sub>—</sub>CALL<sub>—</sub>SEQ<sub>—</sub>NMBR field <b>412</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, identifying the call. Each information assistance call is associated with customer information, such as ANI or SUBSCRIBER<sub>—</sub>MDN field <b>404</b> information as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and/or a customer identification number assigned by the carrier.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">Other fields, different fields and fewer fields may be provided in CDR <b>400</b>, as desired or needed by the communications system.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">CDR <b>400</b> includes all information necessary for computation of charges for each call, so that bill processing may be readily performed. An additional field or fields may be provided in the bill for containing the requested party's name and/or address, or other such indicator. A bill may be readily formatted to provide such a field by CDR server <b>36</b>, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">IASP <b>100</b> may readily insert a terminating party's name into a CDR, such as CDR <b>400</b>, since the requested party's name is provided by the customer. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of a system enabling a telephone carrier network, such as Verizon Communications, which also generates CDRs to document events in processing communications between parties, to identify and convey an indicator of the called party, such as the called party's name and/or address, into a CDR during processing of a communication, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. In that way, telephone bills itemizing calls made through the carrier may also include the called party's name in the bill.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">Carrier network <b>502</b> includes carrier switch <b>504</b> and control device <b>506</b> with memory <b>506</b> <i>a</i>. Control device <b>506</b> may be a computer or processor, for example. Carrier switch <b>504</b> is connected through a data connection <b>508</b> to DIP database system <b>510</b>, which provides a name and/or address of a party corresponding to a given communications number, upon request. DIP database system <b>510</b> includes an interface <b>512</b>, an engine <b>514</b> with memory <b>514</b> <i>a </i>and a database <b>516</b>. DIP database system <b>510</b> may be part of the carrier network <b>502</b> or may be a third party system.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">Database <b>516</b> correlates communications numbers, such as phone numbers, with the names of party's associated with respective numbers, and their addresses. It may be a directory assistance database, for example. While a directory assistance database is typically adapted to be searched for a communications number associated with a given name, database <b>516</b> may already be adapted to, or may readily be adapted to, be searched for a name associated with a communications number (“reverse search”). Requests for a name and/or address associated with a communications number are received by interface <b>512</b> and conveyed to engine <b>514</b>, where the name and address are stored in memory <b>514</b> <i>a</i>. Engine <b>514</b> searches database <b>516</b> for a name and/or address associated with the number. Engine <b>514</b> may be a processor, computer or server, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">Identified names and/or addresses are provided from DIP database <b>516</b> to engine <b>514</b>, which stores the indicator in memory <b>514</b> <i>a </i>and provides the indicator to carrier switch <b>504</b> via interface <b>512</b> and data connection <b>508</b>. The indicator may be stored in memory <b>506</b> <i>a</i>, for example. Carrier switch <b>504</b> typically generates an event record, such as a CDR, under the control of control device <b>506</b>. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, the party's name and/or address stored in memory <b>506</b> <i>a </i>is copied into an appropriate field in the CDR.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">This process preferably takes place as carrier switch <b>504</b> connects the calling party to the communications number of the called party. The CDR in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be readily modified by eliminating inapplicable fields and adding new fields for use as a CDR in a carrier network system.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">Billing platform <b>518</b> is coupled to originating switch <b>504</b>. Billing platform <b>514</b>, which may have the same configuration as billing platform <b>30</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, collects, stores and compiles CDRs and generates bills based on the CDRs, as discussed above. Billing platform <b>518</b> may be part of carrier network <b>502</b> or may be part of a third party contracted to do billing for the carrier, as is known in the art. Switch <b>504</b> sends the CDR to billing platform <b>518</b> after the call is connected.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">A method in accordance with this embodiment of the invention will now be described with respect to the flowchart <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0089">After carrier network <b>502</b> receives a communication, such as a telephone call, processing of a connection between the calling party and the called party is initiated in step <b>602</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">As the connection is being processed, a search is conducted for the called party's name and/or address, in step <b>604</b>. For example, switch <b>504</b> may provide the communications number of the called party to a search engine, such as engine <b>514</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, through an interface <b>512</b>. The communications number may be a DNIS derived from the call setup signals, for example. Engine <b>514</b> searches database <b>516</b> for a party's name and/or address associated with the communications number of the called party. If the party's name and/or address is found, either or both are provided to switch <b>504</b> through engine <b>514</b> and interface <b>512</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">The called party's name and/or address is then inserted into a CDR, in step <b>606</b>. For example, switch <b>504</b> may insert the name into a name field of a CDR generated by the switch for that communication and insert the address into the address-related fields <b>422</b>, <b>424</b>, <b>426</b>, under the control of control device <b>506</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">Processing of the communication is completed and the call is connected in step <b>608</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">After the call is connected, the CDR is sent to a billing platform, such as billing platform <b>518</b>, in step <b>610</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">As mentioned above, database <b>516</b> may be an information assistance database, adapted to retrieve party's names and/or addresses based on communications numbers. DIP database system <b>510</b> may therefore be part of an information assistance service system, such as part of IASP <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In that case, engine <b>514</b> may be database server <b>120</b> and database <b>516</b> may be directory assistance database <b>121</b>. An interface (not shown) may be provided for the carrier network <b>502</b> to access database server <b>120</b>. The method of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>a </i>may be implemented if the database system <b>510</b> is part of the carrier, part of the IASP <b>100</b> or part of another third party.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">Bill processing may be readily performed, including insertion of a terminating party's name, with the CDR, as discussed above.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">Another method in accordance with another embodiment of the invention is explained with respect to flowchart <b>650</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0097">In accordance with this embodiment, signals are received to establish a communication between a first communications device of a first party and a second communications device of a second party, in step <b>652</b>. For example, call set-up signals may be received from the first communications device of the first party, who is initiating a call to a second communications device of a second party.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">The communications number of the second communications device is derived in step <b>654</b>. The communications number may be a DNIS in the call set-up signals, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">The derived communications number is submitted to a database to determine the second party's name and/or address, in step <b>656</b>. The database may correlate communications numbers with respective parties' names and addresses. The database may be a directory assistance database that is part of a carrier network <b>502</b>, part of an IASP <b>100</b> of an information assistance service system <b>10</b> or a database system <b>510</b> of another third party.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">If a name and/or address is retrieved from the database, it is inserted into a CDR or other such event record, in step <b>658</b>. The name may be stored in memory <b>506</b> <i>a </i>and copied into the CDR by carrier switch <b>504</b> under control of control device <b>506</b> or by control device <b>506</b> itself.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">The CDR is then sent to a billing platform, such as billing platform <b>518</b>, in step <b>660</b>. This method may take place while the communication connection is being established.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">IASPs <b>21</b> through <b>27</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be configured differently than the IASP <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an alternative IASP <b>700</b>. Components common to IASC <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are commonly numbered. In IASP <b>700</b>, call interface <b>702</b> is not connected to servicing platform <b>104</b>, as in IASP <b>200</b>. Instead, the functionality of servicing platform <b>104</b> principally is carried out in carrier network <b>704</b>. Control device <b>706</b> in network <b>704</b> performs similar functions as switch host computer <b>124</b>, and interface/carrier switch <b>708</b> performs not only its conventional carrier switching functions, but also those of servicing switch <b>120</b> described above, under control of control device <b>706</b>. Control device <b>706</b> may include memory <b>707</b>. Carrier switch <b>708</b> generates CDRs to document events conducted by carrier network <b>704</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">In IASP <b>700</b>, a communication, such as an information assistance call, is recognized by control device <b>706</b> when it is routed through carrier switch <b>708</b>. Device <b>706</b> causes the communication to be connected through one of pre-designated direct inward dial (DID) connections <b>710</b> to provider <b>700</b>. Control device <b>706</b> may also be connected to IASP <b>700</b> via an Internet connection <b>712</b>. The communication is received by call interface <b>702</b> therein. Interface <b>702</b>, coupled to operator telephones <b>112</b> and coupled to operator terminals <b>114</b> via data network <b>118</b>, includes the aforementioned ACD logic for distributing the call to an operator at one of telephones in a conventional manner. Requests for information assistance are handled in the same manner as described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">In IASP <b>700</b>, a requested party's name may be inserted into a CDR in a variety of manners. Operator terminal <b>114</b>, VRU <b>122</b> and/or database server <b>120</b>, which may each have associated memory as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and not shown in this view, may generate a CDR and insert the requested party's name into a field of the CDR, as described above. The method of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be implemented, for example. Those CDRs may be correlated with CDRs generated by carrier network <b>704</b>, as discussed above.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">The name and/or address or other such indicator of a requested party may also be provided by IASP <b>700</b> to carrier network <b>704</b> via a data connection, such as Internet connection <b>712</b>. Control device <b>706</b> may store the indicator in memory <b>707</b> and copy the requested party's name into the CDR generated by carrier switch <b>708</b>, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">In another alternative, carrier switch <b>708</b> may be coupled to database server <b>120</b> though an interface <b>718</b>, in a similar manner as carrier switch <b>504</b> is coupled to interface <b>512</b> in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this case, the methods of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>may be implemented.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">The communications systems described above may be implemented with in-band, feature group D (FGD) type signaling, SS7 out-of-band signaling or other signaling for communications between switches (including carrier switches). Where SS7 out-of-band signaling is used, the communications systems receive the call set-up signals and call progress information (busy, ring-no-answer, number unavailable, answer supervision, etc.) coming from an SS7 signaling link, separate from the voice trunk.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">While information assistance service system <b>10</b> and IASP <b>100</b> are accessed via a telephone network in the embodiments described above, it is understood that system <b>10</b> and IASP <b>100</b> may be accessed via other types of networks, such as the Internet or a WAN. In the case of the Internet, the ANI may be replaced by a URL, using conventional networking and computer equipment.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">The communications systems and their components are disclosed herein in a form in which various functions are performed by discrete functional blocks. However, any one or more of these functions could equally well be embodied in an arrangement in which the functions of any one or more of those blocks or indeed, all of the functions thereof, are realized, for example, by one or more appropriately programmed processors. In addition, while parties' names are stored in different memory devices associated with different components of the IASP <b>100</b>, party's names may be stored in different locations in the same memory device.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">The foregoing merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise numerous other arrangements that embody the principles of the invention and are thus within the spirit and scope of the invention, which is defined by the claims, below.</p>
