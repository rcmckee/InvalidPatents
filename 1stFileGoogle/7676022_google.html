The system includes an X-ray source and a digital imaging device capable of “real time” frame mode output. The source and imaging device are mounted in a mechanical manipulator defining the trajectory of a predetermined image layer. The imaging device communicates with a processor that generates a frames memory from which an image reconstruction mechanism composes the final images. For “real time” imaging, the frames memory is a fast data storage system such as RAM. The processing unit executes the reconstruction algorithms, allowing the system to selectively generate dental panoramic X-ray images, dental transverse x-ray images and dental tomosynthetic 3D images.</div>

<p num="p-0002">The present application claims the benefit of prior filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/277,530 filed 27 Mar. 2006, which claimed the benefit of prior filed U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/677,020 filed 2 May 2005, which are incorporated herein by reference, and to which the present application is a continuation-in-part U.S. national utility patent application.</p>
  <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention is in the field of apparatuses and corresponding processes involving the use of radiation within the X-ray spectrum with specific features characteristic of X-ray applications. More specifically, the present invention relates to digital dental panoramic imaging apparatuses producing a digital image of a curved dental structure, wherein a digital image of all teeth on upper and/or lower jaws is formed in a single digital image.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Dental panoramic X-ray imaging is a well-known dental radiographic procedure. Its purpose is to produce an X-ray image of the entire jaw for diagnosis as opposed to a partial image such as obtained by intra-oral X-ray imaging. Other extra-oral dental X-ray imaging systems include cone beam dental computed tomography (CT) system for 3-D tomosynthetic volumetric reconstruction and transverse slicing. Regular panoramic imaging is used mostly from general purpose orthodontics, while 3-D imaging and transverse slicing may be used more often for dental implantation.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Dental panoramic X-ray imaging units, cone beam units and transverse slicing units, a.k.a. orthopantomographs (OPGs) or dental CT's, are available with analog film were suitable and with digital sensors (in case of cone beam CT). Digital OPGs currently available in the market utilize sensors based on CCDs coupled to a phosphor or scintillator, and operate in a Time Delay Integration Mode (TDI), or flat panels utilizing a-Si (amorphous silicon) TFT arrays (Thin Film Transistor) with again a scintillator on the top. Both CCD's and TFT flat panels used convert x-rays to light and then light is converted to an electronic signal inside the CCD or TFT. This equipment and especially the cone beam CT and transverse slicing equipment which produce multiple frames, these systems are not fast enough for continuous exposure. Consequently, real time viewing is not possible. A fully equipped dental office needs to have several types of so called “intra-oral” sensors to complete the range of functionalities needed to cover general maxillofacial examinations, fillings and cavities, orthodontics, implantology and surgery. As can be appreciated, this is a cost burden that probably only large clinics can afford.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">An orthopantomograph is made up of four functional units: an X-ray generator; an imaging device; a mechanical manipulator; and a user control panel. The purpose of the X-ray generator is to create the x-rays that penetrate the head of the patient and arrive at the imaging device. The X-ray generator or source is able to generate x-rays with different spectra by varying the high voltage level and with differing intensity by varying the current. The imaging device detects and converts the x-rays incident on it into an image. The mechanical manipulator displaces both the imaging device and the X-ray generator in such a way that a proper panoramic image of the plane-of-interest is formed. The user control panel or the user interface, is used to control different settings of the OPG or to initiate and control an X-ray exposure event.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Currently digital imaging devices accomplish their purpose through: absorption by traditional films, or by digital two-stage indirect conversion (using a CCD with a scintillator). Linear arrays of CCD's are used in OPG's but flat panels based on TFT or image intensifiers are used in cone beam dental CT. A typical cone beam dental CT system does not differ in any substantial way from the OPG system, except that the X-ray beam is cone shaped rather than fan shaped. Additionally the cone beam systems require that the X-ray scan be performed for longer times and in step fashion (i.e., not continuously) because Image Intesifiers (IIs) or TFT panels are too slow and lack sensitivity.</p>
  <p num="h-0003">Dental Panoramic, Dental Transverse and Dental 3-D X-Ray Imaging</p>
  <p num="p-0008">In dental panoramic X-ray imaging, the image is captured during a process in which both the X-ray generator and the imaging device move around the patient's head according to a predetermined geometric path and speed profile. The movement is synchronized in such a way that an image of the pre-determined layer of interest is formed according to the predetermined geometry and speed profile. Because of the shape of the human jaw, this layer is a non-planar structure. It in fact varies with the morphology of each individual's jaw. To simplify the procedure while still maintaining high resolution, a standard shape is used that is applied to all human males, females, and children of certain ages, is used. The exact shape of the layer-of-interest depends on the dental procedure in question; the predetermined geometric path of the source and detector (optionally varying depending on the patient type); and the predetermined speed profile. The layer can usually be adjusted by selecting a different pre-determined, preset program in the OPG by changing the path of movement and/or also the speed profile. Different programs can alter the general parameters of the profile to match the patient (again, e.g., whether child or adult) or to only image a part of the full profile (i.e., front teeth, left/right side etc.). But in each case when a new panoramic layer is needed a new exposure needs to be taken, which means additional radiation to the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">The movement of the X-ray generator and the imaging device is traditionally synchronized so that the imaging device surface normal is perpendicular to the layer-of-interest. In this way the formed image is distorted as little as possible. A disadvantage of this approach is that the movement trajectory is quite complex. To achieve this motion, multiple motors are required (i.e. degrees of freedom) which also complicates the control electronics and algorithms, thus leading to higher cost. There are some imaging modalities in which the direction of radiation is intentionally not perpendicular to the surface normal, but the same drawbacks and advantages apply. In addition, one of the most severe issues experienced today in clinical applications of dental panoramic imaging is that the patient (object) does or cannot necessarily remain motionless for the whole duration of the scan (typically lasting 5 to 30 seconds). Even a small misalignment of the patient can result in that the part of the imaged layer being blurred or out of focus. In addition to panoramic images, a dentist may wish to create a transverse slice image of the patient's jaw. In transverse imaging, the layer-of-interest is perpendicular to the panoramic layer.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">The existing commercially available, extra-oral (including, for example, panoramic and transverse) imaging solutions are either based on elongated (i.e. with an aspect ratio—length “m” divided by width“n”—of m/n=5 or more) time-delayed integration CCD sensors (not producing multiple frames) or on large-area 2D detectors with a computed tomography system backend where m/n is substantially equal to 1 (which, however, do produce multiple frames). The large-area 2D detectors are most often TFT panels and are particularly expensive because of the m/n.apprxeq.1 aspect ratio (approximately equal to one). The elongated detectors, which use a CCD coupled with a scintillator, apply the time-delayed integration (TDI) principle to form the image of the layer of interest. Time-Delay Integration is a method of synchronizing the shifting of the image signal captured in the pixel with the movement of the object image across the face of the CCD. This permits integration of more signal, increasing sensitivity, reducing noise and reducing image blur. According to this method, the integrated charges are clocked inside the detector logic (CCD) in the direction of the movement. Thus, at a given integration period t<sub>i</sub>, the charge for a fixed object volume v is integrated to a pixel p<sub>n</sub>. The object is moved so that the image of the plane-of-interest is moved (taking the magnification factor into account) exactly a pixel's width. After the integration period, the charges are transferred in such a way that if the image of the volume v is projected to pixel p<sub>i-1</sub>, the charged from pixel p<sub>i </sub>is transferred to pixel p<sub>i-1</sub>. The last pixel value in the row, which has no neighbor to which to transfer the charge, is read out and stored in the final image. In this way, the apparent integration time of an image pixel is the integration period multiplied by the width of the imaging device in pixels.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">With the TDI principle, the clocking of the charges must be synchronized so that the apparent speed of the layer-of-interest in the imaging devices active in an integration period must be exactly the width of the pixel. If the speed is not matched, the image will appear blurred. A 2D flat image is formed from a single scan using an imaging device operating in the TDI mode. Multiple panoramic layers, transverse slicing or 3D imaging is not possible because only a single projection is saved.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">In a dental cone beam computed tomography system (3-D imaging), multiple, non-TDI exposures are taken with a 2D area detector where m substantially equals n (i.e. within 20%). The movement is stopped before the exposure and the X-ray source is only active during this stationary period. The movement is continued after the exposure. In this manner, the movement doesn't have to be synchronized. Such systems require a higher dose to be administered to the patient and also longer examination times. The final image is formed as a layer calculated from the volumetric (3D) dataset constructed from the individual exposures or projections. The clear advantage of this method is that a full 3D volumetric dataset will be available after the procedure. However, with current solutions, the resolution of panoramic layer calculated from the 3D data is low compared to dedicated panoramic imaging systems (OPGs). Furthermore, the dose levels are much higher and maybe equally importantly the cost of such available systems is in the range of 200 kUSD-400 kUSD.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">U.S. Pat. No. 6,496,557, entitled “Two Dimensional Slot X-ray Bone Densitometry, Radiography and Tomography,” describes a process in which multiple layers are formed by a so-called shift-and-add algorithm. The process described includes a system in which the motion of the imaging device is either linear or includes a rotational component around the focal point of the X-ray source. Unfortunately, such a system cannot be used in the field of dental X-ray imaging where the layer(s) of interest run around or across the human jaw. Although such an approach may be useful in bone densitometry and in some other applications, it is in practice impossible to apply to dental panoramic or transverse imaging due to the fact that x-rays run essentially parallel to rather than across the layer-of-interest, should there be linear movement or rotation around the focal point. Additionally, the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,496,557 would have another serious limitation if an attempt were to be made to apply it in the field of dental imaging. That limitation is the most serious issue in panoramic imaging and it results in partial image blurring due to misalignment of the patient or due to patient movement. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 6,496,557 fails to address the need of a system or a procedure that is able to simultaneously perform both panoramic as well as transverse imaging. Further, this patent fails to disclose a system operable in a dental imaging environment.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">U.S. Pat. No. 5,784,429, entitled “Dental panoramic X-ray imaging apparatus,” describes a system in which multiple layers are calculated using plural tomographic images corresponding to plural tomographic planes which are arranged at predetermined intervals along the direction of the X-ray irradiation. A convolution process or a frequency process is conducted on a specific tomographic image by using image information of at least one of the tomographic images, so as to remove blur from the specific tomographic image. This patent describes a means of implementing different layers by using image intensifiers, CCD's or combinations thereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">U.S. Pat. No. 7,136,452, entitled “Radiation Imaging System and Scanning Device,” discloses the use of frame mode CdTe-CMOS detectors for creating tomographic images in several applications including dental panoramic images using a dental X-ray setup. In U.S. Pat. No. 7,136,452, Spartiotis et al. disclose that the read-out speed or frame rate must be high enough to allow the detector to move by no more than half a pixel size or preferably even less per a read-out cycle. Emphasis added. However, if a system is implemented in such a way, serious limitations can arise such as the need to transfer a disproportionately large amount of data to a computer or the like in real-time. However, '451 patent is silent on the management of data to reconstruct and display an image in real-time, during the exposure. Furthermore, Spartiotis et al. teach nothing about one of the most serious issues facing dental radiology, that of partial image blurring due to patient misalignment and how to create automatically a focused layer. In such cases, part of the image (i.e., the panoramic layer-of-interest) is blurred while another part is in focus. Spartiotis et al. merely disclose that the frame rate needs be very high to collect frames in such a case in which the detector has moved by less than half a pixel, but does not teach how to accomplish this. Unfortunately, in this case, the amount of data produced during the exposure is unnecessarily high while at the same time, no material performance benefit is gained. Additionally, Spartiotis et al. do not suggest a means by which one might combine data to gain performance benefits and to correct blurring or to produce transverse image slices or even tomosynthetic 3D images.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">Devices exist that are capable for example of performing transverse slicing or 3-D reconstructed images, but most often they require much longer X-ray scan times and non-continuous scan (ie a step by step scan). The long exposures are needed because the normally used digital imaging devices lack sensitivity and typically can “catch” only 1 out of 3 incoming x-rays. Further, non-continuous step-wise scans are necessary in the prior art because of the slow response and slow readout of the current rectangular or square flat panel TFT arrays. Higher doses and longer step-wise scans create higher risk and discomfort to the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">Additionally, the prior art does not suggest a means by which one might combine data to gain performance benefits and to correct blurring or to produce transverse image slices or even tomosynthetic 3D images. What is needed, therefore, is a system that limits the radiation doses a patient receives while maximizing the data output. Further, what is needed is a system which permits continuous fast, real-time X-ray scans, and a system and method of combining data from a single exposure to, not only reconstruct a panoramic layer of interest, but to also be able to correct part of the image that is blurred and furthermore produce transverse image slices and 3D images. Still further needed is a system that is capable of correcting blurring and which can produce transverse image slices or tomosynthetic 3D image.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0018">The present invention is an extra-oral dental X-ray digital imaging system. The present system produces digital panoramic extra-oral dental X-ray images, including multi-layer dental panoramic and transverse X-ray images. The system includes an X-ray source, a digital imaging device having a frame mode output capable of a high frame rate, a mechanical manipulator having at least one rotation axis located in a position other that the focal point of the X-ray source and means of detecting the camera position in 1D, 2D or 3D depending of the complexity of the trajectory and means of reconstructing the final images out of the stored frames. Also included are a real time storage system such as RAM, a hard drive or a drive array able to store all the frames captured during an exposure, and a digital processing unit interconnected in operational arrangement with the other components and capable of executing the reconstruction algorithm. The present system is adapted to produce selectively two or more of the following: 1) a predetermined dental panoramic layer image 2) at least part of a non predetermined dental panoramic layer image 3) transverse slice to a selected part of a dental panoramic layer image 4) 3-D reconstruction of a volume corresponding to some part of a dental panoramic layer, all from image data from a single exposure.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">In particular, the system combines a fast readout with a memory of comparable speed, i.e., a memory which stores and accesses information substantially in any order and in which all storage locations are substantially equally accessible. Such a memory has sufficient speed for storing the multiple frames concurrently with the exposure in a manner which permits retrieval and display in real time. Preferably such system should employ an X-ray imaging device having an aspect ratio of m/n&gt;1.2 where m is the long dimension and n is the short dimension of the active area of the imaging device. In accomplishing its advantages, the present system causes substantially no greater radiation exposure than the dose used in a regular dental panoramic exposure, while performing the X-ray scan to collect such data in a continuous movement. Additionally, the detector device produces a variety of formats of panoramic images from a high-speed, X-ray digital imaging device. In a further advantage, the present system and method combines data from a single exposure to not only reconstruct a panoramic layer of interest but to also be able to correct part of the image that is blurred and furthermore produce transverse image slices and 3D images.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0036">Referring now to the drawings, the details of preferred embodiments of the present invention are graphically and schematically illustrated. Like elements in the drawings are represented by like numbers, and any similar elements are represented by like numbers with a different lower case letter suffix.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the system <b>10</b> of the invention uses a frame mode CdTe-CMOS detectors for creating tomographic images including dental panoramic images using a dental X-ray setup. In this application, the read-out speed or frame rate need only be high enough to allow the detector to move by more than half a pixel size and preferably less a full pixel read-out cycle. However, serious limitations can arise such as the need to transfer a disproportionately large amount of data to a computer or the like in real-time. Therefore, it is beneficial to manage data in order to reconstruct and display an image in real-time, during the exposure.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">The dental X-ray imaging system <b>10</b> produces panoramic images <b>12</b> for use in dental diagnosis and treatment. The system <b>10</b>, using data generated from a single exposure, selectively produces at least two of the following: 1) a predetermined dental panoramic layer image 2) at least part of another dental panoramic layer(s) 3) transverse slice to a selected part of a dental panoramic layer image 4) 3-D reconstruction of a volume corresponding to some part of a dental panoramic layer.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">The system <b>10</b> preferably employs a detector having an aspect ratio of its long m to short n dimensions in its “active area” with an m/n ratio greater than 1.5. The “active area” is the portion of the X-ray imaging device that is sensitive to detecting X-ray flux. This is advantageous because such a detector is much more economical and practical than a full square area detector. Although digital detector prices are dropping, it is still the case that a full field digital imaging device having sufficient resolution is much more expensive than an elongated imaging device. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention uses a digital imaging device having detector substrate made of a Cadmium and Telluride composition, such as CdTe or CdZnTe (Cadmium Zinc Telluride). Additionally, it is preferred that the detector is bump-bonded to a readout substrate, e.g., a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). CdTe and CdZnTe detectors bump-bonded to CMOS ASIC are preferred as suitably fast X-ray imaging devices, due to their high density and absorption efficiency, readout speed and resolution.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">The dental X-ray imaging system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention includes an X-ray source <b>16</b> for generating the radiation to be detected by the digital imaging device <b>14</b>. The digital imaging device <b>14</b> has a frame mode output with a sufficiently high frame rate as set forth below. A mechanical manipulator <b>20</b> mounts hardware of the source <b>16</b> and imaging device <b>14</b>. The mechanical manipulator has at least one rotation axis located in a position other that the focal point of the X-ray source, and includes an alignment estimator <b>24</b>. A reconstruction algorithm <b>26</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>8</b> <i>c</i>) reconstructs at least two final digital imaging device <b>14</b> images out of the same set of stored frames <b>40</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> <i>b</i>) from a single exposure. A storage system <b>17</b> is used to temporarily storing all the data in effectively real time, and a processing unit <b>22</b> such as a personal computer, is used to control certain processes of the system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">The X-ray source <b>16</b> is a radiation source such as an X-ray generator or a radionuclide. The X-ray source <b>16</b> irradiates an object <b>19</b> to be imaged. The X-ray imaging device <b>14</b> is adapted to produce multiple frames <b>40</b> during at least part of the exposure/irradiation period. The mechanical manipulator <b>20</b> controls the movement of the X-ray source <b>16</b> and the imaging device <b>14</b> about at least one rotation axis along a spline, which may of course, be a circular or non-circular trajectory. The axis is located somewhere between the X-ray source focal point and the X-ray imaging device. The reconstruction algorithm <b>26</b> uses the multiple frames <b>40</b> to compose a panoramic image of a layer of the object under observation, the image having a focus depth which is different in at least some part of the panoramic image from the focus depth corresponding to a predetermined panoramic image.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">The present invention is a scanning X-ray imaging system <b>10</b> wherein the X-ray source <b>16</b> is adapted for transmitting X-rays and exposing an object position to the x-rays. The object position <b>70</b> is a location that an object to be imaged is position for exposure to the X-rays, and is disposed between the X-ray source <b>16</b> and the X-ray imaging device <b>14</b>. The combination of the X-ray source <b>16</b> and the imaging device <b>14</b> track along a path defined within the object position <b>70</b> over the course of an exposure cycle. This defined path corresponds to the pre-determined image layer speed profile. The scanning X-ray imaging device <b>14</b> is adapted for receiving transmitted X-rays and for producing multiple image frames during at least part of the exposure cycle. As the image frames <b>40</b> are produced, they are held/stored as corrected raw pixel signal data. If real time imaging is desired, the image frame data are held in a “fast” storage medium <b>17</b>, otherwise they are held in another adequate storage medium.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">Individual frames and groups of frames can be selectively recalled from the held/stored image frames <b>40</b>. A selectable portion of the image frames <b>40</b> are selectable for use by a means that automatically reconstructs a focused tomographic image from two or more image layer speed profiles. An algorithm is used as the means that reconstructs a focused tomographic image. The user selects a region of interest (e.g., of the predetermined layer panoramic image) that it is desired to refocus. The algorithm accomplishes automatic refocusing by optimizing the image sharpness of the selected region of interest by doing a sharpness comparison between appropriate multiple frames with different speed profiles, which are otherwise analogous to the region of interest and replacing the region in the image with the sharper analogous region.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">The digital imaging device has active area dimensions m×n, wherein m is the long dimension <b>530</b> and n is the short dimension <b>510</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>a</i>) such that m/n&gt;1.5 thus it has an elongated shape and is able to readout the frames <b>40</b> at 50 fps (frames per second) or more preferably 100 fps and even more preferably 300 fps or more. The m/n&gt;1.5 geometry helps keep the costs of such a device down and indeed costs can be much less that a full field active area imaging device. This is particularly true where the imaging device is a CdTe-CMOS <b>560</b> or CdZnTe-CMOS imaging device.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">Furthermore, the mechanical manipulator's X-ray source arm <b>20</b> and digital imaging device <b>14</b> move in a continuous scan movement (not necessarily constant) for the duration of the useful part of the scan, i.e. the part of the scan that x-rays are emitted from the X-ray source <b>16</b> as needed to image substantially the whole jaw <b>19</b>. The duration of the scan and the amount of x-rays emitted are comparable to the radiation dose required in a regular dental panoramic X-ray scan. The final images can be selected from a group of predetermined panoramic layer images <b>99</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), other panoramic layers images (or at least part thereof <b>98</b>), transverse slicing images, or 3-D images.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">A real time storage device <b>17</b> such as RAM <b>18</b> (or a similarly fast data storage &amp; access device) is used to store-and-hold all the frames <b>40</b> captured during an exposure. A digital processing unit <b>22</b> (for example, a typical computer CPU) is in electronic communication with the real time storage device <b>17</b> and executes the reconstruction algorithm using the frames <b>40</b> (corrected raw pixel array signal data) held on the storage device <b>17</b>. The system <b>10</b> selectively produces dental panoramic X-ray images <b>12</b> or parts thereof, dental transverse X-ray images <b>224</b> and dental tomosynthetic 3D images from a frame stream produced by the high-speed, X-ray digital imaging device.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">The imaging device <b>14</b> is a digital imaging device is a “frame mode” output device (as opposed to a “line” output device), outputting corrected raw frame data in frame mode output with a sufficient fast frame rate. This means that the imaging device is disposed to move substantially continuously relative to the object being scanned, and that the individually addressable imaging cell output values are readout at time intervals substantially corresponding to a point on the object image traversing between half and the full distance w of a detector pixel in the scanning direction during a scan. That is, that on average, frame shift intervals are more than half a pixel width (i.e., w/2=&gt;0.5) in the direction of the scan, but less than a full pixel width s, averaged over all the frames in an exposure.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">A working embodiment of the present imaging device <b>14</b> is of the type shown in the photo in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>a</i>. The elongated active area <b>520</b> of the imaging device comprised six CMOS/detector hybrids. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>b </i>schematically illustrates such a CMOS/detector hybrid. The preferred detector substrate <b>620</b> illustrated comprised a Cadmium and Telluride composition, such as CdTe and CdZnTe, which absorbs the X-rays with extreme sensitivity and converts them directly to an electronic charge. The CMOS readout substrate <b>630</b> was in electrical communication with the detector substrate <b>620</b>, by means of low temperature lead free solder bumps <b>610</b> (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,933,505). The individual CMOS/detector hybrids are connected electrically to the mother board <b>560</b> by means of wire bonding of pads <b>640</b> onto the corresponding pads of the mother board. Beneath the mother board <b>560</b> there is situated a readout or interface board <b>570</b> for controlling the mother board and producing a digital video signal which is readout via connector <b>550</b>. Connector <b>550</b> can be of the camera link type protocol which is a commercially available readout protocol. Nevertheless, the readout can also happen through a variety of other readout protocols such as USB 2.0, firewire or gigabit Ethernet. The interface board also contains a power supply connector <b>540</b> which provides all the necessary supply voltages to the boards as well as High Voltage (“HV”) to the CdTe detectors. A frame mode imaging device <b>14</b> in accordance with the invention produces independent image frames <b>40</b> by means of outputting sequentially or in random access, pixel values every so often and usually in predetermined time intervals.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">A frame <b>40</b> is understood to be a two dimensional spatial representation of pixel values <b>55</b>, each pixel value <b>55</b> corresponding to the output from a physical pixel <b>53</b> in the imaging device or in some cases each pixel value <b>55</b> can correspond to a combination of output values from the imaging device physical pixels <b>53</b>. The conversion of the output signal of an image device pixel <b>53</b> to its corresponding frame pixel value <b>55</b> can take place inside the imaging device or externally, for example inside the computer <b>22</b>. The imaging device <b>14</b> is able to produce many individual frames <b>40</b> during the X-ray scan, with very high sensitivity. In a regular CCD based panoramic examination, the CCD works in the Time Delay Integration mode (TDI) which is well-known in the field. The output from a CCD imaging device is image lines <b>110</b> as depicted schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> <i>a</i>. For the duration of the scan, the CCD outputs image lines <b>110</b> and at the end of the scan only one panoramic image layer <b>12</b> is reconstructed corresponding to a predetermined layer depending on the mechanical geometry of the panoramic unit and the speed profile and the positioning of the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">On the other hand, the imaging device <b>14</b> of the type described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>operates in frame output mode, with sufficient speed and excellent sensitivity to match the speed. The imaging device implemented by the applicant operates at frame rates of 50 fps to 300 fps or more depending on the mechanical scanning speed of the X-ray source. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> <i>b</i>, during the X-ray scan the output from the imaging device are frames <b>40</b> rather than lines, such frames <b>40</b> overlapping during the scan and providing the necessary data redundancy needed to reconstruct not only one but several dental panoramic layers, or parts of layers, transverse slicing and even 3-D tomosynthetic image reconstruction of teeth. The imaging device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>a </i>can also provide just raw independent pixel values and in this case, the frames <b>40</b> may be reconstructed then in the personal computer by rearranging the pixel values to frames.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">The mechanical manipulator <b>20</b> has at least one rotation axis <b>34</b> located in a position other that the focal point <b>36</b> of the X-ray source. The alignment estimator <b>24</b> detects the camera position in 1D, 2D or 3D depending on the complexity of the trajectory. The panoramic reconstruction process <b>26</b> uses an algorithm to reconstruct the final images <b>12</b> out of the stored frames <b>40</b>. The storage system <b>17</b> is capable of storing the frames <b>40</b> in real time in order to avoid frame loss and is therefore essentially a real time storage system such as RAM <b>18</b>, or very fast hard drive or an drive array capable of transferring stored data at 10 MB/sec or faster and therefore able to store all the frames <b>40</b> captured during an exposure while permitting real time retrieval of such data. In a preferred embodiment, RAM <b>18</b> having a 50 MB/sec retrieval rate is a Kingston 400 MHz 2 GB DDR (model number KHX 3200AK2/2G). This RAM has a clock speed of 400 MHz and with every clock pulse it is able to store 8 bits. Models with RAM speeds of 5 GB/sec or more are available. These storage means may be located in the computer <b>22</b> or located in the imaging device <b>14</b> or at some other location. Storing frames <b>40</b> in real time here means with a time delay of not more than few seconds and preferably few milliseconds and even more preferably few microseconds. The processing unit <b>32</b> is a digital processing unit such as a personal computer <b>22</b>, micro controller, FPGA or DSP, (not shown) capable of executing the reconstruction algorithm <b>26</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the speed of the X-ray imaging device <b>14</b> combined with the reconstruction algorithm <b>26</b> allow formation of multiple dental X-ray images from the frames <b>40</b> of a single exposure. A single exposure refers here to a continuous measurement in which the whole layer-of-interest <b>52</b> (the layer-of-interest can be a part of the whole dental area) is exposed to radiation one or more times, but in which the apparent movement between two consecutive radiated frames <b>40</b> is never less than half the size of a pixel <b>53</b> and stays less than the full size w of the pixel <b>53</b>. This results in there being ample overlap <b>56</b> between consecutive frames <b>40</b>, but not at the expense of creating huge data sets that cannot be utilized in real time. This is particularly important in dental imaging where the user (dentist) is expecting to see an image <b>12</b> in effectively real-time and during the exposure.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">Note that “Effectively Real-Time” as used herein means that the image <b>12</b> is displayed in less than 10 seconds after the end of the exposure and more preferably less than 5 seconds, and optimally, the image is displayed effectively simultaneously during the exposure. For this to be achieved, the frame rate or time intervals between consecutive frames <b>40</b> must not be shorter than what is needed to allow the physical pixels <b>53</b> to move by at least half a pixel width-size s, but short enough to have the detector pixels <b>53</b> move less than a full pixel width size s. Regarding such imaging devices <b>14</b> as were described herein with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b</i>, capable of producing multiple frame data with the above qualities, see WO2004055550 and EP 1520300.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">The imaging device <b>14</b> and radiation source <b>16</b> of the present system <b>10</b> rotates around an axis <b>34</b> which is positioned between (but not necessarily crossing the volume of x-rays <b>35</b> from the source <b>16</b> to the imaging device <b>14</b>) the X-ray source <b>16</b> and the imaging device <b>14</b>. Furthermore, the frames <b>40</b> generated by the (CdTe-CMOS/CdZnTe-CMOS) imaging device <b>14</b> are temporarily stored in real time in a sufficiently large RAM <b>18</b>, to allow real time processing and display of a dental panoramic image <b>12</b> of a layer <b>52</b>. That is, a “reconstructed” or readable image begins to be presented (unfolds) for the viewer before the exposure cycle is fully completed. The processing of the frames <b>40</b> to produce such panoramic images <b>12</b> includes spatial (i.e. pixel) domain arithmetic.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">The difference between a normal TDI-type device (not shown) and the present imaging system <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref> <i>b </i>and <b>7</b>. A normal TDI-type device records only a single layer <b>12</b>, while the present system <b>10</b> records multiple overlapping frames <b>40</b> which can be used to calculate multiple layers (both panoramic and transverse) and limited tomosynthetic 3D structures.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b</i>, the imaging device <b>14</b> itself has an aperture <b>520</b> which is elongated (i.e., has one edge <b>530</b> which is much longer that the other edge <b>510</b>). In this particular embodiment, one edge is 0.6 cm in width and the other is 15 cm in length. The device <b>14</b> has an active area made of an array of 1500×64 pixels. The detector active area <b>520</b> is made of six CMOS/detector hybrids and combined provides the active slot <b>520</b> which has two main dimensions: m and n where m is the long dimension <b>530</b> and n is the short dimension <b>510</b>. As can be seen, m/n&gt;&gt;1. Preferably m/n&gt;1.5, and even more preferably m/n&gt;5 and even 10. In the embodiment disclosed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>a</i>, the ratio m/n was greater than 23. An important benefit of the preferred ratios achievable by the present system <b>10</b> is that: the larger the active area, the more expensive the detector is. For example, even with current mass produced flat panel TFT arrays, the price of an imaging device with m/n=1 or close to 1 is of the order $20,000 or even $30,000 USD. However, with an imaging device <b>14</b> of the present system <b>10</b>, one is able to have the functionalities of regular panoramic equipment as well as at least partly, the functionality of the very expensive transverse slicing and 3-D reconstruction dental equipment.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">The combination of the imaging device <b>14</b> and X-ray generator <b>16</b> rotate around the object position <b>70</b>, i.e., the head of the patient <b>72</b>, but the angular coverage can be less that a full circle as compared to a CT system (not shown). The position of the imaging device <b>14</b> is either recorded as a one-dimensional position counter which tells the position of the current frame <b>40</b> in the final panoramic image <b>12</b>, or it can record the full 3D position including orientation. The system <b>10</b> records the relative position of the imaging device <b>14</b> as a function of time, and thus it is possible to reconstruct a full dental image <b>12</b> from individual frames <b>40</b> stored. Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the simplest reconstruction is the one for producing a dental panoramic X-ray image <b>12</b>. In this case, the position of the current frame <b>40</b> is recorded as a coordinate <b>74</b> in the final image <b>12</b>. This coordinate <b>74</b> is then used to calculate the shift <b>76</b> required in a shift-and-add algorithm, mentioned above as the reconstruction algorithm <b>26</b> used in reconstructing the final image.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> <i>b </i>and <b>8</b> <i>c</i>, the sub-pixel shifting is accomplished by adding the pixels <b>55</b> in a frame <b>40</b> to two locations in the final image <b>12</b> multiplied by suitable weighting factors w<sub>left</sub>, w<sub>right</sub>. If the target position is x (non-integer or integer) and the position is increasing in a positive direction, then the pixel value <b>55</b> is added to positions floor(x) and ceil(x) where floor(x) refers to the largest integer smaller than x and ceil(x) refers smallest integer larger that x. The respective weighting coefficients w<sub>left</sub>, w<sub>right </sub>are x-floor(x) and ceil(x)-x. The weighting factors w<sub>left</sub>, w<sub>right </sub>can be global to a single frame <b>40</b>, or can vary from pixel to pixel to compensate for any time delays between individual pixels. This is mathematically equivalent to interpolating the frames <b>40</b> and final image <b>12</b> linearly in the horizontal direction, shifting the frame pixels in the horizontal direction by an integer amount and then down-sampling the frames <b>40</b> and the final image to the original size. The sub-pixel shifting can also be implemented using any other interpolation method, for example with bi-linear, bi-cubic or spline interpolation. The sub-pixel shift-and-add algorithm <b>26</b> is implemented to eliminate extra jaggedness of diagonal edges compared to an integer shift-and-add algorithm (i.e., only use integer part of the position <b>86</b> without any interpolation or weighing).</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> an algorithm <b>300</b> is provided which auto-focuses a panoramic layer and automatically calculating the layer-of-best-focus for dental panoramic imaging. The algorithm <b>300</b> uses the multiple frames <b>40</b> to compose a panoramic image of a layer of the object under observation, the image having a focus depth which is different in at least some part of the panoramic image from the focus depth corresponding to a predetermined panoramic image. The algorithm <b>300</b> has five steps. In a first step <b>302</b>, frame data <b>304</b> is used to reset the change in velocity ΔV of movement in the image plane compared to the change in original velocity ΔV<sub>orig</sub>. In a second step <b>306</b>, the user specifies a region of interest. In a third step <b>310</b>, the region of interest is reconstructed at the original speed V<sub>orig </sub>plus the change in velocity ΔV. In a fourth step <b>312</b>, the sharpness measure S<sub>(n) </sub>(sharpness measure S, which can either be a measure of contrast, roughness or some other measure of the image sharpness) and sharpness difference ΔS is calculated as being equal to S<sub>(n) </sub>minus S<sub>(n-1)</sub>×SM(V<sub>orig</sub>+ΔV). In a fifth step <b>314</b>, if ΔS is less than a particular limit, then the region of interest is displayed. Otherwise, calculate using a different step delta velocity ΔV and returns to step <b>310</b> and continue. The algorithm <b>300</b> can be applied globally to the whole final image <b>12</b> or locally to a given region-of-interest <b>98</b>. Therefore, a user of the system <b>10</b> (e.g., a dentist) is able to observe and initial panoramic image <b>12</b> and then select a region (portion) <b>98</b> of the image <b>12</b> where blurring may be evident, in which case, the algorithm maximizes sharpness S of the selected part of the image. The result is a complete image <b>12</b> with all parts well in focus.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">By reversing the direction in which the frames <b>40</b> are added to the final image <b>12</b>, a completely different layer <b>60</b> can be reconstructed. By using the same speed profile <b>186</b>, but reversed a direction, a mirror layer can be reconstructed. This mirror layer is on the opposite side of the patient, and in the dental panoramic imaging this equates to the area of the neck in the center part of the scan. So the invention provides a method to calculate the image of the spine. By re-projecting this image to the normal panoramic layer (by flipping the mirror image and applying suitable re-scaling function), an estimate of the blurring caused by the spine is obtained. This estimate can then be subtracted from the panoramic image <b>12</b> to decrease the effect of the spine on the image quality. As an end result, the panoramic image <b>12</b> is obtained without any potentially distracting superfluous images of the spine structure.</p>
  <heading>Example I</heading> <p num="p-0061">For typical a dental application of the present system <b>10</b>, the elongated CMOS/detector sensor had an active slot <b>520</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>a</i>) of 150 mm×6.4 mm in size. The pixel size w in the scanning direction was typically 100 um, although smaller pixel sizes are achievable (but considered as unnecessary in dental extra-oral imaging). The exposure scan time was 5 to 30 seconds, with a frame rate of 200 to 300 fps (frames per second). The sensor moves about half a pixel size to less than one full pixel size w between consecutive frames <b>40</b>. At that rate, the output frame data <b>304</b> can reach more than 750 MB for the entire scan which is a large data set, but still is quite manageable. It is essential therefore that the frame rate not be too high as this would not add anything to the image resolution and would only make data transfer and processing difficult, if not impossible, in real-time.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">A video or frame grabber, based on a technology such as “CAMERALINK”™, was installed to a PCI Express slot of the PC <b>22</b> and used to capture frames <b>40</b>. The frames <b>40</b> are then stored temporarily in RAM <b>18</b>. This is very important, because otherwise it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to store and process 750 MB of data and display an image <b>12</b> that is reconstructed from such a large data set in real-time. In accordance with the present invention, the use of computer RAM <b>18</b> enables temporary storage of data.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">Referring in particular to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>8</b> <i>b</i>, the shift-and-add submethod of algorithm <b>26</b> is a fast processing method for reconstructing and displaying a panoramic layer <b>12</b> in real-time, and includes the following steps. In a first step <b>26</b> <i>a</i>, the final image <b>12</b> is initialized with zero values. In a second step <b>26</b> <i>b</i>, all the collected frames <b>40</b> are then processed one-by-one in the following manner: in a first substep <b>26</b> <i>b</i>′, for each frame pixel in an individual frame, the pixel position is calculated. In a second substep <b>26</b> <i>b</i>″, weighting coefficients are calculated according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>b</i>. In a third substep <b>26</b> <i>b</i>′″, the pixel value multiplied by the weighting factors is added to the pixel value of the final image <b>12</b> in locations specified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>b. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0064">Additionally, the system <b>10</b>, can comprise a dedicated or separate processing device, for example incorporated within the imaging device <b>14</b>, where the dedicated/separate processor runs the algorithm <b>26</b> or portion thereof for shifting and adding corresponding pixel values from at least two different frames to compose an image pixel in the panoramic image corresponding to a “virtual” speed profile different from the predetermined speed profile and a different (non-predetermined) layer. The speed profile relates to the speed at which the imaging device is actually scanning.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">The present system <b>10</b> takes the frame data <b>40</b> generated during a single exposure to selectively compose different types of images form the same frame data <b>40</b>. Preferably, the system <b>10</b> composes at least two of a group of images selected from the group of reconstructable images consisting of: a predetermined dental panoramic layer image; an image comprising part of a non-predetermined dental panoramic layer image and the predetermined panoramic layer image; a transverse slice to a selected part of a dental panoramic layer image; and a 3-D reconstruction of a volume corresponding to some part of a dental panoramic layer. With this feature, a selectable part of the predetermined layer can be replaced with an analogous part of a different non-predetermined layer, to accomplish the re-focusing feature of the present invention. This how auto-focusing/manual focusing/re-focusing feature of the present system <b>10</b> is enabled.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">After the display and processing, the data set <b>132</b> can be stored on a hard drive, a CD, a DVD and/or other nonvolatile digital storage media. The use of RAM <b>18</b> to store the data temporarily and the fast reconstruction algorithm <b>26</b> mentioned above allows the image <b>12</b> to be reconstructed and displayed no later than 10 seconds from the end of the exposure and usually within 5 seconds. In fact, the image <b>12</b> may be reconstructed from 750 MB of single frame data and displayed in real-time with a minimal delay (the delay needed for causality) during the actual exposure.</p>
  <heading>Example II</heading> <p num="p-0067">In another embodiment, the X-ray imaging device <b>14</b> produced multiple frames <b>40</b> during an exposure with time intervals during which the detector pixels were shifted by at least half a pixel length or more in the direction of scanning <b>104</b>. Additionally, the detector pixels were shifted by at least half a pixel size, but less than the size w of a full pixel in the direction of scanning.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, all the individual frames <b>40</b> are stored temporarily in a RAM-type fast memory <b>18</b>, and therefore it is possible to reconstruct the final image <b>12</b> with a modified position profile, after the actual exposure and after the initially displayed panoramic image <b>12</b>. It is known of course, that the data can additionally be stored long term on a data storage system <b>22</b> such as a hard drive, CD or DVD and retrieved later back into fast memory. However, storing all the data on RAM <b>18</b> makes processing fast and efficient. Such is now possible because the amount of data needed to be stored has been significantly reduced given the amount of overlap between frames, and because of the elongated shape of the active area <b>520</b>. Consequently, there is no need to wait for data to be downloaded, a process that normally takes several seconds. This, however, is not possible with TDI-type imaging devices, because the position synchronization has already been done in the camera hardware in analog domain, and thus cannot be modified.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">The shifted amount <b>76</b> between consecutive frames <b>40</b> is normally determined from the position information gathered during the measurement. This should give a panoramic image <b>12</b> with the layer-of-interest <b>52</b> in full focus. Unfortunately, due to misalignment of the patient <b>72</b>, or patient motion, different jaw profile or for many other reasons, there are very often portions in the panoramic image <b>12</b> that are out-of-focus or blurred. The shift <b>76</b> between consecutive frames <b>40</b> (i.e., the speed of the movement in the imaging plane <b>12</b>) determines which layer <b>99</b> is well focused. If the movement speed of the camera <b>14</b> with respect to the X-ray source <b>16</b> is V<sub>camera</sub>, the distance between X-ray source focal point <b>36</b> and the imaging plane <b>12</b> is d<sub>1</sub>, and the layer of interest <b>52</b> is at distance d<sub>2 </sub>from the focal point <b>36</b>, then the required speed V<sub>shift </sub>for the shift-and-add algorithm <b>26</b> is determined according to equation (1):
<br> <i>V</i> <sub>shift</sub>=(<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>/d</i> <sub>2</sub>)×<i>V</i> <sub>camera</sub>  (1)</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Thus, by modifying the shifting amount <b>76</b>, a different layer <b>99</b> can be focused. In theory; any layer <b>99</b> can be in focus, but the finite pixel size sets a limitation on how sharply a layer appears. If the shifting speed <b>76</b> is more than a pixel <b>53</b> per frame, the image resolution is degraded in the process. The shifting amount <b>76</b> can be modulated by software either globally or locally to allow either a completely different layer <b>99</b> to be displayed or to modify an existing layer to improve the sharpness in out-of-focus regions, which is usually the case in dental panoramic X-ray imaging.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">The shift speed <b>76</b> cannot only be modified on a column-by-column basis. In addition, the speed <b>76</b> can vary on a row-by-row basis (i.e., every part of the image <b>12</b> might have a different speed). This enables bringing into focus of both upper <b>180</b> and lower teeth <b>182</b>, for example, when the patient <b>19</b> has an incorrect bite (i.e., front and back teeth are not on the same vertical plane). This is an important feature of the present system <b>10</b>, and can have tremendous impact on today's practice of dental radiology, because the blurred part of the image <b>12</b> can be brought into focus and displayed with the rest of the original panoramic image. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to re-expose the patient <b>19</b> a second, much less a third time. In this manner, the layer-of-interest <b>52</b> can be modified by altering the shifting amount <b>76</b> in the shift-and-add algorithm <b>26</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the optimal speed profile <b>186</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) may be calculated. Additionally, the present system <b>10</b> is adaptable to create panoramic dental images <b>12</b> which have a focus depth selectably different in some but not in all portions when compared to the focus depth of a predetermined panoramic image.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">In still another embodiment, the system <b>10</b> is adapted to create panoramic dental images <b>12</b> in which the means of using multiple frames <b>40</b> comprises sub-pixel shifting and the adding of pixel values from different frames.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">In another embodiment, the system <b>10</b> includes a means for creating a transverse dental image slice <b>224</b>. This means uses multiple frames <b>40</b> to form the transverse image <b>224</b> by combining vertical pixel rows referring to the same physical transverse slice from multiple panoramic images.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in another embodiment, the dental X-ray imaging system <b>10</b> of the invention includes an algorithm <b>400</b> which uses the multiple frames <b>40</b> to compose a transverse slice <b>224</b> with respect to a panoramic image. The algorithm <b>400</b> includes subroutines <b>400</b> <i>a </i>and <b>400</b> <i>b</i>. In the first subroutine <b>400</b> <i>a</i>, in a first step <b>402</b>, frame data <b>304</b> is used to reset the change in velocity ΔV to the original change in velocity ΔV<sub>orig</sub>. In a second step <b>404</b>, the user specifies a region of interest. In a third step <b>406</b>, the region of interest is reconstructed at the original speed ΔV<sub>orig </sub>plus the change in velocity ΔV. In a fourth step <b>410</b>, the reconstructed region of interest is resized to a fixed size. In a fifth step <b>412</b>, the resized reconstructed region of interest is pushed to the image layer stack. In a sixth step <b>414</b>, a blur function is calculated and stored. In a seventh step <b>416</b>, if delta velocity ΔV is greater than a particular limit, then the stack is processed in a transverse slice calculation subroutine <b>400</b> <i>b</i>; otherwise, delta velocity ΔV is increased and the process returns to the third step <b>406</b> and continues. The transverse slice subroutine <b>400</b> thus forms a transverse image slice <b>224</b> in addition to a panoramic layer <b>60</b> using the frames <b>40</b> accumulated during the same exposure. In transverse imaging, the layer-of-interest <b>69</b> is perpendicular to a panoramic layer <b>52</b>. Usually this is done as described earlier, but in accordance with this embodiment of the invention, this is performed more elegantly.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">As described earlier, multiple panoramic layers can be calculated from a single measurement data set. By intelligently calculating correct speed modulation function, a transverse slice image <b>224</b> can be formed by concatenating the corresponding rows from individual panoramic layers in order of increasing depth. The algorithm <b>400</b> <i>b </i>has the following steps: In a first step, method <b>400</b> <i>b</i>′ is applied to calculate multiple panoramic images, stored in a stack. In a second step <b>400</b> <i>b</i>″, the contribution of the 3D physical structure at different distances is calculated for every panoramic image <b>12</b>. Every panoramic image <b>12</b> contains the image of the 3D physical model not only at the layer-of-interest, but also in front of and in back of it. This can be modeled using a blur function. In this step <b>400</b> <i>b</i>′″, the blurring is reversed using a de-convolution method, and thus the true image at different panoramic layers without crosstalk between neighboring layers is formed. The transverse image <b>224</b>, formed by concatenating different panoramic layers <b>60</b>, may now be displayed. Contrary to U.S. Pat. No. 6,496,557, which describes a system where the imaging plane is perpendicular or roughly perpendicular to the direction of radiation, the present invention discloses a system <b>10</b> which provides a layer <b>60</b> parallel (or close to parallel) to the direction of radiation.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, additionally, an imaging method <b>229</b> can be used to provide limited volumetric 3D images. The method <b>229</b> is an iterative algorithm, which, in step <b>229</b> <i>a</i>, uses the geometry data (i.e., 3D location of X-ray source and the detector and the related movement profiles) to form re-projection data (i.e., estimates of the projected frames <b>40</b> based on the present 3D model). Then, in step <b>229</b> <i>b</i>, the software calculates the error between measured and re-projected frames <b>40</b>. In step <b>229</b> <i>c</i>, this error is used to update the current 3D estimate. This operation is applied to a region-of-interest specified by the user. Because of the limited number of views, narrow projection rotational angles and narrow projection width, it is very important to use prior data in the reconstruction. Prior data is used to set restrictions on the 3D model, like smoothness, to produce and unique and meaningful result. The 3D image obtained is not comparable to full CT images in quality, but is sufficient for dental operations.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">An object of the invention is to produce selectively predetermined dental panoramic image layers, dental panoramic X-ray images of different layers, dental transverse X-ray images and dental X-ray images from a frame stream produced by a high-speed, X-ray digital imaging device.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">In an advantage, the system's <b>10</b> functioning on data from a single exposure spares the patient multiple exposures and allows for the first time effectively risk free exposures in dental radiology. Such system <b>10</b> has unique advantages and offers a breakthrough in the field of dental radiology.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">In another advantage, the dentist is able with a single system <b>10</b> and single exposures to do examinations that previously required at least two if not more systems totaling a multiple in cost and a multiple of risk in patient diagnosis and treatment. Examinations become safer and less expensive for the patients who now only need take one exposure.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">In another advantage, the system <b>10</b> applies little more radiation than the radiation dose used in a regular dental panoramic exposure and should employ X-ray scan mechanics that operate in continuous movement.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">In another advantage, continuous movement means that the speed of scanning V is greater than zero at all times during the scan. The speed need not be constant.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">In an advantage, CdTe or CdZnTe based digital imaging devices have an excellent sensitivity and absorb 95% of the incoming x-rays at dental application energies (i.e., from 10 kV up to 90 kV X-ray tube load).</p>
  <p num="p-0084">In another advantage, the need for non-continuous, step-wise scans are eliminated, thus reducing the radiation doses and eliminating the longer step-wise scans, which create higher risk and discomfort to the patient. Because a continuous fast X-ray scan is possible, one does not need separate specialized dental equipment other than the normal panoramic X-ray units.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">In another advantage, a system <b>10</b> and method are provided of combining data from a single exposure to not only reconstruct a panoramic layer of interest, but also to be able to correct part of the image that is blurred and furthermore produce transverse image slices and 3D images.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">In another advantage, the system <b>10</b> and method of the invention produce a variety of formats of panoramic images from a high-speed, X-ray digital imaging device.</p>
