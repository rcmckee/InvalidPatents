    <p>This application claims priority of provisional application 60/013,733, filed Mar. 20, 1996 and provisional application 60/023,090, filed Jul. 25, 1996.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p>The present invention relates to a tricyclic compound with excellent binding affinity for melatonin receptor, a process for producing and use thereof.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading> <p>Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), which is a hormone synthesized and secreted principally in the pineal gland, increases in dark circumstances and decreases in light circumstances. Melatonin exerts suppressively on pigment cells and the female gonads, and acts as a synchronous factor of biological clock while taking part in transmittance of photoperiodic code. Therefore, melatonin is expected to be used for the therapy of diseases related with melatonin activity, such as reproduction and endocrinic disorders, sleep-awake rhythm disorders, jet-lag syndrome and various disorders related to aging, etc.</p>
    <p>Recently, it has been reported that the production of melatonin melatonin could reset the body's aging clock (see Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., Vol. 719, pp. 456-460 (1994)). As previously reported, however, melatonin is easily metabolized by metabolic enzymes in vivo (see Clinical Examinations, Vol. 38, No. 11, pp. 282-284 (1994)). Therefore, it cannot be said that melatonin is suitable as a pharmaceutical substance.</p>
    <p>Various melatonin agonists and antagonists such as those mentioned below are known.</p>

    <p>For producing an optically active compound (I), a method, which comprises subjecting compound (XXXV) to reduction using, for example, a catalyst for asymmetric reduction, followed by subjecting the resultant to acylation, is employed.</p>
    <p>As the catalyst for asymmetric reduction, mention is made of, for example, transition metal--optically active phosphine complexes.

    <p>Experimental Example 1</p>
    <p>Inhibition of 2-[<sup>125</sup> I]iodomelatonin binding activity.</p>
    <p>The forebrains of 7-day-old chicken (white leghorn) were homogenized with ice-cold assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7 at 25° C.) and centrifuged at 44,000×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The pellet was washed once with the same buffer and storred at -30° C. until use. For the assay, the frozen tissue pellet was thawed and homogenized with the assay buffer to make a protein concentration of 0.3-0.4 mg/ml. An 0.4 ml aliquot of this homogenate was incubated with a test compound and 80 pM 2-[<sup>125</sup> I]iodomelatonin in a total volume of 0.5 ml for 90 minutes at 25° C. The reaction was terminated by adding 3 ml of ice-cold assay buffer immediately followed by vaccum filtration on Whatman GF/B which was further washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold assay buffer. The radioactivity on the filter was determined by means of γ-counter. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting non-specific binding which was determined in the presence of 10<sup>-5</sup> M melatonin. The 50% inhibiting concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) was determined by the log-probit analysis. The results are shown in Table 3.</p>
