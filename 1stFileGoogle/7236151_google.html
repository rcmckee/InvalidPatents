<heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This regular application claims the benefit of co-pending provisional applications 60/565,586, filed 04/27/2004 and 60/539,873, filed Jan. 28, 2004.</p>
<p num="p-0003">This application was made in part with United States Government support under cooperative agreement No. DAAB07-03-C-J406 awarded by the Department of Defense. The government may have certain rights in this invention.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">A revolution in the information display technology began in the early 1970s with the invention of the liquid crystal display (LCD). Because the LCD is a flat-panel display of light weight and low power which provides a visual read out that conforms to the small size, weight and battery demands of a handheld electronic device, this display technology enabled a new broad class of handheld and other portable products. Commercially, the LCD first appeared in volume as a digital readout on wrist watches, then on instruments and, later, enabled the laptop computer, personal data assistant and many other digital devices. Today LCD technology is even replacing cathode ray tubes in televisions and PCs.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Nearly every commercial LCD display manufactured and sold today is on glass substrates. Glass offers many features suitable for the manufacture of LCDs. It can be processed at high temperatures, it is rigid and suitably rugged for batch processing methods used in high volume manufacturing, its surface can be made very smooth and uniform over large areas and it has desirable optical properties such as high transparency. There are many applications, however, where glass is far from being the ideal substrate material. Glass substrates cannot be made very flexible and are not very rugged, being unsuitable for web manufacturing and subject to easy breakage. As a result there is a large worldwide effort to develop displays on more flexible and rugged substrates that can not only conform to three-dimensional configurations but which can also be repeatedly flexed. A display is desired that has the flexibility of a thin plastic sheet, paper or fabric, so that it can be draped, rolled up or folded like paper or cloth. This would not only make the display more portable and easier to carry, it would expand its potential applications well beyond those of the typical flat panel information displays known today: A display worn on the sleeve; the back of a bicyclists coat that shows changing direction signals; textile that changes its color or design are but a few examples.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">While the ability of an electrically addressable liquid crystal display to be flexible and deform like cloth or paper would be advantageous for any LCD technology, it is especially advantageous in applications suited to cholesteric liquid crystal displays. Cholesteric displays can be made highly reflective such that they can be seen in bright daylight or a dimly lit room without the aid of a heavy and power consuming backlight. Since cholesteric liquid crystals can be made to be bistable they require power only when being addressed, further adding to the power savings associated with such displays. Cholesteric liquid crystalline materials are unique in their optical and electro-optical features. Of principal significance, they can be tailored to Bragg reflect light at a pre-selected wavelength and bandwidth. This feature comes about because these materials posses a helical structure in which the liquid crystal (LC) director twists around a helical axis. The distance over which the director rotates 360° is referred to as the pitch and is denoted by P. The reflection band of a cholesteric liquid crystal is centered at the wavelength, λ<sub>O</sub>=0.5(n<sub>e </sub>+n<sub>o</sub>)P and has the bandwidth, Δλ=(n<sub>e</sub>−n<sub>o</sub>)P which is usually about 100 nm where n<sub>e </sub>and n<sub>o </sub>are the extra-ordinary and ordinary refractive indices of the LC, respectively. The reflected light is circularly polarized with the same handedness as the helical structure of the LC. If the incident light is not polarized, it will be decomposed into two circularly polarized components with opposite handedness and one of the components reflected. The cholesteric material can be electrically switched to either one of two stable textures, planar or focal conic, or to a homeotropically aligned state if a suitably high electric field is maintained. In the planar texture the helical axis is oriented perpendicular to the substrate to Bragg reflect light in a selected wavelength band whereas in the focal conic texture it is oriented, on the average, parallel to the substrate so that the material is transparent to all wavelengths except for weak light scattering, negligible on an adjacent dark background. These bistable structures can be electronically switched between each other at rapid rates on the order of milliseconds. Gray scale is also available in that only a portion of a pixel can be switched to the reflective state thereby controlling the reflective intensity.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">The bistable cholesteric reflective display technology was introduced in the early 1990's as a low power, sunlight readable technology intended primarily for use on handheld devices. Such portable devices demand long battery lifetimes requiring the display to consume very little power. Cholesteric displays are ideal for this application as the bistability feature avoids the need for refreshing power and high reflectivity avoids the need for power-consuming backlights. These combined features can extend battery life times from hours to months over displays that do not have these features. Reflective displays are also easily read in very bright sunlight where backlit displays are ineffective. Because of the high reflective brightness of a cholesteric display and its exceptional contrast, a cholesteric display can be easily read in a dimly lit room. The wide view angle offered by a cholesteric display allows several persons to see the display image at the same time from different positions. In the case of cholesteric materials possessing positive dielectric anisotropy, modes of operation other than a bistable mode are possible by applying a field to untwist the cholesteric material into a transparent, homeotropic texture. Quick removal of the field transforms the material into the reflective planar texture. The more fundamental aspects of such modem cholesteric displays are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,437,811 and 5,453,863, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Bistable cholesteric liquid crystal displays have several important electronic drive features that other bistable reflective technologies do not. Of extreme importance for addressing a matrix display of many pixels is the characteristic of a voltage threshold. A threshold voltage is essential for multiplexing a row/column matrix without the need of an expensive active matrix (transistor at each pixel). Bistability with a voltage threshold allows very high-resolution displays to be produced with low-cost passive matrix technology.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">In addition to bistable cholesteric displays with liquid crystalline materials having a positive dielectric anisotropy, it is possible to fabricate a cholesteric display with liquid crystalline materials having a negative dielectric anisotropy as, for example, described in the U.S. Pat. No. 3,680,950 to Haas et al., or 5,200,845 to Crooker et al., incorporated herein by reference. These “negative materials” like the “positive” materials are chiral nematic liquid crystals that are prepared from nematic materials that have been twisted into a helical molecular arrangement by the addition of chiral compound or collection of chiral compounds. The negative and positive materials are prepared from nematic liquid crystals with either a negative or positive dielectric anisotropy respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Negative type cholesteric displays can operate in a bistable mode where the material is switched into the stable planar (e.g., color reflective) texture with an AC pulse or into the stable focal conic (e.g., transparent) texture with a DC pulse as described by U.S. Pat. No. 3,680,950. There are other modes of operation such as has been disclosed by Crooker where a droplet dispersion of negative cholesteric materials is switched into the planar, color reflective texture with an applied electric field, but relaxes back into a transparent texture when the field is removed.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Some cholesteric materials possess a dielectric anisotropy that can be negative under an applied electric field of one frequency but positive at another frequency. This feature can be used to drive a bistable display using a dual frequency drive scheme as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,320,563, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Another important feature of cholesteric materials is that the layers reflecting red, green, and blue (RGB) colors as well as IR night vision can be stacked (layered) on top of each other without optically interfering with each other. This makes maximum use of the display surface for reflection and hence brightness. This feature is not held by traditional displays were the display is broken into pixels of different colors and only one third of the incident light is reflected. Using all available light is important for observing a reflective display in a dimly lit room without a backlight. Gray scale capability allows stacked RGB, high-resolution displays with full-color capability where as many as 4096 colors have been demonstrated. Because a cholesteric display cell does not require polarizers, low cost birefringent plastic substrates such a PET can be used. Other features, such as wide viewing-angles and wide operating temperature ranges as well as fast response times make the cholesteric bistable reflective technology, the technology of choice for many low power applications.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Cholesteric liquid crystals are particularly well suited for flexible substrates. Such cholesteric displays have been reported by Minolta Co. Ltd. and by Kent Displays, Inc. involving two plastic substrates filled with cholesteric liquid crystal materials (Society for Information Display Proceedings, 1998, pp 897–900 and 51–54, respectively). While the substrates themselves are flexible, the assembled displays are much less flexible because of the lamination of two substrates together. Minolta has developed procedures for manufacturing flexible displays with two substrates as seen in U.S. Pat. No. 6,459,467.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">Greater flexibility can be achieved if only one substrate is used and the display materials are coated or printed on the substrate. Cholesteric liquid crystals are made suitable for standard coating and printing techniques by forming them into polymer droplet dispersions. As droplet dispersions, the materials are made insensitive to pressure and shear such that an image on a bistable cholesteric display is not readily erased by flexing the substrate. Recently, Stephenson et al., at Kodak fabricated flexible bistable reflective displays with polymer dispersions of cholesteric liquid crystals on a single transparent plastic substrate using photographic methods (U.S. Published Application No. 2003/0202136 A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,788,362 B2). This process involves a sequence of depositions on transparent polyester plastic whereby the end product is a display where the images are viewed through the substrate. Such a process requires substrate materials that are transparent such as a clear plastic sheet.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In view of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide a reflective display that does not require a transparent substrate, making available a broader range of substrate materials such as fabrics made of fibers that can be deformed such as by bending, rolling, draping or folding. These added features offer many advantages and open up many new display applications. Use of flexible and drapable substrates can bring to the market place new displays that have the physical deformability of fabric so that they can be an integral part of clothing and have the feel and appearance of cloth because they can be draped and folded.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0016">In view of the foregoing, it is therefore an object of the invention to provide an electrically addressable liquid crystal display having the physical deformability or drapability of textile or cloth which may incorporate, inter alia, any of the aforementioned liquid crystal materials and technologies. This invention also brings advantages in manufacturing where the display including the electrodes is made of organic materials that are coated or printed on the substrate. Conducting polymers are used instead of the traditional inorganic materials such as indium tin oxide (ITO) for the electrodes. On some fabrics, preparation layers are used to color, smooth or planarize the surface, adjust the resistivity, index match and other features. Polymer dispersions of cholesteric liquid crystals can be made from a wide variety of different methods as is suitable for various manufacturing processes or display function.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0036">This invention involves a substantial advance in addressable liquid crystal displays wherein, by forming the displays on or integrally with a drapable substrate, the display itself is drapable. Such substrates include textiles or fabrics made of natural or man-made fibers such as cloth or paper, as well as non-fiberous materials such as flexible or even drapable thin polymeric sheets or films. Advantageously, the substrate need not be transparent. With deformable substrates, cholesteric or other liquid crystal displays are made flexible, rugged and can even be sewn into or onto clothing to provide a wearable display. In fact, the display itself can form the material used to make the clothing or other fabric construct. A display with the drapability of cloth provides a new dimension to display technology enabling display applications that were not previously possible. Such displays can conform to three dimensional structures or flex and fold with a garment or other fabric construct containing the display. To this end, the displays according to the invention are operatively deformable, meaning that they will function even though they are or have been deformed. In preferred applications, the displays according to the invention will be operatively drapable such that they can have folds and possess a measurable drape coefficient.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">The formability of a fabric or other drapable substrate material can be defined as its ability to re-form from a two-dimensional shape to a simple or complex three-dimensional shape. The drape coefficient is used to describe the degree of 3-D deformation when the fabric specimen is draped over a drapemeter as described, for example, in the publication: “Effect of Woven Fabric Anisotropy on Drape Behavior,” ISSN 1392-1320<i>, Materials Science </i>(Medziagotyra), Vol. 9, No. 1, pp. 111–115 (2003) by V. Sidabraitre and V. Masteikaite, or “Modeling the Fused Panel for a Numerical Simulation of Drape” <i>Fibers and Textiles</i>, Vol. 12, pages 47–52 (2004), by S. Jevsnik and J. Gersak, incorporated herein by reference. Drapability is a phenomenon that occurs when a material such as a curtain, flag, table cloth or flared skirt hangs from an object. The drape coefficient, DC, describes any deformation between draped and undraped material. In terms of percentage, it is described by the ratio: DC=100(S<sub>P</sub>−πR<sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup>)/(πR<sub>2</sub> <sup>2</sup>−πR<sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup>) were R<sub>2 </sub>is the radius of a circular cut of non-deformed fabric; R<sub>1</sub>, the radius of a horizontal disc holding the fabric, and S<sub>P </sub>the projected area of the draped specimen, including the part covered by the horizontal disc. The value of DC varies between zero and 100%. Since the value of DC can depend on the values selected for R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>of the drapemeter, we follow others in taking R<sub>1</sub>=9 cm and R<sub>2</sub>=15 cm. The larger the value of the drape coefficient, the stiffer the fabric and more difficult to reform. Alternatively, the lower the value of DC, the easier to reform and adapt to shapes. Some examples of desirable fabric substrate materials include silk, cotton, nylon, rayon, polyester, Kevlar, or similar materials made of fibrous material formed by woven and non-woven means having the deformability of cloth. Some examples of fabrics having the desired drapability are shown in Table I, which shows measured values of the drape coefficient, DC, for various fabric materials made with R<sub>2</sub>=15 cm and R<sub>1</sub>=9 cm. The data on the materials identified with an aserisk (*) were obtained from the publication “The Dependence of Fabric Drape on Bending and Shear Stiffness, <i>J. Textile Institute</i>, Vol. 56, pp. 596–606 (1965) by G. E. Cusick, incorporated herein by reference. The other materials were obtained from Jo-Ann Fabrics, Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio and Hudson, Ohio, and the DC values measured.</p>

  <p num="p-0039">As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure, any deformable material having the desired flexibility or drapability and capable of supporting the display elements as disclosed herein will be suitable for use in the invention. In some preferred embodiments, the fabric substrate may be a composite or, more preferably, a fiber reinforced composite such as cotton and polyisoprene. An example of such composites is a raincoat where the cotton provides the feel and drapability of cloth and polyisoprene provides water resistance. Another example is rayon and neoprene used as a light shield against laser light such as that obtained by Thorlabs, Inc. (NJ) catalog # BK5. Composites can be useful substrate materials for many of the preferred displays of the invention in that they may require less planarization for the display elements.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">In many preferred embodiments, the substrate material is non transparent. While black is a preferred color, other colors such as dark blue, green or some other color may be used to additively mix with the reflective color of the cholesteric liquid crystal to provide the desired color of text or other image addressed on the display. The substrate material itself may be substantially clear or transparent but the substrate made non-transparent by adding a black coating or dye to render it opaque, translucent or non-transparent as required for the background of the display. The image on a reflective cholesteric display is viewed against the background. It is therefore important that the background absorb unwanted light and not provide light that competes with or washes out light reflected from the cholesteric liquid crystal. Most fabrics are non-transparent. There are many examples of deformable sheet materials that are not made of fibers such as polymer films. If the sheet is thin enough, these films may also be drapable. An example of a polymer film that is non-transparent and very drapable is black static cling polyvinyl chloride sheet material from Graphix Plastics, Cleveland Ohio. Other examples of non-fiberous and drapable plastic sheets having the desired drapability are shown in Table II, which shows measured values of the drape coefficient, DC, for various non-fiberous sheet materials (R<sub>1</sub>=9 cm and R<sub>2</sub>=5 cm). The value of the drape coefficient was measured by photographing from above, the drape of the specimen of radius R<sub>2 </sub>draped over a pedestal of radius R<sub>1 </sub>under a weighed disk of the same radius. The areas of the projected image of the drape in the circle of radius R<sub>2 </sub>were obtained from the digital photograph. In all cases, the drape showed the characteristic folds.</p>

  <p num="p-0042">Sheet materials which are too thick do not exhibit drape but may bend or be flexed about one axis such as, for example, being rolled up. An example is 5 mil (0.125 mm thick) Clear DuraLar (polyester) or 5 mil thick Teijin Limited polycarbonate ITO coated foil (SS120-B30). Such 2-D deformation materials can be rolled up but do not reflect the nature of drape. It should be noted, however, that these and similar films will be suitable for certain embodiments of the invention where drapability is not required. For example, where only a flexible display is desired, such films can be rendered black or otherwise non-transparent for use as a substrate by coating it with a black Krylon paint.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">It will be apparent from the following that while the principal advantages of the invention are realized by the presentation of a deformable liquid crystal display, a principal contributor to the realization of this advantage is the provision of an electrically addressable liquid crystal display on a single substrate. Electrically addressable displays on the market today employ at least two substrates which, as noted above, are generally rigid, with the liquid crystal sandwiched between them. These displays are, in general, manufactured by batch processing methods. In accordance with the preferred embodiments of the present invention, a display element on a single substrate is fabricated by a sequence of layers as may be placed on the substrate by coating, printing or lamination techniques suitable for the web processing methods necessary for low cost, high volume production. Fundamentally, these layers consist of a first conductive layer followed by a layer of an electrically responsive droplet dispersion such as a polymer dispersed cholesteric liquid crystal, followed next by a transparent conductive layer. Coating on textiles or other fabrics may require a planarization coating to at least partially smooth the surface. This may be followed by a preparation coating or sequence of such coatings to further smooth the surface of the fabric as well as adjust its color, resistivity, wetting and adhesive properties with respect to the first conductive layer. Insulation coatings are often needed between the cholesteric dispersion and electrodes to avoid electrical shorts between the electrodes. A durable protective layer is coated to finalize construction of the display element. In some cases an isolation layer is required between some of the coatings to avoid damage by subsequent coatings, such as may be caused by a chemical reaction between coating solvents or other components. Likewise, preparation coatings between various layers may be necessary to promote wetting and adhesion of the subsequent coat. In some embodiments, the coatings often serve multiple functions, such as where the first conductive coat may also serve as a preparation coat to smooth the surface.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">The electro-optic layer can further consist of several coatings of cholesteric dispersions with different reflective colors or twist handedness as desired for multiple colors or high brightness. For color, enhanced brightness or infrared applications such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,654,080, incorporated herein by reference, stacks of coatings arranged as disclosed therein can be employed in accordance with the instant invention. The coating of the upper conductive electrodes with a protective coat avoids the need to laminate an upper substrate. Such display configurations on a single substrate improve the flexibility of the display as well as its brightness and contrast. Such displays according to the invention exhibit improved ruggedness because the protective coat can be more difficult to delaminate than an upper laminated substrate.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">While the invention will be described herein primarily in conjunction with the preferred use of cholesteric liquid crystals, any liquid crystal material that can be adapted to use in connection with the foregoing substrates will be suitable for use in accordance with the present invention. Such materials include, by way of example only, nematic, chiral nematic (cholesteric), smectic and ferroelectric smectic liquid crystal materials. They include materials which are bistable and those which are not bistable. They include cholesteric or chiral nematic liquid crystals having positive or negative dielectric anisotropy or a combination of negative and positive with a crossover frequency suitable for dual frequency addressing. They include cholesteric materials having pitch lengths reflecting in the visible spectrum as well as those having pitches reflecting outside the visible spectrum, including ultraviolet and infrared. Preferred liquid crystal materials for use in the present invention are bistable cholesteric (chiral nematic) liquid crystals having positive dielectric anisotropy. Especially preferred materials are nematic materials with a high birefringence and dielectric anisotropy with a chiral additive to twist the material to a pitch length to reflect in the visible spectrum such as BL061, BL048 and BL131 from EM Industries of Hawthorne, N.Y. These and other suitable materials will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the instant disclosure, the liquid crystal material will preferably be present in the displays of the invention in the form of liquid crystalline layers comprised of a liquid crystal dispersion and, most preferably, a cholesteric droplet dispersion. There are many different approaches to the formation of a layer of liquid crystal droplets, some of which have been used for cholesteric liquid crystals. To form such a liquid crystal layer, the liquid crystal can be microencapsulated, formed into a layer of phase separated liquid crystal droplets, or formed into emulsified droplets of liquid crystal.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">More specifically, one process suitable for forming liquid crystal layers for use in the invention is phase separation, which is basically a process that involves mixing the cholesteric liquid crystalline material with a pre-polymer solution then polymerizing the polymer under suitable conditions to form a dispersion of droplets in a polymer binder. Polymerization and, hence, droplet formation, occurs after the material mixture has been coated, either onto a temporary or interim substrate, or onto the display substrate itself. There are basically three types of polymerization techniques that can be used depending on the polymer (or monomer): (1) thermally induced phase separation (TIPS); (2) polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS); and, (3) solvent induced phase separation (SIPS).</p>
  <p num="p-0048">The thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) process has been used to show that a cholesteric material will maintain its bistability and electro-optical features when encapsulated into a droplet structure as disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,061,107, incorporated herein by reference. The TIPS system is a binary mixture of a liquid crystal and a thermoplastic polymer. At high temperatures, the polymer is melted and the materials are in solution. As temperature is lowered, the liquid crystal phase separates to form droplets as the polymer solidifies. The droplet size can be controlled by the cooling rate with smaller droplets being formed at faster cooling rates. TIPS is advantageous in controlling droplet size because cooling rates are easily adjusted. Furthermore, the system can be thermally cycled many times and different droplet sizes can be obtained in the same sample using different cooling rates. There are many thermoplastic polymers that can be used for this process. Some examples are PMMA (poly methyl methacrylate), which provides a tangential anchoring condition for the elongated liquid crystal molecules and PIEMB (poly isobutyl methacrylate), which provides a perpendicular anchoring condition. Other polymers suitable for use in this and the embodiments that follow would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">Polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS) starts with a homogeneous mixture of a prepolymer (monomer) and a liquid crystal. As the monomers are polymerized, the liquid crystal phase separates from the polymer. The polymerization can be thermal-initiated or photo-initiated. In thermal-initiated polymerization, the monomers are typically combinations of epoxy resins and thiol curing agent, such as Epon 828 (Shell Chemical) or Capcure 3800 (Miller Stephenson Company). The mixture, coated at room temperature, can then be cured at an elevated temperature. In general, smaller droplets are formed at higher temperatures or higher concentrations of epoxy resins because of the higher reaction rate. In photo-initiated polymerization, monomers with acrylate or methyacrylate end groups, such as Norland 65 (which is a combination of acrylate monomers and photo-initiators), are used. Some photo-initiators are also needed. In sample preparation, the mixture is printed or coated then cured under the irradiation of UV light. Smaller droplets are formed under higher uv irradiation.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">In the SIPS method, the initial material is a mixture of a liquid crystal and a thermoplastic dissolved in a common solvent. When the concentration of the solvent is sufficiently high, the components are homogeneously mixed. As the solvent evaporates, the system phase separates. The droplet size of the liquid crystal depends on the solvent evaporation rate with smaller droplets obtained at faster evaporation rates.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">In accordance with the foregoing, those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select suitable materials and methods for producing phase separated liquid crystal droplet layers for use in the present invention. In some cases, it may be preferable to use a combination of the PIPS, SIPS and TIPS processes. The PIPS, SIPS and TIPS methods and materials are well known in the art as disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,688,900 and 4,684,771, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">Another very different encapsulation process involves emulsification of a cholesteric liquid crystal in water with a waterborne polymer. Encapsulation of cholesteric liquid crystals by emulsification was practiced even before the invention of bistable cholesteric displays. As early as 1970, cholesteric materials were emulsified for making cholesteric thermal and electrical responsive coatings as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,600,060, incorporated herein by reference. More recently, emulsification methods have been refined by Stevenson et al., at Kodak to make cholesteric droplets that are very uniform in size, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. 6,423,368 B1, incorporated herein by reference. The most common emulsification procedure basically involves a liquid crystal being dispersed in an aqueous bath containing a water-soluble binder material such as de-ionized gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or latex. Water acts as a solvent and dissolves the polymer to form a viscous solution. This aqueous solution does not dissolve the liquid crystal, and they phase separate. When a propeller blade at a sufficiently high speed stirs this system, the micron size liquid crystal droplets are formed. Smaller liquid crystal droplets form at higher stirring speeds as disclosed in P. Drzaic, <i>Liquid Crystal Dispersions</i>, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore (1995), incorporated by reference. The molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer is also a factor affecting the droplet size. After the droplets are formed, the emulsion is coated on a substrate and the water is allowed to evaporate. There are many different emulsification procedures. In preferred embodiments, one or more of PVA, gelatin and latex, preferably urethane based latex, are used to form the binder. Especially preferred polyurethane latex materials are NeoRez R967, and Witcobond W232 or W786. The emulsification method has the advantage that the droplet dispersions may contain a very high percentage of cholesteric material. As with the phase separated liquid crystal layers, those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select suitable materials and methods for providing emulsified liquid crystal droplet layers for use in accordance with the present invention in view of the instant disclosure.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">Microencapsulation is a yet another process for preparing droplet dispersions as seen, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,271,898, incorporated herein by reference. While this procedure can be more complex and material sensitive, it can nonetheless provide more control over droplet size and molecular anchoring conditions for the cholesteric liquid crystal. In this case the liquid crystal droplet is coated by a shell isolating it from the binder. It may be possible to process the droplet particles in the form of a wet cake or slurry which is later dispersed in a suitable binder for coating. Other types of dispersions may be a regular array of polymer pockets filled with liquid crystalline material and sealed on the top by a phase separation process as disclosed in, for example, D. J. Broer et al, Society for Information Display 2004 Proceedings, pp 767.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">In some embodiments, the substrate material will be formed by applying coated or printed layers directly on a deformable polymeric sheet that has a relatively smooth surface on or into which to incorporate the display elements. Alternatively, a fabric can be manufactured to have a smooth surface, such as with a neoprene coating that serves to partially planarize the surface of the fabric. However, in many embodiments of the invention the display will be formed on or integrally with substrates having rough surfaces such as cloth and similar fabric or textile materials. In embodiments where the surface of the substrate is undesirably rough, the substrate will require some degree of planarization in order to provide a smoother surface onto which the first electrode may be deposited. Smoothing out the surface helps to maintain a constant thickness for the cholesteric or other electro-optic layer. Planarization can be achieved in any number of ways, from the application of an organic layer, application of heat and/or mechanical pressure or the chemical modification of the surface. For example, one might smooth a substrate surface by application of a polymer coating followed by application of physical stress and heat, such as from a hot roll laminator. Alternatively, one can chemically treat the surface to melt or otherwise bring about a physical change in its degree of smoothness. Of course, as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the degree of smoothness necessary is relative as long as it serves to help maintain a uniform thickness or gap between the electrodes so as to provide a uniform electric field and, consequently, drive uniformity across the entire display. Planarization need not render the substrate surface perfectly smooth or flat. In fact, in many embodiments the electrodes and liquid crystal layers of the displays of the invention will follow the minute contours of a fabric substrate, with the planarization layer or other planarization means functioning to eliminate only the most dramatic fluctuations in the substrate surface. Thus, these and other suitable means of planarizing (i.e., smoothing out) the substrate surface will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the instant disclosure.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">A preferred manner of planarizing the substrate surface in accordance with the invention is the addition of a planarization layer. A planarization layer is a coating of material which, when applied to the substrate, will tend to smooth out the most dramatic fluctuations in the substrate so as to provide a generally smooth, though not necessarily flat, surface onto which to deposit the conducting electrodes. Preferred materials for use as a planarization layer in accordance with the invention are gelatin, neoprene and latex materials such NeoRez R967 available from NeoResins, Mass. The planarization layer also may be a polymeric sheet such as PET laminated onto the substrate.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">As noted, the liquid crystal layer will, in the preferred embodiments, be bounded by conducting electrodes. The electrodes need not be identical. For example, in many embodiments, the electrode on the non-viewing side of the liquid crystal will be black or some other color, while the electrode on the view side will be transparent. In other embodiments, the electrodes on both sides of the liquid crystal layer will be transparent. In other embodiments still, an electrode or array of electrodes can be formed integrally with the substrate or the substrate itself can form one of the electrodes. An advantage to being able to use fabric substrates is that it enables greater flexibility in the manner in which the display can be configured. There are potentially many methods of applying and patterning the conductors. The conductors may be printed in some specified pattern using ink jet, screen or off-set printing. Alternatively the conducting materials may by sprayed or coated onto the fabric using a mask, stencil or pretreating the surface to form a chemical mask which allows the electrode material to only adhere to certain areas. In some cases it may be desirable to first lay down a uniform conducting coat and subsequently pattern the layer by chemically or mechanically deactivating regions of conductive material. In fact, it is contemplated that even the substrate itself can be manufactured as the conductor. For example, some flexible plastic materials are manufactured with an indium tin oxide (ITO) coating that may be patterned for use as electrodes. Suitable electrode materials for application to the substrates of the invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the instant disclosure and include conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes, metal or carbon conductive inks, ITO and the like. Electrode materials which are self leveling and which can be used in suitable thicknesses to obviate the need for a planarization layer are particularly desirable. Examples of materials for use as conducting electrodes in accordance with the present invention include Agfa conducting polymers ELP-3040, S300, and S2500 available from Agfa-Gevaert N.V., Belguim; Carbon Nanotube materials are available from EiKos,Inc., Franklin Mass.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">The aforementioned electrodes can be patterned, formed into pixels of varying shapes or sizes, aligned into rows and columns so as to form a passive matrix and so on, all as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the instant disclosure. Any means for addressing the liquid crystal known in the art and adaptable to a display having the deformability of the instant invention can be employed. In the preferred electrically addressable displays, the means for addressing the liquid crystal will be drive and control electronics operatively linked to the electrodes for application of driving voltages across the liquid crystal material in accordance with any suitable drive scheme known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples of suitable drive schemes include, but are not limited to, the conventional drive scheme disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,644,330 implemented with either bipolar or unipolar drive chips, the dynamic drive scheme disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,748,277 or 6,154,190 for faster or lower temperature response, or the cumulative drive scheme disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,895, for video response, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the means for addressing can be an optical method whereby the image is written on the display with white light or laser light in a manner such as disclosed in H. Yoshida et al., Journal of the SID, Vol. 5/3, 269–274, (1997), also incorporated herein by reference. Of course, in these embodiments, the displays can be fabricated without patterned electrodes.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">In a preferred configuration, a high resolution display device in accordance with the invention is configured where the first conducting polymer is printed or otherwise patterned in the form of parallel strips to form rows of parallel conducting electrodes. The droplet dispersion is then coated on top of the rows of conductors, followed by a transparent conductor which is then printed, or otherwise coated and patterned on top of the droplet dispersion in the form of conductive strips (columns) in a direction perpendicular to the rows of conductors that are under the dispersion. In this way, a row and column matrix of electrodes is formed with the cholesteric dispersion in between. Voltage pulses are then multiplexed in such a way to selectively address each pixel of the display formed by the intersection of each row and column. When a high-resolution image is addressed on the fabric and the voltage removed, the image will be retained indefinitely until readdressed to form another image.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">In carrying out the invention, it will often be desirable to employ an insulation layer or layers between the electrodes in order to insulate the conductors from each other and thereby minimize the potential for shorting. Accordingly, for purposes of the instant invention it is desirable to select materials that can be coated, printed, sprayed or otherwise laid down in a layer before and/or after the electro-optically responsive liquid crystal layer. The insulation layer must not significantly detract from the deformability or optics of the display. In accordance with the preferred embodiments of the invention, materials such as gelatin or latex are employed. Some particularly preferred insulating materials are polyurethane latex materials such as WITCOBOND W232 (available from Crompton Corporation, CT). Although an insulation layer such as gelatin is optional, experiments show that it leads to a decrease in the switching voltage on the order of 10–15 volts (f=250 Hz) when the liquid crystal layer is a cholesteric droplet dispersion. Without being bound by theory, this may be because the gelatin layer is enhancing the dielectric properties of the emulsion through the increase of the dielectric constant.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">As noted above, the use of one or more durable protective coatings obviates the need to laminate a second substrate, thereby enhancing both the flexibility and durability of the display. Desirable protective coatings will be materials that will provide a tough, scratch and ware resistant coating over at least a portion, and preferably all, of the uppermost surface of the display, but not materially interfere with the optics of the system. Likewise, the most desirable materials will maintain the deformability of the system. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select suitable materials in view of the instant disclosure. Preferred materials include acrylic or silicone paints, UV curable adhesives, PVA, latex materials and the like. Because some protective coatings will include solvents or other components which may be harmful to the electrodes or other elements of the display, in carrying out the invention it may be desirable to select an isolation layer material that will protect the other display elements from harmful components of the protective coat, or to include an additional protective material as an isolation layer interposed between the protective coat and the other display elements.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, displays according to the invention can be formed in many different configurations using some or all of the foregoing component layers. For example, the display materials may only appear on one side of the fabric leaving the other side untouched, or the display may be partially imbibed into and integrally formed with the substrate. Of course, the minimum requirements for the electrically addressable displays of the invention are the incorporation of a liquid crystal layer between a pair of conducting electrodes onto or into the substrate. Beyond this, there are multiple possible configurations and combinations which can effectively take advantage of the flexibility and/or drapability of the substrates according to the invention as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The fabrication of these display devices involves printing, coating or other deposition means to incorporate the liquid crystal material, display electrodes as well as any insulating, isolation or other coatings into or onto a substrate in a manner that will allow the display to deform with the substrate. In view of the instant disclosure those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select and employ suitable coating, printing and deposition techniques including, but not limited to, air brushing, ink jet, spin coating and spray printing, optionally in conjunction with various masks or stencils known in the art, screen printing, photolithography, chemical masking and so on, depending upon the particular substrates and display elements used. It is contemplated that any contact or non-contact method of applying coatings and conductors known in the art will be suitable for use in accordance with the instant disclosure.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">In carrying out the invention it will also be possible to prepare a display on a remote substrate and then transfer it to the desired substrate such as a drapable fabric. In this case, a sequence of multiple coatings involving droplet dispersions, conductive coatings, and any desirable insulation coatings, isolation coatings, etc. that are needed to formulate a complete display device are coated on a temporary substrate from which the coated sequence can be removed upon drying or curing. The removed film now is a display element in itself without any substrate. The display film can then be laminated onto any object or material to which electrodes can be applied for connection to drive electronics. The casting or base layer of the display film may be used for printing all or a portion of the drive electronics as the printed electronic technology permits.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">A multiple color reflective display can be fabricated by replacing the single cholesteric dispersion layer with two or more dispersion layers, each of a different reflective color layered on top of one another with conducting electrodes in between. A full color display can be made by layering red, R, green, G, and blue, B. With only one electrode layer between each color, the display is electronically addressed by a shared electrode addressing scheme possible with bistable cholesteric dispersions. Added brightness may be achieved if each of the R, G and B layers contains a stacked left twist and right twist dispersion layer. An infrared reflective display is possible where at least one of the droplet dispersion layers reflects in the infrared, such as might be used for night vision purposes. A multiple color display can also be prepared with a single dispersion layer wherein each pixel is divided into different primary colors such as red, green and blue, for additive color mixing. The patterned colors can be achieved as described, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,614, incorporated herein by reference.Sep. 16, 2004</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Still further, a self-powered display may be achieved by using a solar panel as the substrate or a component of the substrate whereby light that is not reflected by the cholesteric material can be absorbed in the solar panel for conversion into electrical power for powering the display. It is also conceived that an active matrix substrate could be employed to create an actively driven cholesteric display, whereby the various display elements are sequentially layered on the active backplane. Further still, an optically addressed display is achieved by placing a photoconductive sheet over the lower conducting electrode. With a continuous voltage applied to the electrodes, light impinging the display film will locally alter the resistivity of the photoconductor and drive the display film. Such a display construction avoids the need of patterning the electrodes. The display can be addressed by an image suitably focused on the film, or written with a scanned laser beam as described in the publication “Reflective Display with Photoconductive Layer and Bistable Reflective Cholesteric Mixture” <i>Journal of the SID</i>, Vol. 5/3, pages 269–274 (1997) by J. Yoshida et al., incorporated herein by reference. Of course, other veneered stacks are possible depending on desired display</p>
  <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0066"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref> illustrate various preferred display configurations according to the invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a profile illustration of a cholesteric reflective display on a highly drapable fabric. The display <b>100</b> is a stack of layers that are coated, printed or laminated on a fabric substrate <b>101</b> made of fibrous material. The substrate <b>101</b> may be drapable and either opaque or transparent, consisting of natural or man-made fibers. The fabric material <b>101</b> may be of woven or non-woven fibers or may be a composite such as a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic material.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">Because the surface of fabric is often very rough, it may be necessary to have a planarization layer <b>110</b>. The planarization layer may be coated, laminated or may be made to be an integral part of the fabric. In addition to at least partially smoothing out the surface, the planarization layer may serve several other purposes, such as adjusting the wetting and adhesion characteristics for the next layer of the sequence, adjusting the color, refractive index or other optical property of the film and so on. Layer <b>111</b> is a preparation layer that overlays layer <b>110</b> if more planarization is required or if <b>110</b> does not present a suitable surface for the first conducting electrode <b>120</b>. Coating is a preferred means of casting layer <b>111</b> over <b>110</b> and more than one coating may be required for unusually rough surfaces. Layer <b>111</b> may also serve as an insulating layer if the previous layer <b>110</b> is conductive. As shown, however, the next layer <b>120</b> is the first or lower conducting electrode. Normally, in the case of fabric substrates, the substrate is opaque. In this case the conducting electrode <b>120</b> can likewise be opaque, although it should not be reflective. Carbon based materials, such as conducting polymers are suitable as long at they provide sufficient conductivity; for example, less than 1000 Ohms/square resistivity, a parameter also controlled by the thickness of the layer. Carbon based materials are often desirable in that, often, they can be screen, inkjet or otherwise printed to form a desired electrode pattern.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">If printing the conducting layer is not an option, it may be coated as a continuous sheet and then subsequently patterned. For example, a conducting polymer can be first coated then patterned by printing a deactivating agent with the desired pattern over the conducting polymer. An insulating layer <b>121</b> is coated over the conducting polymer in cases where the liquid crystal layer <b>130</b> does not provide sufficient insulation between the upper conductor <b>140</b> and the lower conductor <b>120</b> to prevent shorting.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">The next layer in the sequence is the liquid crystal layer <b>130</b> which, as described above, can be a dispersion or an array of polymer walls filled with liquid crystal. As described above, a liquid crystal dispersion material can be made from any of several different processes such as, an emulsion, phase separation, or microencapsulation process. Preferred processes are dispersions prepared from latex emulsion, a PIPS phase separation or gelatin microencapsulation process as these materials can be easily coated or printed. If bistability is desired, the droplet size of the cholesteric dispersion should be large enough to allow a stable focal conic and planar texture, typically greater than 1.0 micron. The thickness of this coating determines the drive voltage of the display as well as the display brightness. To optimize brightness, it is desired that this layer be at least 4.0 microns in thickness. However, to maintain moderate to low drive voltages it is desirably less than 15 microns depending on the physical properties of the liquid crystal material. As a possible alternate to a dispersion, an array of polymer walls filled with liquid crystal can be employed, although this would require more coatings and processing.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">An isolation coating <b>131</b> is coated over the liquid crystal layer in cases where it is needed to prevent material from the second or upper conducting layer from penetrating into the liquid crystal layer. Layer <b>131</b> may also serve as an insulation layer or as a wetting and adhesion layer for the transparent or upper conducting electrode. A transparent conducting layer <b>140</b> is then printed or coated and suitably patterned to serve as the upper electrode. Transparent conducting polymers or carbon nanotubes are preferred materials suitable for this purpose. The transparency to conductivity ratio depends on the thickness of the coating. If the response speed of the display is not an issue, a resistivity as high as a few thousand Ohms/square has been found suitable to drive cholesteric dispersions. Finally, in order to improve the ruggedness of the display and to protect the display elements from the environment, the transparent conductor <b>140</b> is overlaid with a flexible protective layer <b>150</b>. The protective layer <b>150</b> may be applied in one or more layers by coating, printing, laminating or a combination thereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> there is shown an illustration of a cholesteric reflective display on a drapable fabric, where the number of layers is advantageously reduced by combining the functionality of the electrodes and planarization layers. The display  <b>200</b> is a stack of layers that are coated, printed or laminated on a fabric substrate made of fibrous or other deformable material. The substrate <b>201</b> may be a drapable fabric consisting of natural or man-made fibers which is either opaque or transparent. The fabric material may be of woven or non-woven fibers or may be a composite such as a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic material. In this embodiment, the planarization layer <b>220</b> is conductive to serve both as an electrode and a planarization layer, as well as to prepare the surface for the insulating layer <b>221</b> where needed. The conductive layer <b>220</b> may be coated, laminated or may be made to be an integral part of the fabric. The transparent conducting materials such as conducting polymers or carbon nanotubes may be printed to a suitable pattern. The conductive layer can be patterned by local deactivation with UV or printing a deactivating solution such as, for example, bleach, to locally deactivate a conducting polymer. Following a coating or printing of the insulation layer <b>221</b> the liquid crystal containing layer <b>230</b> is cast as illustrated. This layer maybe a droplet dispersion, such as a polymer dispersed cholesteric liquid crystal, or an array of confining polymer cups to hold the liquid crystalline material. The transparent conducting electrode <b>240</b> completes the electro-optic component of the display stack which is then over coated or laminated with a protective layer, <b>250</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a profile illustration of a cholesteric reflective display <b>300</b> on a flexible non-fiberous and non-transparent sheet substrate <b>301</b>, such as a thermoplastic, composite or cross-linked polymeric material. A preparation layer <b>311</b> is often required to provide improved planarization of the surface, adjust the color and light absorption of the substrate and present a suitable surface for wetting and attaching the lower conducting electrode layer <b>320</b>. A layer of cholesteric materials <b>330</b> suitably confined such as in polymer dispersion, is then cast onto the conductive layer followed by an isolation layer <b>331</b> coated over layer <b>330</b>. The isolation layer provides a surface on which to coat or print the transparent conducting electrode layer <b>340</b>, as well as to insulate from shorts and protect the liquid crystal layer. A protective layer <b>350</b> is then coated to protect the electro-optic elements below it from the environment.</p>
  <p num="p-0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a profile view of a cholesteric display <b>400</b> where the non-transparent substrate <b>401</b> is made from transparent material such as polyester (PET) or polycarbonate (PC) coated on the lower side with and ink or paint <b>402</b> to prevent light from passing through the film. The ink or paint coating is preferably black. The upper side of the transparent material contains the conducting layer <b>420</b> which, in this case, may be indium tin oxide (ITO) that is pre-coated and pre-etched. A cholesteric liquid crystal dispersion <b>430</b> then is coated over the conducting electrode layer <b>420</b> followed by a printing of the transparent electrode layer <b>440</b> and protective coating <b>450</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a three-dimensional drawing <b>500</b> of a passive matrix configuration illustrating, in an exploded view, how the conducting transparent electrodes <b>540</b> patterned as rows, are electrically connected to conducting tabs <b>542</b> attached to the substrate <b>501</b>. The column electrodes <b>520</b> are electrically connected to tabs <b>522</b>, which also are attached to the substrate <b>501</b>. The tabs are used for interconnecting drive electronics, not shown. Since the tabs for both of the columns <b>520</b> and the rows <b>540</b> are disposed on the substrate <b>501</b>, attaching the drive electronics is greatly simplify. It will be apparent that the intermediate layers of the display, including the cholesteric dispersion layer, are not shown in the exploded view.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">It will be apparent that the foregoing description in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref> is intended to illustrate the preferred cell configurations using components necessary for an electrically addressable display according to the invention. In each of the foregoing embodiments, it may be necessary or desirable to include any or all of the additional display components described above, and to coat a durable protective coat or series of coatings on top of the upper transparent conductor to insure a rugged display that is protected against the environment. Thus, although the most basic electro-optic elements of the preferred displays of the invention are a deformable substrate, a liquid crystal layer and a pair of electrodes, preferred display configurations shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1–5</figref> include planarization layers to smooth the surface of the fabric or other substrate, preparation layers that serve multiple purposes as needed to further smooth the surface, adjust the surfaces wetting and adhesion characteristics for coating the next layer in the sequence, and/or to adjust the optical characteristics needed in the display, insulation layers to prevent electrical shorts between the lower conductor and upper transparent conductor, and isolation layers as needed to prevent chemical interaction between layers or suitably adjust wetting and adhesion characteristics.</p>

  <heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading> <p num="p-0079">An operable 4×1 pixel cholesteric display was made by coating and printing the various display elements on a fabric substrate. The fabric substrate was a black woven rayon fabric (150 micron thick) coated with neoprene available from Thor Labs (Newton, N.J.). The neoprene coating served to partially planarize the fabric surface. The fabric was rinsed with the mixture of water and isopropanol (90:10%) to make the surface hydrophilic. A preparation layer of aqueous polyurethane dispersion, NeoRez R967 available from NeoResins, MA was deposited on the fabric with a Meyer rod # 8 (available from Chemsultants International, Mentor, Ohio) technique and allowed to dry at room temperature. The dry thickness of the preparation layer was approximately 10–12 microns. The preparation layer serves to further smooth the rather rough neoprene surface and to provide a chemical barrier for the next casting layer. A layer of conductive polymer (ELP-3040 available from Agfa-Gevaert, Belgium) was screen printed on the preparation layer as 4 pixels 25 mm wide, 18 mm long spaced 2 mm apart to serve as the electrodes of the passive matrix display. After coating the conducting polymer, it was cured at 100° C. for 10 minutes. The sheet resistivity of the conductive polymer layer was 800 Ω/sq. A thin insulation layer (1–2 μm) of the polyurethane dispersion NeoRez R967 was cast on the conductive layer using a doctor blade technique. A layer of encapsulated cholesteric liquid crystal in polymer binder was formed from a water-based emulsion and coated on the insulation layer using a doctor blade having a 25 micron gap and allowed to dry for 1 hour at room temperature. The thickness of encapsulated liquid crystal layer was approximately 8–10 μm. The ratio between liquid crystal and binder was from 4:1 to 5:1. The emulsion was prepared from 0.4 g of yellow CLC KLC 19 (EM Industries of Hawthorne, NY) and 0.27 g of NeoRez R967. To improve the display contrast, a small amount (0.3–0.4 wt %) of 4-hexylamino-4′-nitro-azobenzene dye was added to the liquid crystal before emulsification. The mixture was emulsified with a homogenizer (PowerGen 700) at 1000 rpm for 3–4 min at room temperature. The emulsified CLC formed droplets which are about 3–15 μm in diameter. The second conductive electrode was formed from a highly transparent conductive polymer, Dipcoat, available from Agfa. A thin layer of the conductive polymer was deposited using air brushing over a mask and cured at room temperature. The mask provided a continuous top electrode for the passive matrix display. The bistable cholesteric material could be addressed to the planar (yellow reflective) texture by application of 125 volts or to the focal conic (non-reflective texture) with application of 70 volts with frequency of 50 Hz and pulse width of 20 ms. The electro-optical curves are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The data for reflectance vs. wavelength is presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> with a contrast ratio of 12:1 and brightness of 26%.</p>

The sequence of the layers and materials are the same as in the Example 1 except that for the display protection, a clear coat of polyurethane dispersion WITCOBOND W232 (available from Crompton Corporation, CT) was deposited on the top of the second conductive electrode using a doctor blade. The use of the transparent layer of WITCOBOND W232 with thickness approximately of 5–10 microns as a clear coat allowed one to increase the transmission due to the refractive index matching.</p>

Two coatings of conductive polymers were deposited to reach desirable conductivity of the electrode. The preparation layer was coated from 5 wt % aqueous solution of Hi-Pure gelatin (available from Norland Products Inc.) using the Meyer rod #12 and dried at room temperature for 30 min.

  <heading>EXAMPLE 10</heading> <p num="p-0088">An operable 16×16 pixel passive matrix cholesteric display was made by coating and printing the various display elements on a plastic substrate. The plastic substrate was a PET sheet with thickness of 137 microns available from Teijin (Japan). In order to establish a black background for the reflective display a black paint (KRYLON) was first coated on the back side of the substrate by spraying and dried at room temperature. A layer of conductive polymer (ELP-3040 available from Agfa-Gevaert, Belgium) was screen printed on the other side of the plastic substrate as 5 mm wide, 15 cm long strips spaced lmm apart to serve as the column electrodes of the passive matrix display.

A thin insulation layer (1–2 μm) of the polyurethane dispersion WITCOBOND W232 (available from Crompton Corporation, CT) was cast on the conductive layer using a doctor blade technique. A layer of encapsulated cholesteric liquid crystal in the form of a water-based emulsion in a polymer binder was coated on the insulation layer using a doctor blade having a 25 micron gap and allowed to dry for 1 hour at room temperature.

  <heading>EXAMPLE 22</heading> <p num="p-0101">An operable cholesteric layer was fabricated on fabric using droplet dispersions by the PIPS method. The first step was to pass a piece of black rayon fabric coated with neoprene through a laminator at 100° C. and then clean it with methanol to prepare the surface. Next, a layer of conductive polymer, Agfa EL-P 3040 was screen printed onto the neoprene and cured at 130° C. for 2 minutes to form the bottom electrode. An open-face Polymerization Induced Phase Separation (PIPS) mixture consisting of 75% KCL19 cholesteric liquid crystal and 25% pre-polymer mixture was cast onto the fabric using a #12 Meyer rod. The pre-polymer mixture had the following composition: 40% 2-Ethylhexyl Methacrylate, 31% Isobomyl Methacrylate, 18% Pentafluoropropyl Acrylate, 9% Trimethylol Propane Triacrylate, and 2% Irgacure 651, the photoinitiator. The film was then irradiated for 10 minutes with UV light (ELC4001, Electro-lite Corp., 3.75 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) while contained in a clear Tupperwear container (Rubbermaid StainShield, 2.1 QT) being purged with a N<sub>2 </sub>gas stream. The purpose of the N<sub>2 </sub>stream was twofold; 1.) to enable polymerization of the acrylate monomers by purging the atmosphere with an inert gas thereby prohibiting the scavenging of radicals via O<sub>2 </sub>[K. Studer, C. Decker, E. Beck, R. Schwalm, Progress in Organic Coatings 48 92–100 (2003)], 2.) to keep the black fabric cool while undergoing high intensity UV irradiation. During the curing process, the pre-polymer mixture polymerizes causing the liquid crystal to phase separate into droplets. After curing, the film was rinsed with Isopropyl Alcohol to remove any non-encapsulated liquid crystal present on the surface. After rinsing, the sample is dried using compressed air. Finally, the surface was segmented into 3 pixels using Scotch tape (3M) strips and 5 layers of Dipcoat conductive polymer (700) were airbrushed onto the surface of the film and allowed to dry in air for 15 minutes. After drying, the tape was removed and the pixels were individually switchable. The sample was switched at 170 Volts (f=20 Hz) to the planar state and at 100 Volts (f=20 Hz) to the focal conic state. In the planar state, the maximum reflectivity is 23% at 500 nm whereas the focal conic state has a reflectivity of 8.25% at 500 nm. The sample was very flexible—easily rolling around a pencil or conforming to a rounded surface without changing the bistable liquid crystal texture.</p>
  <heading>EXAMPLE 24</heading> <p num="p-0102">An operable cholesteric layer was fabricated on the polymer planarized fabric of Example 23 using droplet dispersions by the PIPS method. The first step was to clean the neoprene pre-planarization layer that is coated on the fabric with Isopropyl Alcohol to prepare the surface. Next, a polymer planarization layer was added to smooth out the neoprene layer. The polymer planarization layer consists of a mixture of 82% 2-Ethylhexyl Methacrylate 10% Pentafluoropropyl Methacrylate, 6% Trimethylol Propane Triacrylate, and 2% Irgacure 651. If the fabric substrate is not planarized, the weave of the substrate will cause nonuniformities in the planar texture across the pixel as thin spots will switch at a lower voltage than thicker spots. A layer of conductive polymer, Agfa EL-P 3040 with 1.0% adhesion promoter (PLM158) and 0.5% wetting agent (TPR156), was screen printed through a 4-pixel mask onto the substrate and cured at 85° C. for 40 minutes to form the bottom electrode. An open-faced PIPS mixture consisting of 75% KCL19 cholesteric liquid crystal and 25% pre-polymer mixture was cast onto the fabric using a #12 Meyer rod and cured as in Example 23. After curing, the film was rinsed with Isopropyl Alcohol to remove any non-encapsulated liquid crystal present on the surface. After rinsing, the sample is dried using a N<sub>2 </sub>stream. Finally 15 layers of Dipcoat conductive polymer were airbrushed onto the surface of the PIPS film and allowed to dry in air for 15 minutes. The sample was switched at 130 Volts (f=20 Hz) to the planar state and at 60 Volts (f=20 Hz) to the focal conic state. The sample was very flexible—easily rolling around a pencil or conforming to a rounded surface without changing the bistable liquid crystal texture.</p>
  <heading>EXAMPLE 25</heading> <p num="p-0103">An operable cholesteric layer was fabricated on planarized fabric using droplet dispersions by the PIPS method in the same method as in Example 24 with the exception that an insulation layer was added between the first conductive layer and the open-faced PIPS layer. The method of preparation is identical to Example 24 up to and including the first conductive layer. In order to prevent top to bottom shorts from the bottom layer of conductive polymer to the top layer of conductive polymer, an insulation layer was applied over the first conductive layer. The insulation layer consists of a thin (˜5 micron) layer of pre-polymer (50% Bisphenol A Glycerolate Diacrylate, 48% Isopropanol, and 2% Irgacure) that is cast using a number 2.5 wire-wound rod and is UV-polymerized in a nitrogen environment for 10 minutes. The polymeric composition of the insulation layer is not that critical so long as it wets the surface of the conductive polymer and the planarization layer. The subsequent PIPS layer and remaining layers were added to the insulation layer as described in Example 24. The sample was switched at 150 Volts (f=20 Hz) to the planar state and at 70 Volts (f=20 Hz) to the focal conic state. The sample was very flexible—easily rolling around a pencil or conforming to a rounded surface without changing the bistable liquid crystal texture.</p>

To enhance the wetting of the conductive polymer to the planarization layer, a thin isolation layer was used consisting of 50% Bisphenol A Glycerolate Diacrylate, 48% Isopropanol, and 2% Irgacure. This layer was cast using a number 2.5 wire-wound rod and UV cured for 15 minutes in an N<sub>2 </sub>environment. A layer of conductive polymer, Agfa EL-P 3040, was deposited over the isolation layer by screen printing through a 4-pixel mask onto the substrate and cured at 85° C. for 40 minutes to form the bottom electrode. The remainder of the sample was prepared identically to Example 25 from the insulation layer forward. The sample was switched at 150 Volts (f=20 Hz) to the planar state and at 70 Volts (f=20 Hz) to the focal conic state.

A drape coefficient of 53% was measured for the bare fabric substrate.
