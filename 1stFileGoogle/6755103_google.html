    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to punch presses. More particularly, this invention relates to tool retainers for punch presses.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Tool retainers for punch presses are well known in the art. Typically, the retainer is a metal block that carries a tool (e.g., a punch or die). The tool held by the retainer normally extends away from the retainer block toward a workpiece (e.g., a piece of sheet metal) to be punched or formed. The retainer block is usually secured to a mounting plate of the punch press. Thus, the retainer block interconnects the tool and the press, and enables the tool to be accurately positioned.</p>
    <p>Tool retainers are preferably adapted to carry tools in a removable manner. For example, the workpiece-deforming surfaces of punches and dies wear down after repeated use. Thus, it is necessary to periodically remove such tools for sharpening. Toward this end, prior art retainers have been provided with ball locks that allow repeated removal and replacement of punches or dies. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,160,676(Richard), 2,166,559(Richard), and 3,176,998(Parker). The entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>Ball locks characteristically comprise a retainer block in which two elongated bores are formed. One of the bores is adapted to receive the shank of a punch or die. This bore typically extends from near the back wall (which is typically secured to a mounting plate of the punch press) of the retainer block to the front wall of the retainer block, where such bore opens through the front wall of the retainer block. A second bore formed in the retainer block houses a spring-biased ball. This second bore extends at an angle, relative to the axis of the shank-receiving bore, from near the back wall of the retainer block to a point of intersection with the shank-receiving bore. The second, angled bore opens into the shank-receiving bore at this intersection point.</p>
    <p>The shank of a standard ball-lock tool characteristically has a tapered recess that can be lockingly engaged by the ball in a ball lock. When the shank is operatively positioned within the shank-receiving bore, the tapered recess on the shank is aligned with the intersection point of the angled bore and the shank-receiving bore. The spring in the angled bore urges the ball toward the tapered recess on the shank. With the shank so positioned, the spring-biased ball engages the recess on the shank, thereby securely holding the tool in position. That is, the spring causes the ball to be pushed toward, and maintained in, a position where the ball is effectively trapped between the tapered recess of the shank and the interior surface of the angled bore.</p>
    <p>It would be advantageous to provide ball-lock insert assemblies adapted for mounting in customer-manufactured holder plates. That is, it would be desirable to provide discrete ball-lock inserts that could be removably mounted in openings formed in a holder plate. By providing inserts of this nature, customers could use their own holder plates and form in those plates openings adapted to receive the inserts. The customer could form any number of openings in any desired arrangement. This would allow the customer to readily manufacture holder plates configured to retain essentially any desired arrangement of tools.</p>
    <p>Inserts of this nature could be used quite advantageously in a variety of devices. For example, it is anticipated that these inserts would have particular utility in “permanent” (or “continuous”) punch presses. Permanent-type punch presses are well known in the art. These presses characteristically include a plurality of permanently-positioned punch stations, each adapted to perform a given punching or forming operation upon a workpiece that is conveyed sequentially from station to station. While the present invention is by no means limited to use with permanent-type punch presses, embodiments of this nature are expected to have particular advantage.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>One embodiment of the present invention provides a retainer assembly for a punch press. The retainer assembly comprises a holder plate of a desired thickness. The holder plate has therein formed first and second elongated openings, each extending entirely through the thickness of the holder plate. The first and second openings are adjacent and generally parallel to each other. The first opening is configured to receive the shank of a tool. The retainer assembly includes a removable ball-lock insert assembly comprising an insert body. The insert body has an axis and an elongated interior recess extending at an angle relative to the axis of the insert body. The elongated interior recess is configured to house a resiliently-biased engagement member. The insert body is configured to be received axially within the second opening in an operative position wherein one end region of the elongated interior recess opens through a sidewall of the insert body into the first opening in the holder plate.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, the invention provides a retainer assembly for a punch press. The retainer assembly comprises a holder plate having a first, workpiece-facing surface and second, rear surface. These first and second surfaces are generally opposed. The holder plate has therein formed first and second elongated openings each opening through the workpiece-facing surface of the holder plate. These first and second openings are adjacent and generally parallel to each other. The first opening is configured to receive the shank of a tool. The retainer assembly includes a ball-lock insert assembly comprising an insert body having a height that is substantially equal to the thickness of the holder plate. The insert body has an axis and an elongated interior recess extending at an angle relative to the axis of the insert body. The elongated interior recess houses a resiliently-biased engagement member. The insert body is removably mounted within the second opening (of the holder plate) in an operative position wherein one end region of the insert's elongated interior recess opens through a sidewall of the insert body into the first opening in the holder plate.</p>
    <p>In still another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a ball-lock insert assembly adapted to be removably mounted axially in a mount opening formed in a holder plate of a desired thickness. The ball-lock insert assembly comprises an insert body having an axis and an elongated interior recess extending at an angle relative to the axis of the insert body. The elongated interior recess houses a resiliently-biased engagement member. The insert body has at least one catch surface configured for securing the insert body within the mount opening in the holder plate.</p>
    <p>In a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of producing a retainer assembly. The method includes providing a ball-lock insert assembly comprising an insert body having an axis and an elongated interior recess extending at an angle relative to the axis of the insert body. The elongated interior recess is configured to house a resiliently-biased engagement member. There is provided a holder plate having a front, workpiece-facing surface and a rear surface, wherein the front and rear surfaces of the holder plate are generally opposed. There is formed in the holder plate an elongated mount opening that opens through the front, workpiece-facing surface of the holder plate. This elongated mount opening is configured to axially receive the insert body.</p>

The ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> houses a resiliently-biased engagement member <b>27</b> that is urged into engagement with the shank of the tool <b>10</b>. As is perhaps best appreciated with reference to FIG. 2, the shank <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b> has a tapered recess <b>17</b> (bounded by a depressed surface <b>15</b>) that can be engaged by the engagement member <b>27</b> of the ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p>Thus, when the tool <b>10</b> is in its operative position, the resiliently-biased engagement member <b>27</b> engages and cooperates with the tapered recess <b>15</b> on the shank <b>13</b>, so as to lock the tool <b>10</b> to the holder plate <b>22</b>. This assures that the tool <b>10</b> is retained securely and accurately in its proper position during operation. When it is desired to remove the tool <b>10</b> (e.g., for sharpening or replacement), a removal tool <b>30</b> can be used to unlock the tool <b>10</b>. As described below, this moves the engagement member <b>27</b> out of engagement with the shank <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b>, allowing the tool <b>10</b> to be removed from the holder plate <b>22</b>. Once removed, the tool <b>10</b> may be discarded, sharpened, or replaced, as desired.</p>
    <p>The construction of the retainer assembly <b>20</b> is perhaps best appreciated with reference to FIGS. 3A-3C. As noted above, the assembly <b>20</b> includes a holder plate <b>22</b> to which the tool <b>10</b> can be mounted. If so desired, the holder plate <b>22</b> can be provided by the customer. That is, customers may simply obtain their own holder plates and manufacture them to accommodate a desired number and arrangement of ball-lock insert assemblies <b>25</b>. For example, customers could use their own holder plates and form in those plates mount openings (described below) adapted to receive the ball-lock inserts of the invention. As noted above, the customer could form any number of openings in any desired arrangement. This would allow the customer to conveniently manufacture holder plates configured to retain essentially any desired arrangement of tools.</p>
    <p>This is perhaps best understood with reference to FIG. 4A, wherein there is illustrated a holder plate in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The holder plate <b>22</b> of FIG. 4A is adapted to receive up to four ball-lock insert assemblies (not shown). That is, four mount openings <b>60</b>, each with an adjacent shank-receiving opening <b>50</b>, have been formed in the holder plate <b>22</b>. The number and positioning of the mount openings <b>60</b> can, of course, be varied depending on the intended punching or forming operation.</p>
    <p>Thus, it can be appreciated that the embodiment of FIG. 4A provides a single holder plate <b>22</b> that is configured to receive a plurality of ball-lock insert assemblies (not shown). This is contrary to prior art retainer blocks of the nature shown in FIG. 4B, as these prior art blocks are provided only with a single ball lock. It can also be appreciated that the invention facilitates positioning multiple ball locks more closely together than would be possible by mounting multiple retainer blocks adjacent one another upon a punch press. For example, four tools could be mounted more closely together in the shank-receiving openings <b>50</b> of FIG. 4A than could three tools in the openings <b>150</b> of FIG. <b>4</b>B.</p>
    <p>Thus, one embodiment of the invention provides a holder plate <b>22</b> having more than one (i.e., a plurality) mount opening <b>60</b> formed therein. In this embodiment, each mount opening <b>60</b> is configured to receive a ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> of the nature described herein. One aspect of the invention provides a method wherein a single holder plate <b>22</b> is provided, and a plurality of mount openings <b>60</b> (each adapted to receive a ball-lock insert assembly) are formed in the holder plate <b>22</b>. In this embodiment, a shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> is also formed adjacent each mount opening <b>60</b>, as described below.</p>
    <p>With reference to FIGS. 3A-3C, the illustrated holder plate <b>22</b> can be seen to have generally-opposed front <b>24</b>F and rear <b>24</b>R surfaces (or “faces”). The holder plate <b>22</b> can be chosen to have any desired thickness. As can be appreciated by referring to the drawings, the front face <b>24</b>F of holder plate <b>22</b> is a workpiece-facing surface. The front <b>24</b>F and rear <b>24</b>R faces of the illustrated holder plate <b>22</b> are planar. While this is not required, it is preferable that at least the rear face <b>24</b>R be generally planar, as this face <b>24</b>R is commonly carried against a planar backing plate <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment of FIG. 3A, the retainer assembly <b>20</b> includes a backing plate <b>40</b> against which the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b> is carried. Preferably, the holder plate <b>22</b> is removably fastened to the backing plate <b>40</b>. Any desired removable fasteners can be used to attach the holder plate <b>22</b> to the backing plate <b>40</b>. For example, a number of exteriorly-threaded screw, bolts, or the like may be extended from the holder plate <b>22</b> into corresponding interiorly-threaded bores in the backing plate <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>It is less preferred to permanently attach the holder plate <b>22</b> to the backing plate <b>40</b>. However, this is an option that may be desirable in some cases. For example, this may be preferred in cases where the ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> is inserted and removed through the front face <b>24</b>F of the holder plate <b>22</b> (as would be possible in the embodiments of FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>), rather than through the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>The holder plate <b>22</b> and the backing plate <b>40</b> are typically formed of a metal or metal alloy, such as steel (e.g., high alloy-soft, high alloy-Rc 54-58, etc.), or another rigid, mechanically-durable material. The selection of suitable materials for the holder plate <b>22</b>, backing plate <b>40</b>, and other components of the retainer assembly <b>20</b> will be well within the purview of those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p>As is perhaps best appreciated with reference to FIG. 3C, the holder plate <b>22</b> has therein formed first <b>50</b> and second <b>60</b> openings that are adjacent and generally parallel to each other. As noted above, these openings are referred to respectively as the “shank-receiving opening” <b>50</b> and the “mount opening” <b>60</b>. In the embodiment of FIG. 3C, each of these openings <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> has a circular cross section. However, it will be appreciated that one or both of these openings <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> may have a non-circular cross section (e.g., square, rectangular, etc.). One exemplary embodiment of this nature is illustrated in FIG. <b>11</b>. Many variations of this nature will be apparent to skilled artisans given the present teaching as a guide.</p>
    <p>The shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> is configured to receive the shank <b>13</b> of a tool <b>10</b>. This is perhaps best appreciated by comparing FIG. 3A to FIGS. 3B and 3C. The shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> opens through the workpiece-facing wall <b>24</b>F of the holder plate <b>22</b>, and extends into the body of the plate <b>22</b>. Preferably, this opening <b>50</b> extends entirely between, and opens through both, the front <b>24</b>F and rear <b>24</b>R faces of the holder plate <b>22</b>. Accordingly, when the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b> is attached to the backing plate <b>40</b>, the backing plate <b>40</b> defines the closed rear end of the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b>. Thus, when a tool <b>10</b> is operatively positioned within the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b>, the shank <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b> is preferably bottomed-out in this opening <b>50</b>, such that the butt end (i.e., the non-tip end) of the tool <b>10</b> is in direct contact with the closed rear end (e.g., the backing plate <b>40</b>) of the shank-receiving bore <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>Tools commonly have cylindrical shanks, which are circular in cross-section. As a consequence, the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> in the holder plate <b>22</b> will commonly be an elongated bore having a cylindrical configuration, characterized by a circular cross-section. In such cases, the inner diameter <b>50</b>D (depicted in FIG. 3C) of this bore <b>50</b> is selected to correspond to (i.e., to be substantially the same as, or slightly greater than) the outer diameter of the shank <b>13</b> of the desired tool <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> can alternatively be configured to accommodate a shank having a non-circular cross section. In such cases, the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> in the holder plate <b>22</b> has inner dimensions that are selected to correspond to (i.e., to be substantially the same as, or slightly greater than) outer dimensions of the non-circular shank. For example, FIG. 11 illustrates a tool <b>10</b> and a shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> that both are rectangular in cross section.</p>
    <p>The second opening (or “mount opening”) <b>60</b> in the holder plate <b>22</b> is adapted to receive a ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b>. This is perhaps best appreciated with reference to FIG. 3A relative to FIGS. 3B and 3C. The mount opening <b>60</b> opens through the workpiece-facing wall <b>24</b>F of the holder plate. Preferably, this opening <b>60</b> extends entirely between, and opens through both, the front <b>24</b>F and rear <b>24</b>R faces of the holder plate <b>22</b>. In certain embodiments (see FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b>), the body of the ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> has a cylindrical exterior configuration. Thus, the mount opening <b>60</b> may be an elongated cylindrical bore. In such cases, the inner diameter <b>60</b>D (depicted in FIG. 3C) of the mount opening <b>60</b> is selected to correspond to (i.e., to be substantially the same as, or slightly greater than) the outer diameter of the insert <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p>It is advantageous if the mount opening <b>60</b> can be provided in the form of a cylindrical bore, having a circular cross section. This allows the mount opening <b>60</b> to be formed by a simple drilling procedure. Since the openings in the holder plate may be machined by the customer, it is preferable if each mount opening <b>60</b> can be formed by basic machining procedures, such as drilling. This can be accomplished by providing the ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> in the form of a cylinder.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the mount opening <b>60</b> can be formed so that its axis is perpendicular to the front <b>24</b>F and/or rear <b>24</b>R faces of the holder plate <b>22</b>. This allows the mount opening <b>60</b> to be formed by drilling perpendicularly into either the front <b>24</b>F or rear <b>24</b>R face of the holder plate <b>22</b>. In comparison, it can be appreciated that the manufacturing process is less than ideal for prior art retainer blocks wherein the bore for housing the spring-biased ball is drilled at an angle into the rigid, mechanically-durable block.</p>
    <p>It is particularly advantageous if the mount opening <b>60</b> can be provided in the form of a cylindrical bore extending entirely between, and opening through both, the front <b>24</b>F and rear <b>24</b>R faces of the holder plate <b>22</b>. This in particular facilitates convenient manufacturing of the holder plate <b>22</b>, as the mount bore <b>60</b> can be drilled through the holder plate <b>22</b> from either side <b>24</b>F of <b>24</b>R of the plate <b>22</b>. This is also advantageous in that when the mount opening <b>60</b> extends entirely through the holder plate <b>22</b>, it is not necessary to precisely control the depth to which this opening <b>60</b> is drilled. In comparison, a ball-lock insert adapted for mounting in a blind opening would require precise control over the depth of the blind opening to assure proper alignment of the tapered recess on the shank of the tool <b>10</b> with the engagement member <b>27</b> of the ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b>. Having to form in the holder plate <b>22</b> a blind opening of a precise depth would unnecessarily complicate the process of manufacturing the holder plate <b>22</b>, which manufacturing may be performed by the customer in certain embodiments of the present invention.</p>
    <p>In particularly preferred embodiments, the shank-receiving openings <b>50</b> and the mount openings <b>60</b> in the holder plate <b>22</b> both are cylindrical bores that extend entirely between the front <b>24</b>F and rear <b>24</b>R faces of the holder plate <b>22</b> and that have their axes oriented perpendicular to the front face <b>24</b>F and/or the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b>. This affords particularly convenient manufacturing of the holder plate <b>22</b>. As noted above, parallel cylindrical bores <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> can be drilled in the hard, mechanically-durable holder plate <b>22</b> much more easily than non-parallel bores. Moreover, when the bores <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> extend entirely through the holder plate <b>22</b>, it is not necessary to precisely control the depth of the bores.</p>
    <p>Several figures of the present disclosure illustrate embodiments wherein the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> and the mount opening <b>60</b> both are cylindrical. In these embodiments, the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> and mount opening <b>60</b> preferably intersect each another. That is, these openings <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are preferably open to each other along one side, to a partial circumferential extent. The “line” or “width” of intersection of the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> and the mount opening <b>60</b> is denoted in FIG. 3C by the reference character “I”. These openings preferably intersect to an extent less than the diameter of the smaller of the two openings <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>. That is, the intersection line I of these two openings <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> is preferably shorter than the diameter of the smaller of these two openings <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>. In the embodiment of FIG. 3C, for example, the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> has a smaller diameter <b>50</b>D than the mount opening <b>60</b>. However, this is by no means a requirement. For example, FIG. 6D depicts one embodiment of the invention wherein the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> has a larger diameter <b>50</b>D than the mount opening <b>60</b>. Of course, both openings <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> would have substantially the same inner diameter in cases where the tool shank and the ball-lock insert have substantially the same outer diameter. Thus, it can be appreciated that the intersection line I of these openings <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> is preferably less than the diameter of both openings <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>The mount opening <b>60</b> can alternatively be configured to accommodate a ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> having a non-cylindrical exterior configuration. In some cases, it may be desirable to provide a ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> that is generally square (e.g., see FIGS. 11D and 11E) or rectangular in cross section. In such cases, the mount opening <b>60</b> preferably has a corresponding non-cylindrical configuration, wherein inner dimensions of the mount opening <b>60</b> are selected to correspond to (i.e., to be substantially the same as, or slightly greater than) outer dimensions of the non-cylindrical ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p>As noted above, the retainer assembly <b>20</b> includes a removable ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b>. The ball-lock insert <b>25</b> comprises a body (the “insert body”) that has an axis A and is configured to be received axially within the mount opening <b>60</b> in the holder plate <b>22</b>. In certain embodiments, the insert body has a height (i.e., the distance from the bottom <b>82</b> to the top <b>88</b> of the insert body) that is substantially equal to the thickness of the holder plate <b>22</b>. The body of the insert <b>25</b> preferably has an exterior dimension that is slightly less than an interior dimension of the mount opening <b>60</b>, such that the insert <b>25</b> can be fitted snugly within the mount opening <b>60</b> (e.g., when the insert is in its operative position). In cases where the ball-lock insert <b>25</b> has a cylindrical configuration, the exterior diameter of the insert <b>25</b> preferably is slightly less than the interior diameter <b>60</b>D of the mount opening <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>The body of the ball-lock insert <b>25</b> defines an elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B that is configured to house a resiliently-biased engagement member <b>27</b>. This elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B defines a path of travel for the engagement member <b>27</b>. As shown in FIG. 5C, the interior recess <b>25</b>B may be an elongated cylindrical bore, although this is not a requirement. The interior recess <b>25</b>B (i.e., its axis, or the path of travel it defines) is oriented at an angle α with respect to the axis A of the insert <b>25</b>. In certain embodiments, this angle α is between about 10 degrees and about 20 degrees, perhaps optimally about 15 degrees. In other embodiments, it may be desirable to select an angle α for the elongated recess <b>25</b>B that is outside this range.</p>
    <p>It can be appreciated that when the insert <b>25</b> is operatively positioned in the mount opening <b>60</b> of the holder plate <b>22</b>, the interior recess <b>25</b>B of the insert <b>25</b> converges with the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> of the holder plate <b>22</b>. With the insert <b>25</b> so positioned, an end region of the interior recess <b>25</b>B opens through the body (e.g., through a sidewall <b>25</b>S of the body) of the insert <b>25</b> into a midpoint of the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b>. Further, when the insert <b>25</b> is operatively positioned in the mount opening <b>60</b>, the front face <b>88</b> of the insert is a workpiece-facing surface (i.e., a front-facing surface that does not have any part of the holder plate disposed over it).</p>
    <p>In the illustrated embodiments, the elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B of the insert <b>25</b> extends from an opening in the rear face <b>82</b> of the insert <b>25</b> to a seat opening <b>80</b> in the side <b>25</b>S of the insert. This seat opening <b>80</b> is preferably configured (i.e., sized and shaped) to allow a portion of the engagement member <b>27</b> to extend therethrough, so as to partially obstruct the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> in the holder plate <b>22</b>. For example, this seat opening <b>80</b> can be advantageously provided in the form of a generally tear-shaped aperture, as shown in FIGS. 5B, <b>6</b>B, and <b>7</b>B. The major dimension of such an opening <b>80</b> is its length (i.e., its dimension along an axis parallel to the axis A of the insert <b>25</b>), and the minor dimension of such an opening <b>80</b> is its width. This opening <b>80</b> preferably has a maximum width that is less than the width of the engagement member <b>27</b>.</p>
    <p>The engagement member <b>27</b> is configured to fit inside the elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B of the insert <b>25</b>. As noted above, a portion of the engagement member <b>27</b> is adapted to protrude into the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b>. Preferably, this portion of the engagement member <b>27</b> is provided with a radius. For example, the engagement member <b>27</b> may be a sphere (or “ball”), a roller, a bullet-shaped body, or the like. Thus, although the term “ball lock” is used in the present disclosure, the engagement member <b>27</b> in the ball-lock insert <b>25</b> is not required to be a ball. However, in many cases, the engagement member <b>27</b> is a ball, which may be formed of metal or the like. In such cases, the outer diameter of the ball <b>27</b> is preferably equal to, or slightly less than, the inner diameter of the elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B of the insert <b>25</b>. In one embodiment, a conventional ½ inch diameter ball bearing is used. In this embodiment, the inner diameter of the elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B should be at least ½ inch, and is more preferably between about 0.5010 inch and about 0.5020 inch.</p>
    <p>The ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> includes a biasing member <b>21</b> for urging the engagement member <b>27</b> toward the seat opening <b>80</b> at the front end of the elongated recess <b>25</b>B. Any desired biasing member <b>21</b> can be used, such as a spring, spring clip, or the like. The embodiment of FIG. 1 involves a ball <b>27</b> that is resiliently biased by a spring <b>21</b>. In this embodiment, the spring <b>21</b> is positioned between the ball <b>27</b> and the backing plate <b>40</b> of the retainer assembly <b>20</b>. A variety of other biasing members and biasing arrangements/systems are known, and can be used without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
    <p>When the ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> is in its operative position within the mount opening <b>60</b> of the holder plate <b>22</b>, the resiliently-biased engagement member <b>27</b> in the elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B is urged toward a locking position wherein it partially obstructs the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> of the holder plate <b>50</b>. This partial protrusion of the engagement member <b>27</b> into the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> provides a locking mechanism, whereby the engagement member <b>27</b> can be effectively wedged between the tapered recess <b>15</b> on the tool's shank <b>13</b> and the interior surface of the insert's elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B.</p>
    <p>In certain preferred embodiments, the ball-lock insert <b>25</b> includes at least one catch surface configured for securing the insert <b>25</b> within the mount opening <b>60</b> of the holder plate <b>22</b>. As noted above, the mount opening <b>60</b> preferably opens through both walls <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b>. Thus, it will typically be desirable to secure the insert <b>25</b> in the mount opening <b>60</b> during operation. Toward this end, the invention provides inserts having a number of different types of catch surfaces.</p>
    <p>In certain embodiments, the catch surface <b>84</b> on the insert body is defined by a shoulder integral to the insert body. As shown in FIGS. 1, <b>3</b>A, <b>5</b>, and <b>11</b>C, this shoulder may be defined by an oversized base <b>83</b> of the insert body, which oversized base has a greater outer diameter than the rest of the insert <b>25</b>. The mount opening <b>60</b> in this embodiment is formed so as to have a corresponding interior configuration with an enlarged end region <b>63</b>. Preferably, the enlarged end region <b>63</b> of the mount opening <b>60</b> has an inner diameter that is substantially the same as, or slightly greater than, the outer diameter of the oversized base <b>83</b> of the insert <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, the catch surface on the insert body is provided by a slot <b>87</b> that is adapted to receive a retaining ring <b>187</b>. Embodiments of this nature are shown in FIGS. 6 and 9. In still other embodiments, the insert body has a reduced-diameter front end portion <b>86</b>, such that a shoulder is defined by the full-diameter base portion of the insert body. As is perhaps best appreciated with reference to FIG. 7, this shoulder defines a catch surface <b>85</b> that is configured for securing the insert body within the mount opening <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>When the ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> is operatively positioned in the mount opening <b>60</b>, the front face <b>88</b> of the insert <b>25</b> preferably lies generally flush with the front face <b>24</b>F of the holder plate <b>22</b>, although this is by no means a requirement. In certain embodiments, when the insert <b>25</b> is located in the mount opening <b>60</b>, the front <b>88</b> and rear <b>82</b> faces of the insert <b>25</b> lie flush with the front <b>24</b>F and rear <b>24</b>R faces of the holder plate <b>22</b>, respectively. This is perhaps best understood with reference to FIG. <b>3</b>. In other embodiments, the front face <b>88</b> of the operatively-positioned insert <b>25</b> is offset below or above the workpiece-facing surface <b>24</b>F of the holder plate <b>22</b>. In such embodiments, it is preferable that the front face <b>88</b> of the insert <b>25</b> be readily accessible from the front of the holder plate <b>22</b>. For example, a major portion of the insert's front face <b>88</b> is preferably exposed at the front of the holder plate <b>22</b>. In other words, substantially the entire front face <b>88</b> of the insert is preferably a workpiece-facing surface, which is not concealed beneath any portion of the holder plate <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>The body of the insert <b>25</b> preferably defines at least one access opening <b>29</b> into which a removal tool <b>30</b> can be inserted. Preferably, the access opening <b>29</b> has an elongated length extending through the insert body and into the elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B of the insert body. That is, the access opening <b>29</b> preferably extends between the front face <b>88</b> of the insert <b>25</b> and the interior recess <b>25</b>B of the insert body. The front-most length of the access opening <b>29</b> is preferably defined by the insert body. In fact, the entire length of the access opening <b>29</b> is preferably bounded on all sides by the body of the insert body. This is preferable as it allows customers to machine mount openings <b>60</b> without also having to form access openings in the holder plate <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 5A-5C depict one ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> that can be used in connection with the present invention. The body of the insert <b>25</b> defines an elongated interior recess <b>25</b>B, has a tear-shaped seat opening <b>80</b>, and generally has the same features as have been described. The insert <b>25</b> in this embodiment has an oversized base <b>83</b> that provides a catch surface <b>84</b> to facilitate positioning the insert <b>25</b> within the mount opening <b>60</b> of the holder plate <b>22</b>. This oversized base <b>83</b> has a greater outer diameter than the rest of the insert <b>25</b>. The mount opening <b>60</b> in this embodiment has a corresponding interior configuration with an enlarged end region <b>63</b>. This enlarged end region <b>63</b> has an inner diameter that is substantially the same as, or slightly greater than, the outer diameter of the oversized base <b>83</b> of the insert <b>25</b>. As is perhaps best appreciated with reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B, when an insert <b>25</b> of this nature is placed into the opening <b>60</b> in the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b>, the insert <b>25</b> can only be advanced to the point where its front face <b>88</b> is flush with the front face <b>24</b>F of the holder plate <b>22</b>. At this point, the catch surface <b>84</b> defined by the shoulder of the oversized base <b>83</b> engages a confronting surface <b>64</b> of the holder plate <b>22</b>, which confronting surface <b>64</b> bounds the enlarged end region <b>63</b> of the mount opening <b>60</b>. The rear face <b>82</b> of the thus positioned insert <b>25</b> is then flush with the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b>. As shown in FIG. 3A, the insert <b>25</b> can be secured in this position by attaching the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b> to the backing plate <b>40</b>, as described above.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 6A-6C depict another ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> of the invention. Rather than having an enlarged base region to facilitate correct positioning of the insert), this particular insert <b>25</b> has a catch surface provided by a narrow circumferentially-extending groove (or “slot”) <b>87</b>. This slot <b>87</b> is adapted to receive a small retaining ring <b>187</b> having an outer diameter that is greater than the maximum outer diameter of the insert <b>25</b>. This retaining ring <b>187</b> may take the form of a generally “C”-shaped clip that can be positioned in the slot <b>87</b> on the insert <b>25</b>. As seen in FIG. 6D, the mount opening <b>60</b> in this embodiment has a corresponding interior configuration with an enlarged end region <b>63</b>. This enlarged end region <b>63</b> of the mount opening <b>60</b> has an inner diameter that is substantially the same as, or slightly greater than, the outer diameter of the retaining ring <b>187</b>. Thus, when the insert <b>25</b> is placed into the mount opening <b>60</b> through the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b>, the insert <b>25</b> can only be advanced to the point where its front face <b>88</b> is flush with the front face <b>24</b>F of the holder plate <b>22</b>. At this point, the retaining ring <b>187</b> engages a confronting surface <b>64</b> of the holder plate <b>22</b>, which confronting surface <b>64</b> bounds the enlarged region <b>63</b> of the mount opening <b>60</b>. The rear face <b>82</b> of the thus positioned insert <b>25</b> is then flush with the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b>, and can be secured in this position by attaching the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b> to the backing plate <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 7A-7C depict another ball-lock insert assembly <b>25</b> that can be used in connection with the present invention. The body of the insert in this embodiment has a reduced-diameter front end portion <b>86</b> that defines a catch surface <b>85</b> to facilitate proper positioning of the insert <b>25</b> within the mount opening <b>60</b>. As seen in FIG. 7D, at least one insert-retaining fastener <b>90</b> is anchored in the holder plate <b>22</b> adjacent the mount opening <b>60</b>. An enlarged head portion <b>91</b> of the fastener <b>90</b> engages the catch surface <b>85</b> of the insert <b>25</b>. Thus, engagement of the catch surface <b>85</b> and the fastener <b>90</b> keeps the insert <b>25</b> retained in its intended position. In this embodiment, it can be appreciated that the front face <b>88</b> of the operatively-positioned insert <b>25</b> is flush with the front face <b>24</b>F of the holder plate <b>22</b>, while the rear face <b>82</b> of the insert <b>25</b> is flush with the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b>. As noted above, the insert <b>25</b> can be secured in this position by attaching the rear face <b>24</b>R of the holder plate <b>22</b> against the backing plate <b>40</b>, so as to trap the insert <b>25</b> between the enlarged head portion <b>91</b> of the fastener <b>90</b> and the backing plate <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>In embodiments like that depicted in FIG. 7D, any type and number of insert-retaining fasteners <b>90</b> can be used. For example, the fastener <b>90</b> can be an exteriorly-threaded bolt, screw, or the like anchored in an interiorly-threaded opening formed in the holder plate <b>22</b> just beyond the perimeter of the mount opening <b>60</b>. It may be preferable to position a plurality of fasteners <b>90</b> about the perimeter of the mount opening <b>60</b>. Good results have been achieved, for example, using two diametrically-opposed bolts <b>90</b>. In the embodiment of FIG. 7D, the fastener <b>90</b> is provided with a countersink such that the head portion <b>91</b> of the fastener <b>90</b> is recessed just below the front face <b>24</b>F of the holder plate <b>22</b>. It may also be desirable to use one or more dowel pins <b>190</b>, alone or in combination with other fasteners, to locate the insert <b>25</b> in the mount opening <b>60</b>. One embodiment of this nature is illustrated in FIG. <b>8</b>. Given the present teaching as a guide, skilled artisans would recognize a number of other fastening arrangements that could be used.</p>
    <p>As noted above, the front face <b>88</b> of the insert <b>25</b> preferably defines one or more access openings <b>29</b> that facilitate unlocking the ball-lock device and removing the tool <b>10</b>. The insert <b>25</b> can have a number of different access opening configurations. FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment wherein the insert <b>25</b> is provided with two access openings <b>29</b>A, <b>29</b>B. FIGS. 3A, <b>6</b>D, <b>7</b>D, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B illustrate embodiments wherein only a single access opening <b>29</b> is provided. Generally speaking, each access opening <b>29</b> will be either an angled opening <b>29</b>A or a vertical opening <b>29</b>B. Angled access openings <b>29</b>A are particularly advantageous when an oversized punch <b>210</b> (see FIG. 9B) is used. As illustrated in FIG. 5C, the angled openings <b>29</b>A can be oriented at an angle β (see FIG. 5C) with respect to the axis A of the ball-lock insert <b>25</b>. This angle β may, for example, be on the order of about 25 degrees. Thus, it will be appreciated that the insert <b>25</b> can be provided with both a vertical access opening <b>29</b>B and an angled access opening <b>29</b>A, as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. Alternatively, the insert <b>25</b> can be provided with a single access opening <b>29</b> of either of the described types (i.e., angled <b>29</b>A or vertical <b>29</b>B).</p>
    <p>The access openings <b>29</b>A, <b>29</b>B can have any desired size and shape. In many cases, each access opening <b>29</b> will have an elongated cylindrical configuration, with a circular cross section. An opening of this nature may, for example, have a diameter on the order of about ⅛ inch. Of course, the dimensions of a given access opening <b>29</b> can be varied as desired. As noted above, the entire length of the access opening <b>29</b> is preferably bounded by the insert <b>25</b> alone. For example, the holder plate <b>22</b> preferably does not conceal, or form, any partial length of the access opening <b>29</b>.</p>
    <p>Essentially any rigid elongated member can be used as a removal tool with the present ball-lock insert assemblies. For example, a rod or any other elongated member of appropriate size, shape, and rigidity may be used. Preferably, the elongated member has a length with an exterior dimension (e.g., diameter) that is small enough to be inserted into an access opening <b>29</b> of the desired insert <b>25</b>. Conjointly, the length of the elongated member should be great enough to extend from the front face <b>24</b>F of the insert <b>25</b> to the interior recess <b>25</b>B of the insert <b>25</b>, to contact the engagement member <b>27</b>, and to move the engagement <b>27</b> out of its locking position with the shank <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b>. The elongated member (i.e., the removal tool) is preferably rigid enough to push the engagement member <b>27</b> out of its locking position against the opposing force of the biasing member <b>21</b>.</p>
    <p>The configuration of each access opening <b>29</b> in a given insert <b>25</b> may be selected to accommodate use of a desired removal tool <b>30</b>. For example, FIG. 10 illustrates one possible removal tool <b>30</b> comprising a handle <b>35</b> and an elongated shaft <b>33</b> that extends from the handle <b>35</b> and defines a distal tip <b>31</b>. In one embodiment, the handle <b>35</b> and shaft <b>33</b> of the removal tool <b>30</b> are integrally constructed of a single piece of metal (e.g., steel). It will be appreciated that the outer dimension of the shaft <b>33</b> is preferably sized to fit within each access opening <b>29</b> of the desired ball-lock insert <b>25</b>. In one embodiment, the shaft <b>33</b> of the removal tool <b>30</b> has a diameter of about {fraction (4/9)} inch and each access opening has a diameter of about ⅛ inch. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to use with any particular type of removal tool. Rather, any means for moving the engagement member out of engagement with the shank <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b> can be utilized.</p>
    <p>The retainer assembly <b>20</b> can be attached to a mounting plate (not shown) of a punch press in any desired manner. A number of methods are well known for this attachment to a punch press. For example, it is known to use a series of dowel pins for this purpose. Alternatively, a series of cap screws can be used. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,103,845 and 5,284,069, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>It is particularly advantageous to mount the present retainer assembly <b>20</b> to a permanent-type punch press. As noted above, permanent-type punch presses characteristically include a plurality of permanently-positioned punch stations, each adapted to perform a given punching operation upon a workpiece that is conveyed sequentially from station to station. Thus, one embodiment of the invention provides a permanent-type punch press to which is mounted a retainer assembly <b>20</b> of the nature described herein.</p>
    <p>Use of the present retainer assembly <b>20</b> is perhaps best understood with reference to FIGS. 1, <b>9</b>A, and <b>9</b>B. With the insert assembly <b>25</b> in its operative position within the mount opening <b>60</b> of the holder plate <b>22</b>, the shank <b>13</b> of a tool <b>10</b> is inserted into the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> of the holder plate <b>22</b>. Thus, the diameter of the shank <b>13</b> may be smaller than that of the ball-lock insert <b>25</b> (e.g., in the embodiments of FIGS. 1, <b>3</b>A, <b>7</b>D, and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B) or larger than that of the ball-lock insert <b>25</b> (e.g., in the embodiments of FIGS. <b>6</b>D and <b>8</b>). The tool <b>10</b> may be a “standard” punch (as in the embodiments of FIGS. 1, <b>3</b>A, <b>6</b>D, <b>7</b>D, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>A), an “oversized” punch (as in the embodiment of FIG. <b>9</b>B), or any other type of punch, die, or the like.</p>
    <p>As the shank <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b> is inserted into the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b> in the holder plate <b>22</b>, the tapered recess <b>17</b> on the shank <b>13</b> is moved toward alignment with the resiliently-biased engagement member <b>27</b>. As noted above, the shank <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b> has a depressed surface <b>15</b> that defines the tapered recess <b>17</b>. Thus, when the butt end <b>11</b> of the shank <b>13</b> contacts the closed rear end (e.g., the backing plate <b>40</b>) of the shank-receiving opening <b>50</b>, the resiliently-biased engagement member <b>27</b> is urged into this recess <b>17</b> and against the depressed surface <b>15</b> on the shank <b>13</b>. The engagement member <b>27</b> is thus lockingly engaged with the shank <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b>. This constitutes the operative position of the tool, and punching and forming operations are performed while the tool <b>10</b> is secured in this position.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 9A, when it is desired to remove the tool <b>10</b>, the tip <b>31</b> of a removal tool <b>30</b> is inserted through an access opening <b>29</b> in the ball-lock insert <b>25</b> and into engagement with the resiliently-biased engagement member <b>27</b>. By continuing to advance the removal tool <b>30</b>, the engagement member <b>27</b> is urged away from the shank <b>13</b> of the tool <b>10</b>, thereby compressing the biasing member <b>21</b> and moving the engagement member <b>27</b> out of engagement with the tapered recess <b>17</b> on the shank <b>13</b>, as illustrated in FIG. <b>9</b>B. The tool <b>10</b> can then be removed from the retainer assembly <b>20</b>, and discarded, sharpened, or replaced, as desired.</p>
    <p>While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, it should be understood that a variety of changes, adaptations, and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.</p>
