    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention relates to a method for making an emulsion using microchannel process technology.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0004">Emulsions may be formed when two or more immiscible liquids, usually water or a water-based solution and a hydrophobic organic liquid (e.g., an oil), are mixed so that one liquid forms droplets in the other liquid. Either of the liquids can be dispersed in the other liquid. When, for example, oil is dispersed in water, the emulsion may be referred to as an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. The reverse case is a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. More complex emulsions such as double emulsions may be formed when, for example, water droplets in a continuous oil phase themselves contain dispersed oil droplets. These oil-in-water-in-oil emulsions may be identified as o/w/o emulsions. In the same manner a w/o/w emulsion may be formed.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">A problem with many emulsions is that if they are not stabilized, for example, by adding surfactants or emulsifiers, they tend to agglomerate, form a creaming layer, coalesce, and finally separate into two phases. If a surfactant or emulsifier (sometimes referred to as a surface-active agent) is added to one or both of the immiscible liquids, one of the liquids may form a continuous phase and the other liquid may remain in droplet form (“dispersed or discontinuous phase”), the droplets being dispersed in the continuous phase. The degree of stability of the emulsion may be increased when droplet size is decreased below certain values. For example, a typical o/w emulsion of a droplet size of 20 microns may be only temporally stable (hours) while that of one micron may be considered as “quasi-permanently” stable (weeks or longer). However, the energy consumption and the power requirement for the emulsification system and process may be significantly increased for smaller droplet sizes when using conventional processing techniques, especially for highly viscous emulsions with very small droplet sizes and large outputs. For example, the doubling of energy dissipation (energy consumption) may cause a reduction of average droplet size of only about 25% when using conventional processing techniques. Shear force may be applied to overcome the interfacial tension force and in turn to break larger droplets into smaller ones. However, as the droplet size decreases, the interfacial tension required to keep the droplet shape tends to increase. Energy consumption may take place in various forms, for example, it can be the energy needed by the stirrer to overcome shear force of the emulsion in a batch process, the energy for heating and cooling, and/or the power to overcome pressure drop in a continuous process such as in a homogenizer. Heating is often needed for emulsification when one of the phases does not flow or flows too slowly at room temperature. A heated emulsion typically has lower stability, however, due to lower viscosity of the continuous phase and in turn less drag. Drag may be necessary to stop or resist the motion of the droplets and in turn the coalescence into larger and often undesired droplets or aggregates of droplets as well as phase separation into layers. After emulsification, droplets tend to rise by buoyancy. As such, an immediate cooling down may be needed, which also consumes energy.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">A problem with many of the processes that are currently available for making emulsions is that the range of compositions that are feasible for formulating product are constrained. For example, a problem with many of the emulsions that are currently available relates to the presence of surfactants or emulsifiers in their formulations. These surfactants or emulsifiers may be required to stabilize the emulsions, but may be undesirable for many applications. For example, heating without bubbling or boiling is often desired in emulsification processes, however in some instances the onset temperature of nucleate boiling or air bubble formation from dissolved air in the continuous phase may lower when surfactants or emulsifiers are present. Boiling may cause unwanted property changes. Air bubbles may cause creaming and other undesired features.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Emulsions that have low surfactant or emulsifier concentrations or are free of such surfactants or emulsifiers are often desirable for skin care products in the cosmetic industry. A disadvantage with some surfactants or emulsifiers is their tendency to interact with preservatives, such as the esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, used in skin care products. Skin irritation is another problem often associated with the use of surfactants or emulsifiers. Many adverse skin reactions experienced by consumers from the use of cosmetics may be related to the presence of the surfactants or emulsifiers. Another example relates to the problem with using surfactants or emulsifiers wherein water proofing is desired. For example, in water-based skin care products such as sunscreen, the active ingredient may not be waterproof due to the presence of water-soluble surfactants or emulsifiers.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">A problem relating to the use of many pharmaceutical compounds relates to the fact that they are insoluble or poorly soluble in water and there are limitations as to the surfactants or emulsifiers that can be used. This has resulted in the discovery of drugs that are not clinically acceptable due to problems relating to transporting the drugs into the body. Emulsion formulation problems may be problematic with drugs for intravenous injection and the administration of chemotherapeutic or anti-cancer agents.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p num="p-0009">The present invention, at least in one embodiment, may provide a solution to one or more of the foregoing problems.

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0057">The term “microchannel” refers to a channel having at least one internal dimension (for example, width, height, diameter, etc.) of up to about 50 millimeters (mm), and in one embodiment up to about 10 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 5 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 2 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 1 mm. In one embodiment, this internal dimension may be in the range of about 0.05 to about 50 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 10 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 5 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 2 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 1.5 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 1 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 0.75 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 0.5 mm. This internal dimension may be perpendicular to the direction of flow through the microchannel.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">The term “adjacent” when referring to the position of one channel relative to the position of another channel means directly adjacent such that a wall separates the two channels. This wall may vary in thickness. However, “adjacent” channels are not separated by an intervening channel that would interfere with heat transfer between the channels.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">The term “immiscible” refers to one liquid not being soluble in another liquid or only being soluble to the extent of up to about 1 milliliter per liter at 25° C.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">The term “water insoluble” refers to a material that is insoluble in water at 25° C., or soluble in water at 25° C. up to a concentration of about 0.1 gram per liter.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">The terms “upstream” and “downstream” refer to positions within the channels, including microchannels, used in the inventive process that are relative to the direction of flow of liquid through the channels. For example, a position within a channel not yet reached by a portion of a liquid flowing through that channel toward that position would be downstream of that portion of the liquid. A position within a channel already passed by a portion of the liquid flowing through that channel away from that position would be upstream of that portion of the liquid. The terms “upstream” and “downstream” do not necessarily refer to a vertical position since the channels used in the inventive process may be oriented horizontally, vertically, or at an inclined angle.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">The inventive process will be initially described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the inventive process may be conducted using emulsion forming unit <b>100</b> which comprises process microchannel <b>110</b> which has opposite sidewalls <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, and an apertured section <b>140</b> in sidewall <b>112</b>. The apertured section <b>140</b> may be referred to as a porous section or porous substrate. The apertured section <b>140</b> may comprise a sheet or plate <b>142</b> having an array of apertures <b>144</b> extending through it. Adjacent to the sidewall <b>112</b> is liquid channel <b>170</b> which opens to process microchannel <b>110</b> through apertured section <b>140</b>. The process microchannel <b>110</b> has non-apertured or non-porous regions <b>111</b> and <b>117</b>, and mixing zone <b>113</b>. The non-apertured region <b>111</b> extends from the entrance to the process microchannel to the entrance to the mixing zone <b>113</b>. The non-apertured region <b>111</b> is upstream of the mixing zone <b>113</b>. The mixing zone <b>113</b> is adjacent to the apertured section <b>140</b>. The non-apertured region <b>117</b> extends from the end of mixing zone <b>113</b> to the exit of the process microchannel <b>110</b>. The non-apertured region <b>117</b> is downstream of the mixing zone <b>113</b>. Adjacent to sidewall <b>114</b> is heat exchange channel <b>190</b>. In operation, a first liquid flows into process microchannel <b>110</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>116</b>, and through the non-apertured region <b>111</b> into the mixing zone <b>113</b>. A second liquid flows into liquid channel <b>170</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>172</b>, and then flows through apertured section <b>140</b>, as indicated by directional arrows <b>174</b>, into the mixing zone <b>113</b>. In mixing zone <b>113</b>, the second liquid contacts and mixes with the first liquid to form an emulsion. The second liquid may form a discontinuous phase within the first liquid. The first liquid may form a continuous phase. The emulsion flows from the mixing zone <b>113</b> through the non-apertured region <b>117</b> and out of the process microchannel <b>110</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>118</b>. The emulsion may be a water-in-oil emulsion or an oil-in-water emulsion. Heating or cooling may be optional. When heating or cooling is desired, heat exchange fluid flows through the heat exchange channel <b>190</b>, as indicated by directional arrows <b>192</b>, and heats or cools the liquids in the process microchannel <b>110</b> and liquid channel <b>170</b>. The degree of heating or cooling may vary over the length of the process microchannel <b>110</b> and liquid channel <b>170</b>. The heating or cooling may be negligible or non-existent in some sections of the process microchannel and liquid channel, and moderate or relatively high in other sections. Alternatively, the heating or cooling can be effected using other than a heat exchange fluid. For example, heating can be effected using an electric heating element. The electric heating element can be used to form one or more walls of the process microchannel <b>110</b> and/or liquid channel <b>170</b>. The electric heating can be built into one or more walls of the process microchannel <b>110</b> and/or liquid channel <b>170</b>. Cooling can be effected using a non-fluid cooling element. Multiple heating or cooling zones may be employed along the length of the process microchannel <b>110</b>. Similarly, multiple heating fluids at different temperatures may be employed along the length of the process microchannel <b>110</b> and/or liquid channel <b>170</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">The emulsion forming unit <b>100</b>A illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is identical to the emulsion forming unit <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the exception that the sidewall <b>114</b> of process microchannel <b>110</b> includes tapered section <b>120</b> which is aligned opposite apertured section <b>140</b>. Tapered section <b>120</b> reduces the width or height of the process microchannel <b>110</b> in the mixing zone <b>113</b>, and thus provides a restricted cross section for the process microchannel <b>110</b> in the mixing zone <b>113</b>. The width or height may be in the range from about 0.001 to about 5 mm, and in one embodiment from about 0.01 to about 2 mm. The presence of tapered section <b>120</b> provides for an increase in the velocity of the liquid flowing through the mixing zone <b>113</b>. The increased velocity of the liquid flowing through the mixing zone <b>113</b> results in an increased shear force acting on the second fluid flowing through apertures <b>144</b> into the mixing zone <b>113</b>. This facilitates the flow of the second liquid through the apertures <b>144</b> into the mixing zone <b>113</b>. The velocity of liquid flowing through the restricted cross section of the process microchannel <b>110</b> adjacent to the tapered section <b>120</b> may be in the range from about 0.005 to about 50 m/s, and in one embodiment from about 0.01 to about 50 m/s.</p>

    <p num="p-0071">In one embodiment, multiple emulsion formulations and/or sets of processing conditions may be used to generate distinct emulsions within a single microchannel mixer.

This type of mixer can be referred to as a combinatorial-synthesis device. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> wherein emulsion forming unit <b>500</b> is illustrated. Emulsion forming unit <b>500</b> employs four process microchannels and as a result may be capable of generating up to four distinct emulsions. The emulsion forming unit <b>500</b> can be repeated any desired number of times, for example, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, etc., to provide for the possibility of the multiple distinct emulsions indicated above.

The difference between the second liquid entering liquid channel <b>550</b> and the second liquid entering liquid channel <b>560</b> may be based on composition or processing conditions, physical properties (e.g., viscosity, density, surface tension, etc.) and/or operating parameters.

In the mixing zones <b>515</b>, <b>525</b>, <b>535</b> and <b>545</b> the second liquids contact and mix with the first liquids to form the emulsions. The emulsions formed in mixing zones <b>515</b>, <b>525</b>, <b>535</b> and <b>545</b> can be the same or different. If different the emulsions may differ from one another with respect to composition and/or physical properties or operating parameters (e.g., composition of the dispersed and/or continuous phase, particle size, particle size distribution, viscosity, density, surface tension, temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc.). The emulsions formed in each of the process microchannels <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> and <b>540</b> may be water-in-oil emulsions, oil-in-water emulsions, or combinations thereof. For example, the emulsion formed in process microchannel <b>510</b> may be a water-in-oil emulsion while the emulsions formed in process microchannels <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> and/or <b>540</b> may be oil-in-water emulsions, etc. Other combinations and permutations on which emulsions are water-in-oil and which are oil-in-water are possible. The emulsions flow from mixing zones <b>515</b>, <b>525</b>, <b>535</b> and <b>545</b> through non-apertured sections <b>516</b>, <b>526</b>, <b>536</b> and <b>546</b> out of the process microchannels <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> and <b>540</b>, as indicated by directional arrows <b>518</b>, <b>528</b>, <b>538</b> and <b>548</b>, respectively. Heating or cooling using heat exchange channels <b>570</b> and <b>580</b> may be optional. When heating or cooling is desired, heat exchange fluid flows through heat exchange channels <b>570</b> and <b>580</b>, as indicated by directional arrows <b>571</b> and <b>572</b>, and <b>581</b> and <b>582</b>, and heats or cools the liquid in the channels <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>, <b>550</b> and <b>560</b>. The degree of heating or cooling may vary over the length of each of the channels. The heating or cooling may be negligible or non-existent in some sections of the process channels and/or liquid channels, and moderate or relatively high in other sections. An advantage of this embodiment of the invention is that it may provide for the forming and evaluating of multiple product emulsions at the same time using the same apparatus. This can be advantageous when it is desired to screen multiple formulations as potential new products.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">Although only one emulsion forming unit is fully illustrated in each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, there is practically no upper limit to the number of emulsion forming units that may be used in a microchannel mixer for conducting the inventive process. For example, one, two, three, four, five, six, eight, ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, hundreds, one thousand, thousands, ten thousand, tens of thousands, one hundred thousand, hundreds of thousands, millions, etc., of the emulsion forming units described above may be used. In one embodiment, each emulsion forming unit may be manifolded. Manifolding may be effected by connecting macrotubing, piping or ducting to each unit. Alternatively, many of the emulsion forming units may be internally manifolded within a microchannel mixer containing the emulsion forming units by creating relatively equal pressure drop circuits between each unit. On the other hand, the pressure drop may not be equal between each unit, as some flow maldistribution may not affect product quality. In one embodiment, up to about a 50% flow maldistribution may be acceptable in forming an emulsion using the inventive process. The process microchannels, and associated liquid channels and heat exchange channels may be aligned side-by-side or stacked one above another. For the emulsion forming units <b>100</b> and <b>10</b>A, for example, the process microchannels <b>110</b> may be aligned in parallel in one plane, the liquid channels <b>170</b> may be aligned in parallel in an adjacent plane on one side of the process microchannels <b>110</b>, and the heat exchange channels <b>190</b> may be aligned in parallel in another plane on the other side of the process microchannels <b>110</b>. For the emulsion forming units <b>100</b>B and <b>100</b>C, for example, the process microchannels <b>110</b> may be aligned in parallel in one plane, the liquid channels <b>170</b> and <b>170</b> <i>a </i>may be aligned in parallel in adjacent planes on each side of the process microchannels <b>110</b>, and the heat exchange channels <b>190</b> may be aligned in parallel in a plane adjacent to the liquid channels <b>170</b> <i>a</i>. For the emulsion forming unit <b>100</b>D, the liquid channels <b>170</b> may be aligned in parallel in one plane, the process microchannels <b>110</b> and <b>110</b> <i>a </i>may be aligned in parallel in adjacent planes on each side of the liquid channels <b>170</b>, and the heat exchange channels <b>190</b> may be aligned in parallel in a plane adjacent to the process microchannel <b>110</b>. These emulsion forming units may have appropriate headers, footers, manifolds, valves, conduit lines, tubings, control mechanisms, etc., to control the input and output of process liquids and heat exchange fluids which are not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> and <b>33</b>, but can be provided by those skilled in the art. For example, at the inlet and outlet to the microchannel mixer containing the emulsion forming units, sloped headers and footers may be used for connecting the conduit lines or tubings to avoid unnecessary pressure drops associated with the size of the process microchannels. The use of emulsion forming unit <b>100</b>D in a microchannel mixer is further illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref> discussed below.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">In one embodiment, a plurality of emulsion forming units (<b>100</b>, <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>D, <b>400</b> or <b>500</b>) may be stacked one above another to form a core of units scaled up for on-demand large capacity. The scaled-up units may have sloped headers and footers as manifolds for the liquids used to form the emulsions as well as for the emulsion products. More uniform flow distribution may also be enhanced by the addition of an orifice plate or other apertured zone at the entrance of the process or dispersed phase or heat exchange channels. Frame sections may be used to hold and seal the emulsion forming units.</p>

    <p num="p-0080">In one embodiment, the process microchannels (<b>110</b>, <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>410</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>), liquid channels (<b>170</b>, <b>170</b> <i>a</i>, <b>420</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>450</b>, <b>550</b>, <b>560</b>) and heat exchange channels (<b>190</b>, <b>570</b>, <b>580</b>) have square or rectangular cross sections and are formed from parallel spaced sheets or plates. These channels may be aligned in side-by-side vertically oriented interleaved planes, or horizontally oriented interleaved planes stacked one above another. These configurations, which may be referred to as parallel plate configurations, have a number of advantages. In comparison with circular tubes, for example, parallel plate configurations incur less pressure drop while the same shear force is realized for the height or width, or diameter at the same continuous phase mass flux. When the aspect ratio of a rectangular channel approaches, for example, about 10, i.e., approaches a parallel sheet or plate configuration, its pressure drop may be only about 50% of that in a circular channel under the same conditions. Process microchannels, liquid channels and heat exchange channels having parallel plate configurations can be easily arranged in a compact device for scale-up. Also, a higher capacity per unit volume for the emulsion forming process can be achieved with parallel plate configurations as compared with circular tubes.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">An advantage of using parallel plate configurations is that these configurations have larger fluid/wall material ratios as compared to circular tubes, and are thus more compact with the potential for higher capacity or output. A comparison may be made at the same velocity (thus, similar shear force and droplet size) and the same dimensions d, D, L and W as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The comparison results are: continuous phase flow rate G<sub>tube</sub>=Dπ/[8(D+d)]G<sub>plate</sub>. When D=d, then G<sub>tube</sub>=0.196 G<sub>plate</sub>. When d=D/2 then G<sub>tube</sub>=0262G<sub>plate</sub>. This means that for the same flow rate/capacity and system volume, the tube inner diameter has to increase by a factor of (1/0.196)<sup>0.55</sup>=2.25 times or (1/0.262)<sup>0.5</sup>=1.954 times. However, an increase of tube diameter leads to much lower shear force and in turn larger droplet size. In this case, the packing density becomes lower as the emulsification area has the following relation: when D=d, then A<sub>tube</sub>=0.39A<sub>plate</sub>; when d=D/2, then A<sub>tube</sub>=0.52A <sub>plate</sub>.</p>

The porous material may be made from powder or particulates so that the average inter-pore distance is similar to the average pore size. When very small pore sizes are used, the inter-pore distance may also be very small and the droplets may merge at the surface in the side of process microchannels (<b>110</b>, <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>210</b>, <b>410</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>) or liquid channels (<b>420</b>, <b>430</b>) to form unwanted larger droplets. The porous material may be tailored by oxidization at a high temperature in the range from about 300° C. to about 1000° C. for a duration of about 1 hour to about 20 days, or by coating a thin layer of another material such as alumina by SOL coating or nickel using chemical vapor deposition over the surface and the inside of pores to block the smaller pores, decrease pore size of larger pores, and in turn increase the inter-pore distance. As such, the merger of droplets may be reduced or eliminated and the formation of smaller droplets may be permitted. An SEM image of a tailored substrate or apertured section is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">The making of substrates for use as apertured sections (<b>140</b>, <b>140</b> <i>a</i>, <b>240</b>, <b>415</b>, <b>425</b>, <b>435</b>, <b>445</b>, <b>511</b>, <b>521</b>, <b>531</b>, <b>541</b>) with sufficiently small micro-scale apertures or pores (<b>144</b>, <b>144</b> <i>a</i>, <b>244</b>, <b>416</b>, <b>426</b>, <b>436</b>, <b>446</b>, <b>513</b>, <b>523</b>, <b>533</b>, <b>543</b>) to provide emulsions having droplet sizes smaller than about one micron can be problematic. One of the reasons for this lies in the fact that relatively high surface roughness occurs with untreated regular porous materials such as a metallic porous substrates made from powder/particles by compression and/or sintering. These metallic porous substrates typically do not have the required pore size in the surface region when a given nominal pore size is lower than a certain value. While the bulk of the porous material may have the specified nominal pore size, the surface region is often characterized by merged pores and cavities of much larger sizes. This problem can be overcome by tailoring these substrates to provide for the desired pore size and inter-pore distance in the surface region. This may be done by removing a surface layer from the porous substrate and adding a smooth new surface with smaller openings. The droplet size in the emulsion that may be formed using these tailored substrates may be reduced without increasing the pressure drop across the substrate. Since direct grinding or machining of the porous surface may cause smearing of the surface structure and blockage of the pores, the porous structure may be filled with a liquid filler, followed by solidification and mechanical grinding/polishing. The filler is then removed to regain the porous structure of the material. The filler may be a metal with a low melting point such as zinc or tin or the precursor of a polymer such as an epoxy. The liquid filling and removing steps may be assisted by the use of a vacuum. Grinding/polishing may be effected using a grinding machine and a grinding powder. Metal filler removal may be effected by melting and vacuum suction, or by acid etching. Epoxies or other polymers may be removed by solvent dissolution or by burn-off in air.</p>

The relatively thin sheet <b>146</b> may be bonded to the relatively thick sheet <b>150</b> using any suitable procedure (e.g., diffusion bonding) to provide a composite construction <b>154</b> with enhanced mechanical strength. The relatively thin sheet <b>146</b> may have a thickness in the range from about 0.001 to about 0.5 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 0.2 mm. The relatively small apertures <b>148</b> may have any shape, for example, circular, triangular or rectangular. The relatively small apertures <b>148</b> may have an average diameter in the range from about 0.05 to about 50 microns, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 20 microns. The relatively thick sheet or plate <b>150</b> may have a thickness in the range from about 0.1 to about 5 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 2 mm.

The apertures <b>148</b> and <b>152</b> may be coaxially aligned or connected in such a manner that liquid flowing through the apertured sections flows initially through apertures <b>152</b> then through apertures <b>148</b>. The relatively short passageway for the liquid to flow through the relatively small apertures <b>148</b> enables the liquid to flow through the apertures <b>148</b> with a relatively low pressure drop as compared to the pressure drop that would occur if the passageway in the apertures had a length equal to the combined length of apertures <b>146</b> and <b>152</b>.</p>

The number of layers may be two, three, or more. An advantage of these multilayered substrates is that they provide enhanced durability and adhesion. Examples include sintered ceramics that have relatively large pores on one side and relatively small pores on the other side. The relatively small pores may have diameters in the range of about 2 to about 10 nm. The relatively small pores may be positioned in a relatively thin layer of the multilayered substrate. The relatively thin layer may have a thickness in the range of about 1 to about 10 microns. The side with the relatively small pores may be placed facing the continuous phase flow (i.e., the interior of the process microchannel) to take advantage of relatively high shear forces to remove the relatively small emulsion droplets as they are formed.</p>

    <p num="p-0106">“Relative span” is often referred to as “span.” It is a dimensionless parameter calculated from volume distribution. As with volume median droplet size (VMD), D[v,0.1] and D[v,0.9] are diameters representing the points at which 10% and 90%, respectively, of the volume of liquid dispersed is in droplets of smaller diameter. The span may be defined as D[v,0.9] minus D[v,0.1] which is then divided by the VMD (D[v,0.5]). The span for the droplets in emulsions made by the inventive process may be in the range from about 0.005 to about 10, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 10, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 5, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 2, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 1, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 0.5, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 0.2, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 0.1. In one embodiment, the inventive process may be conducted in a single process microchannel and the span may be in the range of from about 0.01 to about 0.5. In one embodiment, the inventive process may be conducted in a scaled-up emulsification process employing multiple process microchannels and the span may be in the range from about 0.01 to about 1.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">In one embodiment, the volume-based diameter for the droplets in the emulsions made by the inventive process may be in the range from about 0.01 to about 200 microns, and the span may be in the range from about 0.005 to about 10.

    <p num="p-0108">As indicated above, the emulsion formed with the inventive process may be a double emulsion, that is, a w/o/w or o/w/o emulsion. These may be characterized by droplets of a third liquid encapsulated within droplets of a second liquid. The encapsulated droplets are dispersed in a continuous phase. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, double emulsion <b>10</b> contains droplets <b>12</b> of a third liquid which are encapsulated within droplets <b>14</b> of a second liquid. The encapsulated droplets are dispersed in continuous phase <b>16</b> of a first liquid. The first liquid may or may not have the same composition as the third liquid. The droplets <b>12</b> may have a volume-based mean diameter of about 0.001 to about 10 microns, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 5 microns. The droplets <b>14</b> may have a volume-based mean diameter of about 0.001 to about 10 microns, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 5 microns. Any of the three phases in these double emulsions may contain particulate solids as discussed above. Double emulsions are used in various applications, such as in the drug, medical, food and cosmetic industries. An advantageous feature that can be provided by these double emulsions is to provide for a controlled disposal time and rate where an active ingredient in the third liquid is consumed in a later time, typically after or during the use or transport of the second liquid. Another feature is that an active ingredient in the third liquid can be separated from the first liquid and thus maintained unchanged during delivery before use when the active ingredient in the third liquid is chemically or physically incompatible with the first liquid or when the first liquid can only be used as a carrier liquid.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">In one embodiment, the emulsion produced by the inventive process may be terminally filtered or filtered in-line. The use of such filtering is particularly suitable for producing emulsions such as pharmaceutical compositions where sterilization issues are significant. With such filtering relatively large particles of contaminants (e.g., biological materials) may be removed. In one embodiment, the inventive process includes providing for the filtering of the product emulsion in-line in a continuous closed (i.e., antiseptic) process.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">An advantage of the inventive process, at least in one embodiment, is that the gap distances between the process microchannels, liquid channels and heat exchange channels may be the same whether the process is intended for laboratory or pilot plant scale or for full production scale. As a result, the particle size distribution of the emulsions produced by the microchannel mixers used with the inventive process may be substantially the same whether the microchannel mixer is built on a laboratory or pilot plant scale or as a full scale plant unit. This is shown by the particle size distribution curve presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The difference in the distribution curves provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> for the single process channel and for the scale up system may result from an unwanted corner effect contribution. However, by making the edges opaque the unwanted effect of non-uniform shear force on droplet size can be minimized and thus the particle size distribution curve for the single process microchannel may be the same or substantially the same as that for the scale-up system.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">Shear force on a liquid control element (in discretized form) in the direction of velocity u may be calculated by the formula F<sub>x</sub>=mu*du/dy, where mu is viscosity, and du/dy is the velocity gradient for the liquid flow normal to the apertured section. However, as in a location of liquid (represented by a control element) the velocity generally has three components, and shear force also has three components. For a channel flow near and at the surface, a one dimensional assumption can be made and F<sub>x </sub>can approximate the net shear at an element surface of the liquid. The use of computational fluid dynamics, including commercial software packages such as Fluent or FEMLAB, may be used to solve the required transport equations such that the surface shear force may be calculated. The surface shear force may be calculated along the channel length, parallel to the direction of flow. Shear force may also be calculated between parallel channels, where flow distribution effects are included to determine the mass flux into each parallel channel as a function of the detailed channel and manifold geometry. Additional calculation methods can be found, for example, in “Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics,” 3<sup>rd </sup>Ed., B. R. Munson, D. F. Young and T. H. Okiishi, John Wiley &amp; Son, Inc., Weinheim, 1998.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">In one embodiment, the shear force deviation factor (SFDF) for a process employing a single process microchannel may be within about 50% of the SFDF for a scaled-up process involving multiple process microchannels. SFDF may be calculated using the formula
<br> <i>SFDF</i>=(<i>F</i> <sub>max</sub> <i>−F</i> <sub>min</sub>)/(2<i>F</i> <sub>mean</sub>)<br>
wherein: F<sub>max </sub>is the maximum shear force in a process microchannel for a specific liquid; F<sub>min </sub>is the minimum shear force in the process microchannel for the liquid; and F<sub>mean </sub>is the arithmetic average shear force for the liquid at the surface of the apertured section (<b>140</b>, <b>140</b> <i>a</i>, <b>240</b>, <b>415</b>, <b>425</b>, <b>435</b>, <b>445</b>, <b>511</b>, <b>521</b>, <b>531</b>, <b>541</b>) within the process microchannel. Within a single process microchannel, operated in accordance with the inventive process, the SFDF may be less than about 2, and in one embodiment less than about 1, and in one embodiment less than about 0.5, and in one embodiment less than about 0.2.
</p>
    <p num="p-0113">In one embodiment, the inventive process may provide for a relatively uniform shear force while employing multiple process microchannels. To measure the shear force uniformity among multiple process microchannels, the average shear force is calculated for each channel and compared. F<sub>max </sub>is the largest value of the average channel shear force, and F<sub>min </sub>is the smallest value of the average shear force. F<sub>mean </sub>is the mean of the average shear forces of all the channels. SFDF may be calculated from these values. Among multiple process microchannels, at least with one embodiment of the inventive process, the SFDF may be less than about 2, and in one embodiment less than about 1, and in one embodiment less than about 0.5, and in one embodiment less than about 0.2.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">A comparison of an emulsion made using the inventive process having a narrow distribution of droplet sizes to an emulsion made using a conventional batch emulsification process may be provided with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a microscopic image of an emulsion made by the inventive process while <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows an emulsion made by a conventional process. The droplets in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> have a wide size distribution and larger droplet sizes. The droplets in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> have a relatively narrow size distribution and smaller droplet sizes. The benefits of narrow droplet size distribution include, for example, uniform spread of active ingredients on an applied surface such as skin, and exclusions of unwanted small droplet penetration into small scale surface structures that may occur using an emulsion having a wide distribution. Another advantage relates to reducing the use of surfactants, as excess surfactant is often used to maintain a stable emulsion due to the presence of the smallest droplets if the emulsion droplet size distribution has a wide range, for example, from about 2 to about 20 microns. A narrow droplet size distribution enables a more accurate determination of the amount of surfactant that is just required, and in turn reduces or eliminates the use of unnecessary surfactant. In one embodiment of the present invention, when the droplet size distribution is sufficiently narrow, for example a span of less than about 0.5, the amount of surfactant that may be used can be reduced significantly since the emulsion does not contain unwanted small droplets that may require a higher surfactant concentration in the whole emulsion after production has been completed.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">The heat exchange fluid may be any fluid. These include air, steam, liquid water, gaseous nitrogen, liquid nitrogen, other gases including inert gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, molten salt, oils such as mineral oil, gaseous hydrocarbons, liquid hydrocarbons, and heat exchange fluids such as Dowtherm A and Therminol which are available from Dow-Union Carbide.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">The heat exchange fluid may comprise the first, second or third liquid used in making the emulsions. This can provide process pre-heat or pre-cooling and increase overall thermal efficiency of the process.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">In one embodiment, the heatexchange channels comprise process channels wherein an endothermic or exothermic process is conducted. These heat exchange process channels may be microchannels. Examples of endothermic processes that may be conducted in the heat exchange channels include steam reforming and dehydrogenation reactions. In one embodiment, the incorporation of a simultaneous endothermic reaction to provide an improved heat sink may enable a typical heat flux of roughly an order of magnitude or more above the convective cooling heat flux. Examples of exothermic processes that may be conducted in the heat exchange channels include water-gas shift reactions, methanol synthesis reactions and ammonia synthesis reactions. The use of simultaneous exothermic and endothermic reactions to exchange heat in a microchannel reactor is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/222,196, filed Aug. 15, 2002.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">In one embodiment, the heat exchange fluid undergoes a phase change as it flows through the heat exchange channels. This phase change provides additional heat addition or removal from the process microchannels or liquid channels beyond that provided by convective heating or cooling. For a liquid heat exchange fluid being vaporized, the additional heat being transferred from the process microchannels would result from the latent heat of vaporization required by the heat exchange fluid. An example of such a phase change would be an oil or water that undergoes nucleate boiling. In one embodiment, the vapor mass fraction quality of the boiling of the phase change fluid may be up to about 50%.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">The use of enhanced heat transfer from phase change or a chemical reaction may be more advantageous when emulsion generation occurs in coordination with a chemical reaction in the process channels. In one embodiment, the emulsion may be, for example, a reactive monomer for a polymerization reaction or other and as such require additional heat exchange.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">The heat flux for convective heat exchange or convective cooling in the microchannel mixer may be in the range from about 0.01 to about 125 watts per square centimeter of surface area of the process microchannels (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) in the microchannel mixer, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 50 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and in one embodiment about 1 to about 25 cm<sup>2</sup>, and in one embodiment from about 1 to about 10 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The heat flux for phase change heat exchange may be in the range from about 1 to about 250 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and in one embodiment, from about 1 to about 100 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and in one embodiment from about 1 to about 50 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and in one embodiment from about 1 to about 25 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and in one embodiment from about 1 to about 10 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">The heat exchange channels may be used to provide sterile conditions during formation of the emulsions using the inventive process. Unlike batch mixers, the inventive process may be closed to the environment and does not need an inert gas blanket for isolation from the environment. The heat exchange channels, which may be adjacent to the process microchannels or liquid channels may provide relatively short heat transport and diffusion distances which permits rapid heating and cooling of the liquids in the microchannel mixer with decreased temperature gradients. As a result, emulsions that are not suitable for prolonged heating or would degrade under large temperature gradients may be prepared using the inventive process. In one embodiment, the temperature gradients between the process microchannel walls and the bulk flow within the process microchannels at the same axial position in the process microchannels may be less than about 5° C., and in one embodiment less than about 2° C., and in one embodiment less than about 1° C.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">Heat exchange channels in close proximity to the process microchannels and/or liquid channels with controlled heating and/or cooling may provide for uniform temperature profiles between multiple process microchannels. This enables uniform heating and cooling at more rapid rates than can be obtained with conventional processing equipment such as mixing tanks. In a multichannel microchannel mixer, at least some axial position along the process flow length the temperature difference between the process microchannels may be less than about 5° C., and in one embodiment less than about 2° C., and in one embodiment less than about 1° C.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">The heat exchange channels adjacent to either the process microchannels, liquid channels or both, may employ temperature zones along the length of such channels. In one embodiment, the temperature in a first zone near the entrance to the process channel is maintained at a temperature above a second temperature in a second zone near the end of the process microchannel. A cool down or quench zone may be incorporated into the process microchannel to quickly cool and stabilize the emulsion. Numerous combinations of thermal profiles are possible, allowing for a tailored thermal profile along the length of the process microchannel including the possibility of sections both before and/or after the mixing zone in the process microchannel to heat and/or cool the feed and or emulsion products.</p>

A low flow rate or low pressure drop may lead to a smaller droplet size with the inventive process, as lower inertia of the dispersion phase flow through the aperture reduces droplet growth before droplet breakup.

In one embodiment, the first liquid may be preheated in the non-apertured region (<b>111</b>, <b>111</b> <i>a</i>, <b>411</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>524</b>, <b>534</b>, <b>544</b>) of the process microchannels (<b>110</b>, <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>410</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>) upstream of the mixing zone (<b>113</b>, <b>113</b> <i>a</i>, <b>413</b>, <b>515</b>, <b>525</b>, <b>535</b>, <b>545</b>). The emulsion produced in the microchannel mixer may be cooled in the microchannel mixer or upon exiting the microchannel mixer using any type of heat exchange device, including a microchannel heat exchanger. In one embodiment, the emulsion may be quenched to stabilize the emulsion or lock it in. In one embodiment, the emulsion may be quenched in the non-apertured region (<b>117</b>, <b>117</b> <i>a</i>, <b>516</b>, <b>526</b>, <b>536</b>, <b>546</b>) of the process microchannel (<b>110</b>, <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>). In one embodiment, the emulsion may be cooled to room temperature or quenched in a period in the range of up to about 10 minutes, and in one embodiment up to about 5 minutes, and in one embodiment up to about 1 minute, and in one embodiment up to about 30 seconds, and in one embodiment up to about 10 seconds, and in one embodiment in less than about 1 second.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">The inventive process may be used to make an emulsion at a rate of at least about 0.01 liter per minute, and in one embodiment at least about 1 liter per minute. In one embodiment, the process may be used to make an emulsion at a rate of at least about 1 liter per second.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">In one embodiment, multiple disperse phase liquid reservoirs or chambers may be built around the continuous phase channels, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The individual reservoirs or chambers may be separated and have their own inlet control mechanism such as valves. In this configuration the volumetric ratio of the two phases (packing density) may be controlled and changed according to different formulations of the desired product emulsions without changing other components such as aperture or pore size of the apertured section or individual flow rates of the continuous phase or the disperse phase. This is useful for an “one pass process” (i.e., without recirculation). For example, if all reservoirs or chambers A, B, C and D have the same oil flow rates and pore size, the emulsion packing density by closing valves A and B will be 50% of that by opening all valves. It is noted that various modifications of this concept are possible, for example more than two oil reservoirs or chambers can be configured on each side of the continuous phase channel. Multiple continuous phase channels may be parallel interleaved (sandwiched) to form an array of process channels. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the disperse phase is identified as an oil phase, however, those skilled in the art will recognize that the dispersed phase may be any liquid that is immiscible with the continuous phase liquid. With this embodiment it is possible to produce emulsions having multi-modal droplet size distributions and/or multi-component dispersed phases. With this embodiment it is possible to provide for two or more second liquids entering the process microchannel through different apertured sections. This arrangement may be used to provide for multiple feed points for sequential additions of ingredients.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">In one embodiment, optical or thermal-optical features may be adjusted in the process microchannel. Examples of techniques for measuring and/or adjusting these optical or thermal-optical features include: in-line LSD (laser scattering diffraction) detection for emulsion quality control and analysis including mean droplet size and span; viscometers for assessing product viscosity and solids loading; optical measurement using photographs for droplet size measurement; holographic imaging including interferometry via adjusting emulsion properties; and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">In one embodiment, a liquid adsorption process, a liquid-gas adsorption process, a liquid separation process, a solidification process, or a gasification process may be conducted in the process microchannel. In one embodiment, an emulsion may be produced in the process microchannels for applications wherein charged particles are tacked.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">In one embodiment, a chemical reaction may be conducted in the process microchannel. Examples of the chemical reactions that may be conducted include polymerization reactions (e.g., methyl methacrylate emulsion polymerization reactions), catalytic polymerization reactions (e.g., ethylene polymerization in aqueous solution with neutral nickel (II) complexes as catalysts), production of copolymers and terpolymers, catalyzed and non-catalyzed reactions of liquid phase oxidations (e.g., the production of adipic acid) or gas-liquid phase reactions and catalyzed and non-catalyzed liquid-liquid reactions (e.g., nitration of benzene or olefin alkylation).</p>
    <p num="p-0134">In one embodiment, a biological process may be conducted in the process microchannel. Examples of such biological processes include bioremediation (cleaning) processes using emulsified detergents.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">In one embodiment, emulsions prepared in accordance with the inventive process provide the advantage of enabling the manufacturer to supply the emulsions in concentrate form, thus enabling the end user to add additional ingredients, such as water or oil, to obtain the final fully formulated product.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">The emulsions made by the inventive process have numerous applications. These include personal skin care products wherein reduced concentrations of emulsifiers or surfactants are desirable (e.g., waterproof sun screen, waterproof hand creams or lotions).</p>
    <p num="p-0137">The emulsions made by the inventive process may be useful as paints or coatings. These include water-resistant latex paints with strong weatherability characteristics. The emulsions may be useful as adhesives, glues, caulks, waterproof sealants, and the like. As a result of the inclusion of an aqueous phase in these compositions, the problem of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in these products can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">The inventive process may be used in various food processing applications, particularly continuous processing operations.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">The inventive process may be used in the production of agricultural chemicals where the use of a dispersed phase with a narrow distribution of droplet sizes is advantageous for spreading the chemicals on leafs, and providing enhanced waterproofing with smaller concentrations of chemicals. In one embodiment, the inventive process may be used in the production of agricultural chemicals such as pesticides wherein it may be desired to employ a droplet size for the dispersed phase that is smaller than the wavelength of visible light.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">The inventive process may be used for the production of emulsified lubricants and fuels. These may include on-board fuel emulsification systems such as those used for diesel engines.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">The inventive process may be used in emulsion polymerization processes. For example, it may be possible to solublize monomers in a surfactant with a catalyst. The inventive process may be used to make rapid setting emulsions containing bitumen. These emulsions may be used as surface dressings for cement or asphalt surfaces such as roads, driveways, and the like. These emulsions may contain from about 60 to about 70% by weight bitumen and may be sprayed onto the surface being treated. Chippings may be spread on top of these surface dressings and rolled to ensure proper embedding and alignment. This provides a water impervious surface seal and also an improved surface texture.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">The emulsions made using the inventive process may be silicone emulsions. These emulsions may be used for treating fibers and other substrates to alter their water repellant properties. The inventive process may be used in a crystallization process, for example, a continuous crystallization process. This process may be used to isolate, purify and/or produce powders of a specified size. An example of such crystals include highly refined sugar. In emulsion crystallization, a melt may be crystallized within droplets of the emulsion so that homogeneous nucleation may occur at a lower rate than in a bulk melt. This process may be conducted without solvents, and thus may provide the advantage of low capital and operating costs. The inventive process may be used to make liquid crystals. The liquid crystals formed in the process may help to reduce the use of emulsifiers and/or surfactants, as the dispersed phase may be “locked” in place.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">The inventive process may be used to make wax emulsions for adhesives, liquid soaps, laundry detergents, coatings for textiles or fabrics, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">The inventive process may be used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals wherein the provision of a dispersed oil phase with a narrow distribution of droplet sizes is advantageous. These may include oral or injectable compositions as well as dermatological creams, lotions and opthalmics. The droplet size and distribution achieved with the inventive process may increase the efficacy of the drug and provide for reduced levels of use of the drug for required treatments. This also provides the advantage of avoiding or limiting the use of non-aqueous solvent components which tend to solubilize organic substances used in packaging materials. The droplet size for the dispersed oil phase for these applications may be up to about 0.5 micron, in order to avoid being eliminated by the spleen or liver, and in one embodiment in the range from about 0.01 to about 0.2 micron, and in one embodiment 0.01 to about 0.1 micron. The emulsions produced by the inventive process may function as emulsion vehicles for insoluble or poorly soluble drugs (e.g., ibuprofen, diazepam, griseofulvin, cyclosporin, cortisone, proleukin, etoposide, paclitaxel, cytotoxin, vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, and the like). Many of the pharmaceutical compounds or drugs, oils and surfactants disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0027858A1 may be used in making pharmaceutical compositions using the inventive process; this patent publication is incorporated herein by reference for its disclosure of such compounds or drugs, oils and surfactants. An advantage of using the inventive process relates to the fact that many of the problems associated with using conventional high-shear mixing equipment for attempting to achieve small droplets with a narrow droplet size distribution while maintaining a sterile environment are avoided.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading> <p num="p-0145">The microchannel device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is made from stainless steel and used to form an oil-in-water emulsion. The device includes a base part for continuous phase flow, a top part for delivering a discontinuous oil phase, a porous substrate, a header, a footer, and tubing and piping to provide for the flow of liquids to the microchannel device.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">The base part, which has an overall size of ⅗×1.5×1.5 inches, has an open microchannel having the dimensions of 0.02×0.5×0.5 inch, and sloping inlet and outlet flow passageways (0.5 inch long, 0.5 inch wide, slopping angle 27°) that are connected via welding with the header and footer for the continuous phase liquid. The edge of the open microchannel has a lip (step) with a width of 0.02 inch for mounting the porous substrate via rubber gasket of thickness 0.005 inch for sealing. With the mounting of the porous substrate (0.5×0.5×0.04 inch), a microchannel is formed for providing high velocity flow of a continuous phase and generating micro-scale droplets as a dispersed phase in the continuous phase.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">The top part comprises a built-in oil chamber (see right-side figure in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) connected to an oil pipe line (not shown in the drawing). The header and footer (the parts with slope and connected spaces) are designed for flow area transition from ordinary tubes to the microchannel with a small gap (less than 1 mm), while the overall pressure drop is maintained at a reasonable value depending upon the pump and heating capacity.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">A schematic of the basic structure is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. The porous substrate is a heat treated porous substrate supplied by MOTT Metallurgical Corp. of Farmington, Conn. The porous substrate is made from stainless steel <b>316</b>. The average diameter of each pore is 0.5 micron. The porous substrate separates the disperse phase liquid chamber from the continuous phase liquid channel. A pressure difference (10 to 20 psia) during the emulsification operation drives the disperse phase liquid through the porous substrate into the continuous liquid channel which results in the formation of droplets in the continuous phase.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">The emulsification system is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. This system includes an oil pump (FMI “Q” pump, Model QG6 from FluidMetering, Inc, Syosset, N.Y.), a water pump with a flow rate dial (Micropump Model GJ-N25, JF18A from Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, Ill.), a heated oil reservoir, a continuous phase liquid reservoir, and metallic tubings (¼″) connecting the pumps and the microchannel emulsifier. An extra rotor flow meter (Cole Parmer) is installed to record the actual flow rate and for later calibration. By installing heating tapes around most of the metallic tubing, exposed components as well as the microchannel device and by feed-back controlling the heating power via TC signals from multiple key locations, all components and the liquids in the system are maintained at a temperature that is higher than the ambient. The components to be heated up and controlled include the microchannel emulsifier, oil pump and reservoir, and water reservoir. The reservoirs have inside volume scales.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">Before being used for emulsification, the porous substrate is cleaned and heat-treated. The following cleaning procedure is used.
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0150">1. Sonicate in hexane for 5 min. If the porous substrate is pre-exposed to oil, repeat hexane sonication once with fresh hexane.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0151">2. Air dry at room temperature over night, or at 80° C. for 10-20 minutes in a drying oven.</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0152">3. Sonicate the porous substrate in 20% nitric acid for 20 minutes.</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0153">4. Sonicate the porous substrate in fresh deionized water for 5 minutes.</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0154">5. Repeat step #4 at least three times to achieve pH reading of the water of over 5.</li> <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0155">6. Sonicate the porous substrate in acetone or isopropanol for 3 minutes.</li> <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0156">7. Air dry at room temperature overnight, or at 80° C. for 10-20 minutes in a drying oven.
<br>
The porous substrate is then heat treated in a heat treatment vessel using the following procedure:
</li> <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0157">1. Evacuate and refill with nitrogen three times.</li> <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0158">2. Heat in the presence of hydrogen and water to 650° C. at a rate of 3.5° C. per minute.</li> <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0159">3. Maintain temperature at 650° C. for 30 minutes with nitrogen flow.</li> <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0160">4. Maintain temperature at 650° C. in air for 100 hours.</li> <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0161">5. Cool in air to room temperature at a rate of 3.5° C. per minute.
<br>
One of the methods to characterize the heat treatment effect on the pore size and number is to conduct permeability tests using water. Using the same flow rate, water is pumped through the heat-treated porous substrate and through an untreated porous substrate. Different pressure drop curves are obtained as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The heat-treated substrate has a higher pressure drop than that of untreated substrate. In this example, the average pore size decreases from 0.5 to 0.44 micron while the inter-pore distance increases from 0.5 to 0.6 micron.
