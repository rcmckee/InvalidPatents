<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0003">This invention pertains generally to gaming systems. More particularly, the invention is a apparatus and method configured to maintain a player's game state.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">2. The Prior Art</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Gaming devices of various types have been in use for many years. The most common type is the conventional slot. A player operates a slot machine by providing coin or paper monies that are received as game credits towards playing a game on the slot machine. Some machines allow a user to provide game credits in the form of a voucher, a printed coupon or a data card (e.g. magnetic strip or smart card). Once the sufficient amount of game credits has been provided to constitute a wager, the player then initiates the game, normally by pulling a handle or activating a button. If a winning event occurs pursuant to the game, the slot machine issues a winning amount according to the player's wager and to a predetermined pay scheme. The game results are generally based on randomly generated events. The winning amount issued to the user is provided by a corresponding amount of game credits, which the player may redeem (cash-out) or use for further play on the slot machine. Similar game play and award schemes are provided according to other gaming devices such as video poker machines and keno machines.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Bonus and progressive awards have been introduced as improvements to conventional gaming devices to entice increased game play and income for casinos. For example, a common bonus scheme is to award a player a chance to multiply his award winnings pursuant to a secondary or bonus stage of the game. Most bonus awards are simply an increased multiple of the primary winnings and are issued as game credits suitable for redemption or further play of the gaming device. In certain cases where the bonus award is large, manual payout by a casino attendant may be required. In some cases, a non-monetary prize (e.g., a car or motorcycle) is made the subject of the bonus award. Like the monetary progressive awards, these non-monetary prizes are normally tendered manually by a casino attendant.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Progressive awards, like bonus awards, also normally comprise simple monetary credits, but typically comprise a large jackpot amount. Progressive schemes employ a plurality of gaming machines that the players of each compete for the progressive award, wherein a portion of the wager is contributed to the progressive award. Upon the occurrence of a specific game result, the progressive award is issued to the player. Since the progressive award is normally large, it is normally paid manually by a casino attendant or cashier.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Another prior art gaming implementation is known as “investment bonus”. An example of this type of game is the 1937 Mills “Bonus Bell” game which provides a primary slot reel game, and a secondary investment bonus game (or “come-on” feature). During play the word “BONUS” could be spelled out by hitting the correct letters in sequence on the first reel for an eighteen (18) coin award. This type of game is generally referred to as an “investment bonus” game, because the player invests in continued play of the same machine to achieve the requirements for the bonus award (e.g., forming the word “BONUS”). If the player were to terminate play of the investment game prior to completing the requirements for the bonus award (e.g., the player only completes “BON”, the player normally forfeits the player's prior investments (“BON”) and must later fulfill the requirements anew. Furthermore, a subsequent player may “take over” a previous player's investment by commencing play of the investment bonus game after the previous player vacates the machine.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Current gaming devices and methods, while suitable for normal award credit payout and one-time non-monetary prize payout, have some particular disadvantages. First, current gaming schemes are not well suited for awarding prizes having a hierarchical arrangement which require a player to collect two or more “winning events” towards the redemption of an award. This is especially true where the winning events may be derived from two or more gaming machines. For example, in conventional “bonus”, secondary, or investment bonus games, the player may accumulate points towards redemption of a bonus prize. An example of such points may be spaces on a game board such as tic-tac-toe or Monopoly™ or in the case of the Mills game, a collection of letters to form the word “BONUS”. Once the player has accumulated the sufficient number of (e.g., collection of or arrangement of) game points, the player may be awarded a bonus prize. However, current systems do not allow a player to collect the player's game points on one machine for usage on a secondary machine for further collection of points toward prize redemption. Nor do current systems provide the collection of points on one machine for redemption of awards on another machine or a central (or separate) prize station. Current systems also fail to provide for collection of points on one machine for later aggregation with the same machine during subsequent play.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Furthermore, current systems do not provide a hierarchical scheme of non-monetary prizes. As noted above, current bonus or progressive prizes present a single jackpot, perhaps at various prize levels. However, current systems fail to provide for accumulation of lower prize awards for subsequent opportunities at achieving higher level award prizes based on the accumulation of lower prize awards. A system which would offer game play and accumulation of points towards redemption of prizes either on a second gaming machine or a central or separate prize station would entice continued game play and therefore additional revenue for the casino.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">According to some jurisdictions, gaming is restricted to lottery-based play, where a game results is selected from a fixed pool of outcomes, rather than from a randomly generated event. These systems also provide for similar bonus or progressive structures as described above utilizing fixed-pool schemes. The needs outlined above for an award and redemption system having movable game points or credits are also needed in lottery-based gaming environments to encourage increased game play and thereby increase revenue.</p>
  <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0012">To overcome these and other shortcomings of the prior art, disclosed herein is a gaming apparatus and method suitable for use with games of chance including live table games, as well as lottery-based games, which allows a user to collect and redeem “award credits” on one or more machines for redemption of prizes at another machine or a centralized or separate award station. The present invention is likely suitable for use with games involving skill, such as arcade video games and home electronic and computer video games.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">The system of the present invention generally comprises one or more gaming devices (e.g., slot machine, video lottery terminal, keno machine, live table game, bingo game) and a prize station having one or more prizes. During play of the gaming device, a particular game result may provide a winning event at which the gaming device issues an “award credit” to the player of the gaming device. The winning event may be based on the primary game (e.g., indicia combination on a primary slot game) or based on a secondary game (e.g., indicia indicated by a secondary wheel game) as well as other non-primary games. Under this arrangement, the game play for the “award credits” can be made independent of the underlying primary or secondary game, if so desired.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">Unlike traditional loyalty programs which award “prizes” based on the number of plays (e.g., free lunch buffer after 100 slot plays) or the amount of credits won (e.g., free hotel stay after player wins 100 game credits), the present invention provides “award credits” based on a game event (e.g., game results on the primary or secondary other non-primary game).</p>
  <p num="p-0015">The player may accumulate additional “award credits” during continued play of the gaming device. The award credits, unlike game credits, are generally not redeemable for further play on the game device, but rather may be redeemed for the prizes (e.g. goods, services, or monetary awards) at the prize station once the appropriate accumulation has been established.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">The system is further configured to allow the player to collect the award credits from one gaming device for usage on other gaming devices or for redemption of prizes at the prize station. In this way, the award credits are generally associated with a particular player via a prize bearing instrument (PBI) which is described herein. The award credits may also be accumulated without a PBI, where the award credits are maintained on a memory (such as that used with conventional credit meters) either locally on the gaming device or via a server in communication with the gaming device.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">According to one embodiment to of the invention, the PBI is a voucher (printed ticket) printed by the gaming device via a printer. The voucher may then be presented to a voucher reader on the same or a second gaming device that ascertains the number of credits associated with the player. The player may accumulate further award credits during continued play of the same or second gaming device, the additional award credits accumulated with previous award credits. The award credits may be collected and transferred repeatedly. The system contemplates usage of other PBI media such as magnetic or smart cards. The system also contemplates manual entry of voucher information by a player to the gaming device, where the gaming device is not equipped with a voucher reader, for example. The voucher information entered by the player may then be used to access a central server which identifies the player's game state and award credit information.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">As is known in the art, the award credits may be embedded as machine or human readable data in or on the PBI. In this way, the gaming devices need not be coupled for communication with each other or with the prize station to determine the award credits associated with the players; the award credits may be determined directly from the PBI. As is also known in the art, the data on the PBI may be secured using encryption technology.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">According to one of the preferred embodiments of the invention, the gaming devices and the prize station of the present system are operatively coupled for communication with each other, normally via a network or data connection. In this way, transactions and award credits may be verified by a “back-end” validation device. In this environment, award credits may be maintained on a database associated with validation device rather than on the PBI. The PBI may simply contain identifying information to associate a player with the player's award credits, which is contained on the database, thereby providing increased security of the award credits. Another benefit of a networked environment is that the prizes may be remotely monitored by a central inventory device via tracking (e.g., RFID) tags associated with the prizes. Copending application by the applicant entitled “Apparatus and Method for Dispensing of Awards” having attorney docket number 732.179 discloses a method of tracking prizes via an inventory device, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">According to another aspect of the invention, promotional award credits may be issued to promote the player to play the game devices of the invention. The promotional award credits may be issued to the player according to non-gaming activities, such as via a mailing promotion and a PBI. The promotional award credits may be combined with other award credits issued by gaming devices for collection and redemption for prizes.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">Once the player has accumulated the requisite (e.g., collection and/or quantity of) award credits for prize redemption, the player may redeem the award credits via the prize station. In general, the player presents the PBI to the prize station that determines the award credits associated with the player and determines the prizes to which the player is entitled. According to one embodiment of the invention, prizes are assigned a particular number of award credits for redemption. According to another embodiment, prizes are assigned according to a collection (or types) of award credits. The prize station offers a prize selection to the player according to the player's award credits.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">In general, the prizes are maintained in a protectable area visible to the users. For example, the prizes may be maintained in one or more vaults, each having a door equipped with a window, each door secured by a latch. Upon selection of a prize, the latch is released to allow the user to retrieve the selected prize. The present invention contemplates various dispensing means for awarding the prize to the player including the use of additional security and verification. For example, the prize station may first verify that the prize to be awarded is present in the requested vault by first checking the RFID. The prize station may also provide verification of the player's award credits prior to dispensing the award. The prize station may also require a casino attendant to provide a security key (e.g., a card key and/or physical key) prior to dispensing the award.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">According to another embodiment of the invention, the prize station comprises a computer device where the prizes are displayed via a monitor device. The user may select a displayed prize, which may be tendered to the player via a kiosk prize station, via an attendant (manually) or via a courier service. In this way, the prize station may be provided via a web-based system, suitable for access via any conventional data processing device (computer) and suitable for connection to the web-based system.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">Various arrangements of the gaming device and the prize station are further contemplated by the present invention. For example, the gaming device and the prize station may be integrated into a single unit or the prize station may be integrated into a second gaming device. The prize station may be alternatively managed by a casino attendant using a prize booth, where the attendant verifies the player's award credits and manually tenders the selected prize.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a prize award may be dependent upon the player earning an “award credit” each of a predetermined number of game types or game machines. For example, the player may need to win “car award credit” from each often (10) machines (e.g. slot machine, poker machine, keno machine, etc.) to win a car prize. This arrangement encourages game play on each of the machines where the player may win the requisite “award credits”. In another example, the player may be required to win “award credits” from different “groups” or banks of gaming machines, perhaps located in different casino sites.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">The invention further relates to machine readable media on which are stored embodiments of the present invention. It is contemplated that any media suitable for retrieving instructions is within the scope of the present invention. By way of example, such media may take the form of magnetic, optical, or semiconductor media. The invention also relates to data structures that contain embodiments of the present invention, and to the transmission of data structures containing embodiments of the present invention. Further objects and advantages of the invention will be brought out in the following portions of the specification, wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing the preferred embodiment of the invention without placing limitations thereon.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0040">Persons of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the following description of the present invention is illustrative only and not in any way limiting. Other embodiments of the invention will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">Referring more specifically to the drawings, for illustrative purposes the present invention is embodied in the apparatus shown in FIG. <b>1</b> through FIG. <b>9</b>. It will be appreciated that the apparatus may vary as to configuration and as to details of the parts, and that the method may vary as to details and the order of the acts, without departing from the basic concepts as disclosed herein. The invention is disclosed generally in terms of a system maintaining player's award credits in a gaming environment, although numerous other uses for the invention will suggest themselves to persons of ordinary skill in the art, including usage in arcade and home entertainment environments, for example.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Referring first to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram of an example system <b>10</b> for maintaining a player's state is generally shown. System <b>10</b> includes a gaming device <b>12</b> and a prize station <b>14</b>. Gaming device <b>12</b> comprises a conventional game of chance, such as a slot machine, video poker machine, video lottery device, keno machine, bingo machine. The gaming device <b>12</b> may alternatively comprise a live table game of chance, such as a blackjack table or roulette table, where the functions described herein carried out by the gaming device are carried out by a table attendant.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">With respect to gaming device <b>12</b>, provided therein is a game <b>16</b> configured for play by a player. Accordingly, gaming device <b>12</b> includes typical hardware and software components (not shown), such as a processor, memory, and input/output devices such as a video output and control inputs, and game software, for executing game <b>16</b>. According to play of the game <b>16</b>, one or more game results may provide the player with an “award credit”. As noted above, the game results may be provided by a game of chance involving random events or may be provided from a predetermined outcome selected from a fixed pool (e.g., a lottery).</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Award credits, unlike game credits which are used for playing the game <b>14</b>, are suitable for redemption of prizes or awards on the prize station <b>14</b>. For example, the award credits may comprise game pieces which may be collected by the player for redemption at the prize station <b>14</b>. In this example, the game pieces may be part of a game board or puzzle and when the player has collected a particular subset (i.e., collection or accumulation) of game pieces, the player may be entitled to an award or prize from the prize station <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>a </i>illustrates a sample game board <b>40</b> <i>a </i>having spaces for game pieces <b>42</b> <i>a </i>through <b>42</b> <i>n</i>. The game pieces <b>42</b> <i>a </i>through <b>42</b> <i>n </i>may be represented by indicia or representation to a particular theme, such as a popular board game, television show, movie, etc. Certain games rules may require accumulation of all or part of the game pieces <b>4</b> <i>a </i>through <b>42</b> <i>n </i>for prize awards.</p>
  <p num="p-0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>b </i>illustrations a second sample game board <b>40</b> <i>b </i>having letter space holders to accommodate letters <b>43</b> <i>a </i>through <b>43</b> <i>e </i>corresponding to the word “BONUS”. This game, similar to the Mills game described above, allows a player to collect letters (game pieces) from the word “BONUS” during game play of the primary game, normally a slot game. Once the player has collected all the letters, the player may redeem a “Bonus” prize from the prize station. Other game board formats and rules are also suitable for use with the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">According to one aspect of the invention, the gaming device <b>12</b> is configured to maintain a record of the accumulated award credits (game pieces) associated with the player, including award credits earned during play of the game <b>16</b>. The player may maintain the player's state of award credits earnings (e.g., game state) even when the player has terminated play of the gaming device <b>12</b>. In the present embodiment, the player's game state is maintained via a prize bearing instrument (PBI) <b>22</b>. The PBI <b>22</b> may comprise any media suitable for associating a player's award credits with the player. Example media include a printed ticket (voucher), a magnetic or smart card, or other information storage medium. As an interface to the PBI <b>22</b>, the gaming device <b>12</b> provides a PBI reader/writer device (not shown) capable of reading a PBI <b>22</b> and writing to (or generating) a PBI <b>22</b>. The PBI <b>22</b> will typically contain one or more data records indicating the number of (or collection of) award credits earned by the player. For vouchers, the gaming device <b>12</b> will include a voucher reader and a voucher printer in operable communication with the game device <b>12</b>. When the player selects to terminate play, the gaming device <b>12</b> prints a voucher indicating the number of award credits earned by the player.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">The gaming device <b>12</b> is also configured to determine the accumulated award credits previously earned by the player, generally by reading the PBI <b>22</b> as presented by the player and identifying the award credits. The previous award credits may have been earned from the same gaming device <b>12</b> or a similar gaming device having the features of gaming device <b>12</b>. Promotional award credits may also be issued according to non-gaming activities (such as a promotional mailer) and is generally indicated as PBI distribution <b>20</b> in FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The award credits previously earned as identified by the gaming device <b>12</b> are accumulated with further award credits which the player may earn during current play of the gaming device <b>12</b>. Again, the accumulated award credits may be maintained by the player at the termination of play of the gaming device <b>12</b> via another PBI <b>22</b> which indicates the accumulated award credits thus earned. The PBI <b>22</b> thus preserves the “game state” of the player upon termination of play on the gaming device. The player may later resume play of the gaming device <b>12</b> at the preserved game state by later presenting the PBI <b>22</b>, as described above. In the example “BONUS” game of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>b</i>, the player retains the player's earned letters (investment) so that when the player later continues play either on the same or different game, the player's letters (investment) is retained and restored and the player resumes play from the preserved game state. Although described herein for the purposes of redeeming tangible prizes and service, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention is suitable for use with preserving game states (e.g., award credits, game pieces) for use with bonus games, progressive games, investment bonus games, among others.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the prize station <b>14</b> comprises one or more prizes <b>18</b>. The prizes may be tangible goods (e.g., diamonds, keys to a car, event tickets), services, or monetary awards. Although not required for operation of the invention, the prizes are not generally redeemable directly via cash payments by the player to the prize station or the game devices. Rather the prizes are normally redeemable via award credits earned by the player from playing the gaming device <b>12</b> or from other distribution means <b>20</b>. The redemption process <b>26</b> is initiated by a player, generally by presenting one or more PBI <b>22</b> to the prize station <b>14</b>. The prize station <b>14</b> is equipped with a PBI reader/writer device (not shown) for reading the PBI <b>22</b> and determining the award credits associated with the player from data provided by the PBI <b>22</b>. The prize station then determines the prizes to which the player is entitled according to the award credits earned by the player. For example, prizes may be selected according to the number of award credits earned (e.g., using a hierarchical prize level arrangement) or according to the collection of types of award credits earned (e.g., game pieces on a game board or puzzle) or both. Other prize payout arrangements may also be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a sample hierarchical prize level arrangement <b>101</b> suitable for use with the present invention. The sample arrangement <b>101</b> includes prize levels comprising a silver level <b>105</b>, a gold level <b>110</b>, and a platinum level <b>115</b>. One or more prizes may be associated with each level <b>105</b> through <b>115</b>. For example, bracelet prizes may be available at the silver level <b>105</b>, watches may be available at the gold level <b>110</b>, and diamond jewelry may be available at the platinum level. According to this arrangement, the gaming device may provide silver level award <b>105</b> during play. The player may decide to redeem the silver award for one of the bracelet prizes, or the player may elect to accumulate additional silver level awards by playing the same or another gaming device. Since arrangement <b>101</b> is hierarchical, the player may accumulate two silvers awards to redeem either two silver prizes or one gold prize. Similarly, the player may accumulate 4 silver awards (or two gold awards) to redeem one platinum prize, two gold prizes, 4 silver prizes, or one gold and two silver prizes. As described below, a player retains any unused (unredeemed) credits during prize redemption. That is, suppose a player has accumulated 4 silver awards, the player may decide to redeem a gold award (at the cost of two silver awards), in which case the player retains the two remaining (change) silver awards for later use or accumulation.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The prize station <b>14</b> offers the player a selection of prizes. After the player's selection, the selected prize <b>28</b> is awarded to the player. According to one embodiment of the invention, the prizes are maintained in vaults having doors secured by latches and windows to thereby allow the player to see the prizes inside the vaults and yet provided a level of security by limiting access to the prize. A button actuator receives the player's selection. In response, the latch is released allowing the player to open the door and retrieve the prize. In another embodiment of the invention, an attendant provides the prize to the player in response to the player's selection. Various security and verification techniques may also be used in conjunction with the invention when the prize is awarded to the player. For example, the invention may implement prize presence and prize inventory verification via ID tags (e.g., optical, RFID tags) affixed or otherwise associated with the prize and transponder sensors at the prize station. In this way the transponder is able to query the ID tag and obtain such information as the presence and identity of the prize including the prize level of the prize, for example. Other security measures may also be implemented including verification of the PBI via a validation server, which verifies transactions indicated by the PBI against records in a database (not shown). Additionally, if an attendant tenders the prize, the attendant may be required to present a code or electronic key identifying the attendant. This identifying information may then be verified against a validation server to determine whether the attendant has sufficient authority to tender prizes to players.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the prize station <b>14</b> comprises a conventional computer having a display monitor to present the prizes. In this embodiment, a web site may be used to provide an interface to which the player redeems award credits. In yet another embodiment of the invention, prize delivery may be made using a conventional courier services or mail service.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">Prizes maintained by the prize station <b>20</b> may comprise a hierarchical format having various prize levels, as described above. Where the user selects a prize at a prize level lower than that to which the player is entitled, the player may still have remaining “unused” or change credits. In this case, the prize station <b>20</b> may offer the player another prize selection if the player is entitled to yet another prize, or the prize station <b>20</b> may issue the player another PBI <b>22</b> bearing a data record indicating the award credits still earned, but unused by the player. This PBI <b>22</b> may then be presented to the gaming device <b>12</b> for accumulation of further award credits based on the continued play of the gaming device <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown another example embodiment of a system <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for maintaining a player's game state in accordance with the present invention. System <b>10</b> <i>a</i>, like system <b>10</b> described above in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, comprises a gaming device <b>12</b> for playing a game <b>16</b> and a prize station <b>14</b> comprising one or more prizes <b>18</b>. System <b>10</b> <i>a </i>further comprises a validation device <b>30</b> which typically comprises a server computer configured with conventional hardware and software components (not shown). The validation device <b>30</b> is operatively coupled for communication with the game device <b>12</b> and the prize station <b>14</b>, normally via a network communication.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">The validation unit <b>30</b> may function in one of a number of ways as described herein. According to one aspect of the invention, the validation unit <b>30</b> may serve to validate award credits which are earned and collected by the player on the gaming device <b>12</b> and redeemed for prizes at the prize station <b>16</b>. Various validation means known in the art may be used to carry this out, including maintaining transaction records on the validation unit <b>30</b> which corresponds to transaction records identified on the player's PBI <b>22</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">According to another aspect of the invention, the use of the validation unit <b>30</b> eliminates (or reduces) the need for recording the actual award credits onto the PBI <b>22</b>. Rather, the validation unit <b>30</b> may serve to maintain the award credits associated with players in a database (not shown) maintained by the validation unit <b>30</b>. Under this arrangement, the player is identified with a record in the database, which further identifies the award credits earned by the player. The player may use any means for identifying herself the system <b>10</b> <i>a</i>, including using a personal identification number (PIN) or alternatively using a PBI <b>22</b>, which instead of bearing the award credits earned by the player, provides a unique identifying information to identify the player's corresponding game state (e.g., award credits or game pieces) information.</p>
  <p num="p-0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts an example ticket voucher <b>50</b>. Ticket voucher <b>50</b> which is printed by and read by the gaming device <b>12</b> and the prize station <b>14</b> includes a data record in the form of a UPC bar code <b>52</b>. As described above in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this data record may identify the player's award credits or may alternatively identify the player's corresponding record in the validation unit's database.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown another example embodiment of a system <b>10</b> <i>b </i>for maintaining a player's game state in accordance with the present invention. System <b>10</b> <i>b </i>like system <b>10</b>, described above, comprises a gaming device <b>12</b> suitable for playing a game <b>16</b> and a prize station <b>14</b> having one or more prizes <b>18</b>. In system <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, the gaming device <b>12</b> and prize station <b>14</b> are integrated into a single unit.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">The gaming device <b>12</b> and the prize station <b>14</b> may further be operatively coupled for communication to allow prize redemption to be made by the player via the gaming device. In this embodiment, the gaming device may include a monitor or other display device (not shown) for displaying game play as well as prize selection on a single display unit. The game unit may further be coupled to or configured to be coupled to a network for connection to the global information network (Internet). Under this arrangement, a web-based scheme may be use to provide prize selection and to select delivery method directly on the gaming device. In this environment, the player's award credits may be used for shopping online. For example, a prize selection may allow a player to purchase a predetermined amount of goods or services from an online merchant (e.g., shopping spree or gift certificate). As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a PBI <b>22</b> may also be used as described above in FIG. <b>1</b> and FIG. <b>3</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown another example embodiment of a system <b>10</b> <i>c </i>for maintaining a player's game state in accordance with the present invention. System <b>10</b> <i>c </i>includes a first game device <b>10</b> having a game <b>16</b> for play and a second game device <b>10</b> <i>a </i>also having a game <b>16</b> <i>a </i>for play. The second game device <b>10</b> <i>a </i>is integrated with a prize station <b>12</b> as described above in conjunction with FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The award credits earned by a player on game device <b>10</b> may be maintained and later presented and accumulated with additional award credits on game device <b>10</b> <i>a </i>(or game device <b>10</b>), normally via PBI <b>22</b>, although as noted above a validation unit may be used to perform this game state maintenance function on the “back-end”. Likewise, award credits earned by a player on game device <b>10</b> <i>a </i>may be maintained via the PBI <b>22</b> for presentation and accumulation of further award credits on game device <b>10</b> (or game device <b>10</b> <i>a</i>). The PBI <b>22</b> may also be presented to the prize station <b>12</b> for prize redemption as described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown another example game state maintenance system <b>60</b> which comprises a plurality of individual systems <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates that a wide area system may be utilizes with the present invention, which includes both connected and unconnected subsystems. Systems <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> are each operatively coupled for communication to a validation device <b>70</b> and a monitoring device <b>72</b> via a data communications network <b>68</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">System <b>62</b> comprises a plurality of game devices and prize stations each coupled to a conventional remote game controller (RGC) <b>80</b>. The RGC <b>80</b> is coupled to the communication network <b>68</b> for communication with the validation and monitoring units. System <b>62</b> includes game devices <b>12</b> and a prize station <b>14</b> as described above in conjunction with FIG. <b>1</b>. System <b>62</b> further includes integrated game devices and prize stations <b>74</b> as described for device <b>10</b> <i>a </i>in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> above. Award credits earned in any of the gaming devices may be maintained according to the present invention, such as via a PBI <b>22</b>, via the validation unit <b>70</b>, or via a combination of the PBI <b>22</b> and the validation unit <b>70</b> as described above. It would also be within the scope of the present invention, although not required, that award credits earned from system <b>62</b> be maintained for use on the other system <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">System <b>64</b>, like system <b>62</b> comprises a plurality of game devices and prize stations each coupled to an RGC <b>80</b>, which is coupled to the communication network <b>68</b>. The game device of system <b>64</b> include table games (TG) <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> as well as conventional gaming devices <b>12</b> and <b>74</b> and a prize station <b>14</b>. Table games <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> are maintained by an attendant or dealer for the particular table game (e.g., blackjack, roulette). Each table game <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> is also equipped with a PBI reader/writer (not shown) to enable a player of the table game to present her PBI <b>22</b> and establish the player's existing or previously earned award credits. Certain game results (such as consecutive blackjacks) may result in further award credits to be earned by the player during play of the table game. At the completion of play the PBI reader/writer may be activated to write to (or generate) a PBI <b>22</b> after play is completed by the player. As noted above, the award credits may alternatively be managed by the validation unit <b>70</b> in conjunction with the PBI <b>22</b>, or otherwise without the need for a PBI <b>22</b>, where for example, player has a PIN number to identify the player. Table game <b>76</b> differs from table game <b>78</b> in that table game <b>76</b> further has in combination a prize station <b>14</b>, where a player may redeem award credits for prizes.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">System <b>66</b> also comprises a plurality of game devices and prize stations, but unlike system <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> is not coupled to the communication network <b>68</b>. Each game device is thus suitable for operation without the validation unit <b>70</b> and monitoring unit <b>72</b>. Therefore, the management of award credits is generally carried out via PBI <b>22</b> as described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">The validation device <b>70</b> operates in substantially the same manner as validation device <b>30</b> as described above in conjunction with FIG. <b>3</b>. Monitoring device <b>72</b> provides additional functionality to the system <b>60</b> by providing the monitoring of prizes within prize stations and game device/price station units connected therewith (system <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>). Monitoring is carried out using identification tags associated with each prize. For example, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags may be connected or otherwise to associated with each prize. When a prize is selected, a signal is transmitted to the validation device <b>70</b> to indicate the prize has been selected. The validation device <b>70</b> may further provide inventory and statistical data relating to the game usage and prize redemption.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">Referring now to FIG. <b>8</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the gaming device <b>12</b> and the prize station <b>14</b> are shown in additional detail. Gaming device <b>20</b> comprises a game <b>16</b> operatively coupled with an award credit manager <b>90</b> operatively coupled for communication with a PBI device <b>92</b>. The PBI device <b>92</b> is configured to read and or write (or generate) PBI <b>22</b> as described above. For example, if the PBI <b>22</b> comprises a printer ticket (voucher), the PBI device <b>92</b> comprises a voucher reader for reading vouchers and indicia printed thereon, such as “Interleaved 2 of 5” bar codes. The PBI device <b>92</b> would further include a voucher printer for generating vouchers when the player terminates play on the gaming device <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">The award credit manager <b>90</b> carries out the operation of managing a player's award credits during play. If a player presents a PBI <b>22</b> prior to playing, the previously earned award credits are identified either directly from the PBI <b>22</b> and/or from the validation device <b>30</b> which communicates with the gaming device <b>10</b>. During play of the game <b>16</b>, the player may earn additional award credits based on winning game events. Such award credits are accumulated by the award credit manager <b>90</b> in conjunction with the previously earned award credits, if any. Upon termination of play of the gaming device by the player, another PBI <b>22</b> may be issued to the player which contains data associating the cumulative award credits earned by the player.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Prize station <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) comprises a PBI device <b>92</b> operatively coupled to an award credit manager <b>96</b>, a prize selection module <b>97</b> coupled to the award credit manager <b>96</b>, and a plurality of prizes <b>99</b> maintained in a vault <b>98</b>, the vault operatively coupled for communication with the prize selection module <b>97</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">When a player presents one or more PBI <b>22</b> devices to the prize station <b>14</b>, the PBI device <b>92</b> determines the award credits associated with the player, either directly from the PBI <b>22</b> and/or from the validation unit <b>30</b>. The award credit manager <b>96</b>, like award credit manager <b>90</b>, manages a player's award credits but with respect to prize redemption. The prize selection unit <b>97</b> offers to the player one or more prize selections based on the player's award credits. The player may select a prize selection or may cancel prize redemption. If a player selects a prize, the prize is awarded from the vault <b>98</b>. If the prize selection does not exhaust the player's total award credits, another prize selection may be offered to the player, if the remaining credits are sufficient to support a prize selection from the vault <b>98</b>. If the remaining award credits are not sufficient to support a prize selection, the remaining award credits are maintained and associated with the player, normally by dispensing another PBI <b>22</b> to that effect.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">Where an attendant manages a prize booth to carry out the functions of the prize station in accordance with the present invention, the player presents one or more PBI <b>22</b> devices to a PBI device <b>92</b> associated with the prize booth to ascertain the award credits associated with the player. The player's award credits are indicated to the attendant, normally via a conventional video display device (not shown). The attendant then notifies the player of the prizes (and/or prize levels) to which the player is entitled according to the player's earned award credits. This can be carried out manually via a catalog (or a prize display booth) or automatically via the display device. In response, the player makes a prize selection, and the attendant either manually tenders the prize to the player or provides automatic (via vending device) or courier delivery (e.g., mail, parcel service) to the player.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The present invention's system and method for maintaining a player's game state may further be used to implement a “game within a game”. As noted above, the prizes are generally awarded based on award credits earned by a player as a result of playing one or more game devices. According to the present invention, the “game within a game” theory requires the player to earn award credits from a predetermined subset of gaming machines. In this way, the player is encouraged to play those gaming machines that provide the requisite award credits. The player plays the underlying gaming machine, yet the player also plays a “higher level game”, namely the collection of award credits (or game pieces) from the predetermined subset of gaming devices, to wit a “game within a game”. This “game within a game” essentially revolutionizes traditional investment bonus games on single machines, wherein the investment is made and accumulated based on play of the predetermined subset gaming machines rather than a single machine.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">FIG. <b>11</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrate two example “game within a game” systems which may be implemented using the game state maintenance system of the present invention. The system <b>150</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> includes a prize station <b>155</b> and a plurality of gaming devices <b>157</b> <i>a </i>through <b>157</b> <i>n</i>. Under this arrangement a particular prize awarded by the prize station <b>155</b> may require an award credit from each of the gaming devices <b>157</b> <i>a </i>through <b>157</b> <i>n</i>, or perhaps a predetermined subset, such as three award credits, one from any three gaming devices <b>157</b> <i>a </i>through <b>157</b> <i>n</i>. Various other award requirements may also be used. For example, each device <b>157</b> <i>a </i>through <b>158</b> <i>n </i>may of different device types (i.e., slot machine, video poker machine, keno machine, bingo machine, roulette table, blackjack table). In this case, the game system <b>150</b> may require an award credit from a predetermine subset of game types.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">The system <b>180</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> includes a prize station <b>185</b> and plurality of banks of gaming devices, generally designated <b>188</b> <i>a </i>through <b>188</b> <i>c</i>. Each bank may comprise a plurality of gaming devices <b>190</b> <i>a </i>through <b>190</b> <i>c</i>. Under the “game within a game” arrangement, the system <b>180</b> may require an award credit from each “bank” in order to receive a particular prize from the prize station <b>185</b>. Each bank may be configured as the same game (e.g., blackjack), the same device type (e.g., slot machine), the same family of game (e.g., games manufactured by Sierra Design Group™), or other arrangement, such as within the same casino room, floor, or property.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">Accordingly, it will be seen that this invention provides a system and method for maintaining player's game state (award credits or game pieces) in a gaming environment. In particular, the player may restore the game state from previously played games either from the same game device or from another game device. The invention also provides for award redemption of the award credits (or game pieces) earned by a player during game play. Although the description above contains much specificity, the description should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing an illustration of the presently preferred embodiment of the invention. Thus the scope of this invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents.</p>
