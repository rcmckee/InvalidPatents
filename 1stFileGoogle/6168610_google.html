    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for endoluminally deploying a graft across an aneurysm and, more particularly, to a catheterization method and apparatus for forming an endoluminal bifurcated graft, such as may be placed across an aortic aneurysm and any associated common iliac aneurysms.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Aortic aneurysms represent a significant medical problem for the general population. Aneurysms within the aorta presently affect between two and seven percent of the general population and the rate of incidence appears to be increasing. This form of atherosclerotic vascular disease (hardening of the arteries) is characterized by a degeneration in the arterial wall in which the wall weakens and balloons outward by thinning. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a dilatation of the main artery of the body. Until the affected artery is removed or bypassed, a patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (“AAA”) must live with the threat of aortic aneurysm rupture and death. See Brody, J. E., “Aneurysm: A Potential Killer Lurking in the Aorta,” <i>The New York Times, </i>Apr. 13, 1994, at C14.</p>
    <p>One known clinical approach for patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a surgical repair procedure. This is an extensive operation involving transperitoneal or retroperitoneal dissection of the aorta and replacement of the aneurysm with an artificial artery known as a prosthetic graft. This procedure requires a significant abdominal incision extending from the lower border of the breast bone down to the pubic bone to expose the abdominal aorta and the aneurysm so that the graft can be directly implanted. The operation requires a general anesthesia with a breathing tube, extensive intensive care unit monitoring in the immediate postoperative period, along with blood transfusions and stomach and bladder tubes. All of this imposes stress on the cardiovascular system. Also associated with this procedure are well recognized morbidity (15%) and mortality (2-7%) rates. See Ernst, C. B. “Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,” <i>New England J. Med., </i>Vol.328:1167-1172 (Apr. 22, 1993).</p>
    <p>Today, there is the potential for a significantly less invasive clinical approach to aneurysm repair known as endovascular grafting. Parodi et al. provide one of the first clinical descriptions of this therapy. Parodi, J. C., et al., “Transfemoral Intraluminal Graft Implantation for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,” 5 <i>Annals of Vascular Surgery </i>491 (1991). Endovascular grafting involves the transluminal placement of a prosthetic arterial graft in the endoluminal position (within the lumen of the artery). By this method, the graft is attached to the internal surface of an arterial wall by means of attachment devices (expandable stents), one above the aneurysm and a second stent below the aneurysm.</p>
    <p>Stents are devices that permit fixation of a graft to the internal surface of an arterial wall without sewing. Expansion of radially expandable stents is conventionally accomplished by dilating a balloon at the distal end of a balloon catheter. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,337, Palmaz describes a balloon-expandable stent which has received the greatest experimental and clinical application for endovascular treatments. Also known are self expanding stents, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,655,771 to Wallsten. These patents are hereby incorporated in their entireties, by reference.</p>
    <p>Attachment of the stents above and below the aneurysm is a conceptually straightforward procedure when the aortic aneurysm is limited to the abdominal aorta and there are significant portions of normal tissue above and below the aneurysm (see FIG. <b>1</b>). Unfortunately, 40-60% of aneurysms do not have suitable neck portions of normal tissue at the caudal portion (farthest from the head) of the aorta. Also, the severe tortuosity of the iliac arteries and the marked angulation of the aortoiliac junction compound the difficulty of fixing the stent in the caudal portion of the aorta. This situation is only exacerbated by the tendency of the abdominal aortic artery to elongate caudally during aneurysm formation. For want of sufficient normal aortic tissue to suitably attach a prosthetic graft at the caudal end of an aneurysm, or because of extension of the aneurysmal sac into the iliac arteries, bifurcated grafts have been developed that comprise a single body terminating with two limbs.</p>
    <p>As a therapy to bypass an abdominal aortic aneurysm as well as any associated common iliac aneurysms, endoluminal deployment of a conventional bifurcated graft has presented significant issues to clinical operators in the field, primarily with respect to the positioning of one of the limbs of the graft in the contralateral iliac artery. The contralateral iliac artery is the artery that the conventional endoluminal bifurcated graft is not being advanced through. This procedure requires that both limbs of the graft be inserted into one branch of the femoral arterial system before being drawn or pulled over to the contralateral branch. This is to ensure that the graft is suitably positioned within the aorta and each of the right and left common iliac arteries. Even when tightly packaged, the bifurcated graft is a bulky device to advance through an often narrow single iliac artery.</p>
    <p>The process of pulling or drawing one limb of the graft to the contralateral artery is time consuming and increases the risk of procedural complications, such as twisting and kinking of the graft-limb and injury to the vessel wall which can result in micro-embolization. As one limb of the graft is pulled across the frequently tortuous and twisted iliac artery anatomy, the graft may twist or kink. Any graft twist or kink may reduce or entirely cut-off blood flow to the arterial tree downstream thereof.</p>
    <p>The procedure of drawing one limb of the prosthetic graft from one branch of the arterial system to the contralateral branch requires significant and skillful wire catheter manipulation within the aneurysmal cavity. See, for example, Chuter T. A. M., et al., “Transfemoral Endovascular Aortic Graft Placement,” J. of <i>Vascular Surgery </i>18:185-197, at 188-190 (August, 1993). This procedure may result in micro-embolization of clots which are known to form within aneurysmal sacs. If these clots are disturbed or dislodged from the aortic aneurysm, they may break up into small fragments and flow downstream to other arteries. The excessive wire manipulation may also induce “churning” within the aneurysmal cavity which can cause proximal reflux or retrograde flow of thrombotic or embolic material into the arteries that supply circulation to the kidneys, intestines and the liver.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, there exists a need for a method for safely and effectively bypassing an aneurysm, such as an abdominal aortic aneurysm, located at or extending into a bifurcation in the vasculature, such as the common iliac arteries. There also exists a need for an attachment device that permits the collateral deployment of stents as mirror image pairs, as well as an apparatus for deploying such an attachment device.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>These and other needs are addressed, according to one aspect of the invention, by a method of endoluminally bypassing blood flow through an aneurysm. The method comprises the steps of advancing a graftstent complex through each branch of the branched blood vessel, aligning the cephalic stents of each of the graftstent complexes relative to each other in a common vessel above the aneurysm, and deploying each of the aligned cephalic stents in the common vessel. When the aneurysm is in the aortic artery, the graftstent complexes are advanced through the femoral and iliac arterial system and the cephalic stents are aligned in a common region of normal aortic tissue above the aneurysm. The alignment step may further comprise rotationally orienting the stents so that an alignment surface on each stent engages the other stent when the stents are deployed. Of course, the method may be performed in passageways other than those that form the arterial system, and may be performed by advancing the graftstent complex from a common passageway to a branched passageway. When the inventive method is performed in the vascular system, the deployed vascular stents are preferably expanded in a non-circular configuration, for example, in a generally “D” shaped configuration, and may be expanded simultaneously. The deployed stents preferably hemostatically seal the graftstent complexes to the common vessel wall and to each other so that blood is excluded from the aneurysmal cavity.</p>
    <p>The invention also provides an apparatus for rotationally aligning a pair of indwelling stents mounted on separate catheter shafts. The shafts rotatably support the indwelling stents. The apparatus includes an indicating means on a proximal portion of each of the shafts for indicating the relative rotational orientation of the stents. Rotation of the proximal portion of the shafts provides a corresponding rotation of the stents, so that the relative rotational orientation of the indwelling stents is indicated by the proximal indicating means. In one embodiment, the indicating means comprises a marker on the proximal end of each of the shafts.</p>
    <p>The invention also provides an apparatus that radially expands a vascular stent into a non-circular configuration. The apparatus comprises a member which is movably mounted with respect to a catheter, a deployment wire connected to the member for axially moving the member with respect to the catheter, and a plurality of wings which partially surround the member to form a support surface for the stent. The apparatus expands the stent into a non-circular configuration through a connection of a plurality of first and second arms which are of different lengths. Each of the wings is pivotally connected to a rigid portion on the catheter by one of the first and second arms so that the wings connected to the first arms displace radially outwardly more than the wings connected to the second arms when the movable member is moved axially by the deployment wire. This apparatus may also be used for collaterally deploying a pair of stents within a common body lumen.</p>
    <p>The invention also provides in combination with an expandable prosthesis an apparatus for deploying the expandable prosthesis with a non-circular cross-section at a site within a body lumen. The apparatus includes a support for supporting the expandable prosthesis while being delivered to the site within the body lumen, and a radially displaceable mechanical linkage connected to the support. The linkage expands the prosthesis to a non-circular cross-section when displaced radially outward and is adapted to deploy the expandable prosthesis when radially displaced. The linkage permits continuous fluid flow within the body lumen while the expandable prosthesis is being deployed.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an expanded vascular stent which has a non-circular cross-section. The vascular stent may be of the self-expanding variety, and preferably has a generally “D” shaped configuration. In the preferred embodiment, the “D” shaped stent has a curved edge and an alignment edge. The curved edge engages a body lumen when expanded, whereas the alignment edge engages a collaterally expanded vascular stent. A segment of graft material having at least one end cut on a bias is attached to the stent so that the graft material extends substantially between the proximal and distal ends of the stent along the alignment edge, yet only partially along the curved edge. This advantageously assists in hemostatically sealing the bypassed aneurysm from the patient's blood flow.</p>
    <p>According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a graftstent complex for hemostatically bypassing an aneurysm is provided. The graftstent complex comprises a segment of graft material, a balloon-expandable stent, and a self-expanding stent. The segment of graft material is attached at one end to the balloon-expandable stent and at another end to the selfexpanding stent. The graftstent complex may have the segment of graft material cut on a bias, as noted above.</p>
    <p>These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be to readily apparent from the following detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <heading>DEFINITIONS</heading> <p>The terms “distal” and “proximal” as used in this specification refer only to the catheter device itself and the stents being deployed, but not to the vasculature. The present method contemplates advancement of a catheter in a retrograde manner (against the flow of blood). Therefore, as the catheter is advanced distally from, for example, the femoral artery, it advances to a more proximal portion of the vasculature with respect to the heart, as understood by those skilled in the art. Thus, to avoid ambiguity, the vasculature is referred to with respect to the cephalic (closer to head) and caudal (further from head) directions. Also, as used in this description and in the claims, the term “above”, in the context of relative positioning with respect to the aneurysm, refers to the region cephalic of the aneurysm, for example, within the aorta, whereas “below” refers to the region of the vasculature caudal of the aneurysm, for example, within the common iliac arteries.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention provides a method and apparatus for treating aortic aneurysms which extend to the aortoiliac junction without a suitable region at the junction of the aorta and the iliac arteries for seating a stent or other attachment device. By seating, it is meant that the graft is implanted, fixed or otherwise attached to the vasculature. By way of overview and introduction, the present inventive method and apparatus provide separate grafts to the aorta through each branch of the iliac arterial system. These grafts are unified upon deployment to form a new, double barrel, bifurcated graft in the vicinity of the renal arteries.</p>
    <p>Conventional procedures are discussed first to provide a better appreciation for the clinical situations that would benefit from the use of the method and apparatus of the present invention.</p>
    <p>A. Prior Art Techniques</p>
    <p>In FIG. 1 there is a diagram of a vascular system that depicts, in part, the arterial system in the vicinity of the abdominal aorta. In order to use a tubular endoluminal graft, a sufficient length of normal artery both above and below an aortic aneurysm <b>40</b> is required so that a graftstent complex <b>44</b> can be effectively seated or attached. The graftstent complex <b>44</b> comprises a thin-walled, crimped, knitted graft <b>46</b> of polyester, expandable polytetrafluoroethelyne (ePTFE), or similar material that overlaps and is sutured to at least a cephalic stent <b>48</b>. As shown in the Figures, the graftstent complex <b>44</b> further includes a caudal stent <b>49</b>, but the invention has application with a graftstent complex <b>44</b> having only one stent, e.g., the stent <b>48</b>. Suitable vascular grafts that may be used include Model 80S07TW by Impra, of Tempe, Arizona; and Model VT06070L by Gortex, of Flagstaff, Arizona. One stent usable with the invention is the stent described in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/278,546 of Marin et al., filed on Jul. 19, 1994, for INTRALUMINAL STENT, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>As is depicted in FIG. 1, a stent <b>48</b> anchors the tubular endoluminal graft above the aneurysm at point A and another stent <b>49</b> below the aneurysm at point B. When the length of the neck is insufficient to seat a stent at point B, a bifurcated device is necessary. The anatomic arrangement that would benefit from a bifurcated device is depicted in FIG. <b>1</b>A. Here, there is insufficient normal artery to seat the stent <b>49</b> at point C because of the aneurysms in the associated common iliac arteries.</p>
    <p>When the anatomic constraint of FIG. 1A is present, the standard vascular surgical approach requires that a bifurcated extraluminal graft procedure be performed. This procedure is performed by making a large abdominal incision from the breast-bone down to the pubic bone in the middle of the abdominal wall (not shown). The intestines are pushed aside and the aneurysm is approached directly where it sits adjacent to the spine, near the patient's back. With clamps placed above the aneurysm at point A and additional clamps placed on the iliac arteries at points D and E, blood flow is controlled so that an artificial graft <b>42</b> can be sewn into position as a new conduit to replace the diseased aorta <b>40</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>B. This procedure involves an extensive operation and recovery period, with an intensive care unit stay and a significant period of post procedure convalescence.</p>
    <p>It is difficult to safely endoluminally deploy a conventional bifurcated graft when the anatomic constraint of FIG. 1A is present. Because both limbs are inserted and advanced through a single branch of the femoral arterial system, one of the limbs must ultimately be pulled or drawn into the contralateral or opposite branch so that the graft is suitably positioned across both the aortic aneurysm and the associated common iliac aneurysms to supply circulation to each of the lower limbs. Importantly, bifurcated grafts are frequently too bulky to advance through a single iliac artery, especially in view of the fact that the graft-limb for the contralateral branch must be inserted together with the graft-limb of the ipsilateral branch. In addition, care must be taken to not twist or kink the graft as it is placed in the contralateral artery. The caudal portion of the graft must not stretch across the mouth of the internal iliac artery which would result in inadvertent occlusion of that artery (see point F). The procedure of drawing one limb of the prosthetic graft from one femoral artery to the contralateral femoral artery requires placement of a cross-femoral catheter <b>41</b> using a closable wire basket <b>43</b> prior to graft insertion (as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>C). This procedure requires significant and skillful wire catheter manipulation, frequently within the aneurysmal cavity. Meanwhile, care must be taken to avoid disturbing or dislodging thrombic or embolic material from within the aneurysmal sac. Additional factors such as the severe tortuosity of the iliac arteries and the marked angulation of the aortoiliac junction resulting from the tendency of the abdominal aortic artery to extend caudally during aneurysm formation combine to make deployment of endoluminal bifurcated grafts time consuming and at increased risk of procedural complications and failure.</p>
    <p>B. Method and Apparatus of the Present Invention</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 depicts the aneurysm <b>40</b> in the infrarenal aorta and the common iliac arteries. The infrarenal aorta is that portion of the aorta disposed caudal of the left and right renal arteries RA. It has been empirically observed that as much as eighty percent of all abdominal aortic aneurysms occur in the infrarenal aorta. Because the aneurysm extends through the aortoiliac junction, no normal aortic arterial tissue at the caudal end of the aorta is present to which a caudal stent may be secured. Conventional vascular surgical therapies for this anatomical arrangement have been noted above, along with the difficulties posed to operators performing endoluminal bypass procedures using conventional bifurcated grafts.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 2, the infrarenal aorta extends caudally to the common iliac arteries which branch left and right. In the Figures, elements introduced through the left branch of the patient's vasculature (the right side of FIGS. 2 and 3) have an “L” designation after their respective reference numerals and elements in the right branch have an “R” designation, and such elements are more generally referred to throughout this specification without such branch designations when there exists bilateral symmetry. Each common iliac artery further branches into the internal and external iliac arteries. The external iliac artery becomes the femoral artery below the inguinal ligament (not shown). In conventional manner, the femoral artery is entered within the thigh by an arterial incision where the vessel is close to the undersurface of the skin. A guide catheter is then introduced into the patient's vasculature.</p>
    <p>A guidewire <b>56</b> may now be endoluminally snaked through the guide catheter and beyond to a position G in the patient's thoracic aorta, above the aneurysm <b>40</b>. One suitable introducer catheter that may be used as the guide catheter is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/243,190 of Marin et al., filed May 13, 1994, for DEVICE FOR DELIVERING AND DEPLOYING INTRALUMINAL DEVICES, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. In particular, a conventional angiographic guidewire <b>56</b>L,R is inserted into each groin through incision points H and I, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. These incisions expose the common femoral arteries on the right and left sides. The guidewires are separately advanced until their distal ends are well above the aneurysm within the vasculature (point G). The guide wire <b>56</b> is at least 0.025 inches in diameter, and preferably 0.035 inches or more. The guide wire may be of tempered stainless steel and is conventionally covered with a synthetic material, such as TEFLON. The guidewire may remain in a fixed position throughout the endoluminal bypass procedure.</p>
    <p>After the guidewires <b>56</b>R and <b>56</b>L are in place, guidesheaths <b>58</b>R and <b>58</b>L are introduced through the incisions H and I in a conventional fashion until their distal ends are positioned just below the point of attachment for the cephalic stents. These guidesheaths <b>58</b>L,R function in conventional fashion to assist in positioning the deployment catheter within the patient's vasculature.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the invention, instead of using a single bifurcated graftstent complex, two individual graftstent complexes <b>44</b>L,R are introduced separately through the guidesheaths <b>58</b>L,R and deployed in such a way that the cephalic stents <b>48</b> are joined together to in effect form a bifurcated graft in situ. This is accomplished by loading individual graftstent complexes <b>44</b>L,R on separate deployment catheter shafts <b>60</b>L,R and introducing the catheters through incisions H and I, respectively, into the guidesheaths <b>58</b>L,R. Thus, with reference to FIG. 2, each of the graftstent complexes will be long enough to extend from attachment point A to attachment point J or K. In accordance with the presently preferred embodiment, each cephalic stent <b>48</b>L,R is positioned on a mechanically expanding deployment head <b>50</b>, as described below, but may also be deployed on a preshaped balloon <b>61</b>, for example, a balloon that expands in a non-circular configuration, and preferably a generally “D” shaped configuration.</p>
    <p>The deployment-catheters <b>60</b>L,R with the graftstent complexes <b>44</b>L,R mounted thereon are advanced through the guidesheaths <b>58</b>L,R, and the cephalic stents <b>48</b> are positioned adjacent each other at the desired point of attachment A. As described below, at that point, the two adjacent stents <b>48</b> are simultaneously deployed, in effect, forming a “double-D” configuration with the two cephalic stents <b>48</b> adhered to each other along a common surface and secured to the aorta at their outer circumference.</p>
    <p>After the cephalic stents <b>48</b> have been deployed, the caudal stents <b>49</b>L,R (FIG. 3) are positioned at the attachment points J and K. The caudal stents <b>49</b>L,R are preferably of the self-expanding type so that when the guidesheaths <b>58</b>L,R are withdrawn, the caudal stents <b>49</b> expand automatically to attach themselves at points J and K.</p>
    <p>The result, as shown in FIG. 3, is that the aneurysm <b>40</b> is bypassed by the graftstent complexes <b>44</b>L,R, which are hemostatically joined together by the cephalic stents <b>48</b> and are separately secured in each iliac arterial branch by the caudal stents <b>49</b>L,R.</p>
    <p>As indicated above, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, the cephalic stents <b>48</b>L,R are deployed by a mechanical device similar to the device shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/196,278 for APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DEPLOYMENT OF RADIALLY EXPANDABLE STENTS BY A MECHANICAL LINKAGE, filed Feb. 10, 1994, but modified to deploy the individual vascular stents in a manner such that when expanded, they are non-circular in cross-section, and preferably generally “D” shaped in cross section. Such a deployment device is described in detail below with reference to FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>With fluoroscopic assistance, the site for placing the cephalic stent <b>48</b> is defined, typically in the vicinity of point A, somewhat below point G, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. In each of the Figures, the cephalic stent corresponds to the stent located more distal from the respective point of incision than the caudal stent. An angiogram is also used to define the points for fixation of the caudal portion of each limb of the bifurcated graft, for example, in the vicinity of points J and K.</p>
    <p>The graftstent complex <b>44</b>R of a suitable predetermined length to bypass the aortic aneurysm and the right iliac artery aneurysm, may be mounted on a deployment head <b>50</b>R of a flexible catheter <b>60</b>R and covered with the guidesheath <b>58</b>R. Similarly, a graftstent complex <b>44</b>L which may be of a different length than the graftstent complex <b>44</b>R is mounted on a separate deployment head <b>50</b>L and covered with a guidesheath <b>58</b>L for deployment in the left arterial branch. The lengths of each graft <b>46</b>L,R is determined in accordance with preprocedural angiogram and computerized axial tomogram (CT scan) data, or otherwise.</p>
    <p>Once the necessary lengths of the grafts <b>46</b>L,R are known, suitable graftstent complexes <b>44</b>L,R may be loaded onto the deployment catheters <b>60</b>L,R for separate advancement to the site of the aneurysm. Each catheter shaft <b>60</b> includes the deployment head <b>50</b> at its distal end (see FIG. <b>7</b>). Each deployment catheter <b>60</b>L,R is separately advanced over the proximal end of a respective guidewire <b>56</b>L,R and passed through the groin incision for advancement to point A, above the aneurysm. A fluoroscopic image of the patient's abdominal cavity may assist locating the heads <b>50</b>L,R relative to the designated site. Where heads <b>50</b>L,R are formed of plastic or epoxy materials, they are advantageously provided with radiopaque portions to assist in the fluoroscopic alignment process. The guidesheaths <b>58</b>L,R are placed over each prosthesis for smooth delivery to the site of the aneurysm <b>40</b>. Once the heads <b>50</b>L,R have been advanced to a point above the aneurysm, the guidesheaths <b>58</b>L,R are pulled back by a sheath retractor (not shown) to expose the cephalic stents <b>48</b>L,R (FIG. <b>2</b>). Each of the guidesheaths <b>58</b>L,R is withdrawn prior to displacement of the wings. Thus, a graft which is smaller than permissible by conventional bifurcated graft designs transits through each iliac artery to the aorta to achieve isolated or separate reconstruction of each iliac artery. The reduced overall graft profile affords the operator a safer and smoother path through the tortuous arterial system.</p>
    <p>Because each graftstent complex <b>44</b> transits each iliac artery independently, there is no need for transfemoral crossover wires or catheter manipulations to draw one of the grafts <b>46</b>L or <b>46</b>R to the opposite side. This is distinctly different than other endoluminal bifurcated procedures, such as described above. As a result, the present invention affords reduced operative time and a safer simplified procedure.</p>
    <p>Once each head <b>50</b>L,R has been advanced to the designated site, a catheter mounting subassembly <b>200</b> located at the proximal end of each the shafts <b>60</b>L,R, is joined with a respective actuator subassembly to form assembled control mechanisms <b>54</b> (see FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>). These subassemblies are to ensure that the distention of the wings <b>52</b> is certain and precise, and are described below.</p>
    <p>The cephalic stents <b>48</b>L,R must be collaterally and rotationally aligned prior to their deployment. Collateral alignment is best determined by fluoroscopy or by intraluminal ultrasound. This involves positioning the cephalic stents <b>48</b>L,R in parallel within the vasculature relative to the head. Rotational alignment can be determined by fluoroscopy or by alignment markers located on, for example, the graft material <b>46</b>L,R or a proximal portion of each of the catheters <b>60</b>L,R, external to the patient. Alternatively, the stents <b>48</b>L,R may include a thickened portion as a marker. Other ways of providing markers are known to those skilled in the art. As discussed in further detail below, the heads <b>50</b>L,R are connected to the distal end of the catheter shafts <b>60</b>L,R. The catheter shafts <b>60</b>L,R are rotatably supported at their proximal ends by the nose cones <b>114</b>L,R of the control mechanisms <b>54</b>L,R. Rotation of the respective nose cones <b>114</b>L,R provides one-to-one corresponding rotation at the corresponding deployment head <b>50</b>L,R. Thus, an operator can rotationally align the separately advanced stents by means of markings on the proximal end of the shafts <b>60</b>L,R, external to the patient. FIG. 2 shows the stents <b>48</b>L,R collaterally aligned. FIG. 5 shows the same stents <b>48</b>L,R rotationally aligned.</p>
    <p>Once aligned, the stents <b>48</b>L,R are preferably simultaneously expanded by an actuator or control mechanism <b>54</b>. An actuator and deployment device used with the present invention is illustrated in the Figures and described below. A similar apparatus for expanding stents is generally described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/196,278 filed Feb. 10, 1994, the entire application being incorporated herein by reference. The actuator causes each of the deployment heads <b>50</b>L,R to expand cephalic stents <b>48</b>L,R beyond the elastic limit of the stent material, as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. The actuator can apply a force sufficient to restore a stenosed artery to its original, unstenosed diameter by flattening plaque or other embolic material. Each of the expanded stents <b>48</b>L,R creates a friction seal against the aortic wall and against the adjacent aligned stent.</p>
    <p>A significant feature of the deployment device as may be used with the present invention is that it expands stents into a non-circular, and preferably generally “D” shaped configuration. When rotationally aligned, as shown in FIGS. 5 (undeployed) and <b>6</b> (deployed), the pair of simultaneously expanded “D” shaped stents or cephalic stents <b>48</b> have their alignment edge portions, which may be generally straight, back-to-back frictionally engage one another whereas the curved edge component of the “D” shaped stents directly engage the underlying arterial wall to seal the grafts in position. The collaterally and rotationally aligned stents therefore form a bifurcated circular or oval configuration within the abdominal artery.</p>
    <p>It is preferred that the graft material <b>46</b> extend along the entire alignment edge of the “D” stent while only extending partially along the curved segment, as best seen in FIG. <b>6</b>A. FIG. 6A shows the graft material <b>46</b>L,R of each of the graftstent complexes <b>44</b>L,R cut on a bias. The stents <b>48</b>L,R are preferably rotationally aligned so that the graft material extending along the entire margin of the stent <b>48</b>L faces the graft material extending along the entire margin of the stent <b>48</b>R. Once deployed, the cloth-to-cloth union of the graft materials <b>46</b>L,R is believed to be more likely to clot and seal the graftstent complexes <b>44</b>L,R to one another, to the exclusion of the aneurysmal cavity <b>40</b> so as to prevent blood from flowing into the aneurysmal sac <b>40</b>. In this manner, a hemostatic seal may be achieved between the cephalic stents <b>48</b>L,R, once the stents have been deployed.</p>
    <p>Of course, the “D” stent need not have a straight edge. Other configurations would provide a significant surface for frictional engagement with the adjacent expanded stent, for example, sinusoidal, triangular, trapezoidal abutting edges.</p>
    <p>The individual “D” shaped stented grafts are preferably attached to one another and the body vessel by barbs which remain within the surface of the stent when the stent is in its unexpanded condition, but which extend from the surface of the stent when the stent is expanded. A suitable stent for this application is described in U.S. Application Serial No. unassigned of Marin et al., filed on Jul. 19, 1994, for INTRALUMINAL STENT. As the stent is deployed, the barbs are also deployed so that when the stent contacts the surface of the blood vessel the barbs penetrate the inner lining of the blood vessel to anchor the stent in place. At the same time, the barbs penetrate an adjacent graftstent complex <b>44</b>L or <b>44</b>R. This unifies the two individual prosthetic grafts as a single bifurcated graft sufficient to form a fluid tight seal therebetween and against the arterial wall. This stent design advantageously permits both a friction seal anchor at the time of deployment and provides a sharp puncture attachment into the arterial wall and into the graft material of the aligned adjacent stent. This provides adequate anchoring for both grafts to each other as well as each graft to the arterial wall. When graft material is provided along the entire margin of the expanded stent which abuts the other stent, one stent's barbs engage the covering graft material rather than the metal of the adjacent stent. This should provide a fluid tight seal between the two endoluminal grafts.</p>
    <p>Once both of the endoluminal grafts <b>44</b>L,R have been firmly fixed to each other and into the arterial wall above the aneurysm, the caudal end of each limb of the cephalically unified graft may be attached separately within each branch of the iliac arterial system. Fixation is preferably accomplished by means of self-expanding mesh-like stents, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,665,71 to Wallsten, but the invention is not so limited. Stents <b>49</b> may be the same type as stents <b>48</b>, or some other type known in the art. When loaded inside the guidesheath <b>58</b>, such stents exhibit a small, collapsed profile that is substantially equivalent to the inside diameter of the containing guidesheath. However, when the guidesheath <b>58</b> is withdrawn, the caudal stent self-expands in a spring-like manner to a relatively larger tubular structure. At point L in FIG. 3, the guidesheath <b>58</b> is shown partially withdrawn from the stent <b>49</b> in the left branch of the iliac artery, below the aneurysmal part of the vessel. The upper portion of the stent is illustrated as having a conical shape, the uppermost margin being fully expanded and its lower portions still being contained within the guidesheath <b>58</b> with a compressed profile. Referring now to point M in the right arterial branch for comparison, the stent has assumed its naturally larger, expanded configuration because the guidesheath <b>58</b>R has been entirely withdrawn from the stent <b>49</b>. This stent bears against normal tissue in the common iliac artery at J. Although not shown in the left branch, further withdrawal of the guidesheath <b>58</b>L beyond point L will permit the stent in the left branch to fully expand and fix the lower limb of the graft within the patient's vasculature.</p>
    <p>Once each of the self-expanding stents <b>49</b>L,R has been released, an arteriogram is performed to ensure that the grafts <b>46</b> are appropriately anchored to the arterial wall and that the aneurysm <b>40</b> is excluded from the circulation. A successfully deployed graftstent complex <b>44</b> will not permit blood to enter into the aneurismal sac <b>40</b>. At the completion of the procedure, the catheters, introducers and guidewires are removed and the incisions in the right and left femoral arteries are sutured by standard vascular surgical anastomosis techniques. The skin is then closed with standard skin closure procedures. It is anticipated that with miniaturization, this procedure could be performed by a percutaneous puncture of the artery.</p>
    <p>The mechanism of a preferred embodiment of the deployment head <b>50</b> is now explained with reference to FIGS. 4 through 13.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 shows a cross-sectional view of a body lumen <b>108</b> with the catheters <b>60</b>L,R disposed therein. Each catheter <b>60</b> terminates distally with the deployment head <b>50</b>. As illustrated, one of the deployment heads <b>50</b>L,R is rotated 180° with respect to the other, however, the deployment heads are otherwise identical. One of the deployment heads <b>50</b>L,R has been advanced through the body lumen <b>108</b> over the guidewire <b>56</b>R whereas the other has been advanced over the guidewire <b>56</b>L. The cephalic stent <b>48</b> is mounted on the deployment head <b>50</b> which has a support surface comprised of four radially displaceable wings <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b</i>, <b>52</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>52</b> <i>d </i>(see FIGS. <b>5</b> through <b>10</b>). All of the wings may be dimensionally the same. A graft material <b>46</b> is sewn at least to the cephalic stent <b>48</b> and preferably to the caudal stent <b>49</b> to form the graftstent complex <b>44</b>. The deployment head, stent and graft are recessed within the guidesheath <b>58</b> to facilitate noninjurious advancement and withdrawal of the catheter through the patient's vasculature. The guidesheath is withdrawn relative to the deployment head, as noted above, prior to deployment of the stents <b>48</b>L,R.</p>
    <p>The stents <b>48</b> may have an unexpanded diameter of three to five millimeters or less for delivery purposes. At the desired location, the stent on the head <b>50</b> is radially distended to an expanded diameter by a mechanical linkage actuated by the control mechanism <b>54</b>, described below. The radial expansion of the stent is continued until at least a part of it invaginates into an arterial wall and fastens itself by a friction seal, as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>. The wings may also be expanded so as to compress any deposits on the arterial wall which constrict the natural, unoccluded arterial diameter. As best seen in this Figure, the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>are further radially displaced within the body lumen than the wings <b>52</b> <i>c,d. </i> </p>
    <p>In FIG. 7, there is seen a longitudinal view of the head <b>50</b> which includes an annular support <b>59</b> press fit onto the distal end of an elongate flexible shaft <b>60</b>. The shaft <b>60</b> comprises a wire wound coil <b>66</b> surrounding a multilumen plastic catheter <b>68</b> (not shown). The catheter <b>68</b> permits axial movement of several control wires which extend into the head <b>50</b> (see FIG. 13) and into the control mechanism <b>54</b> (see FIG. <b>18</b>), as described below. The catheter <b>68</b> also has a central lumen <b>70</b> that receives the proximal end of the guide wire just before the head <b>50</b> is advanced into the patient's vasculature. The proximal end of shaft <b>60</b> is retained with the nose cone <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>The apparatus of the present invention deploys the stents <b>48</b> by radially displacing the wings <b>52</b> through a mechanical coupling that consists of a pair of arms <b>82</b>,<b>83</b> associated with each of the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>(shown in FIG. 8) and a mechanical coupling of the arms <b>84</b> associated with each of the wings <b>52</b> <i>c,d </i>(shown in FIG. <b>10</b>), together with a tubular slide <b>86</b> and an initiator <b>88</b>. The tubular slide and the initiator are axially slideably mounted with respect to the guide wire. In addition, the tubular slide <b>86</b> is connected to the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>by the arms <b>82</b> and the initiator <b>88</b> is commonly associated with each of the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b,c,d. </i>The distal ends of the arms <b>82</b> are pivotally attached to the distal end of the slide <b>86</b> by pins <b>96</b> through bifurcated lugs <b>94</b>. A deployment wire <b>80</b> (see FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b>) extends from the control mechanism <b>54</b> through the shaft <b>60</b> and, at its distal end, is tied to or looped through a hole in a lug <b>81</b> at the distal end of the slide <b>86</b> (see FIG. <b>5</b>). The proximal ends of the arms <b>82</b> are pivotally attached to the distal ends of the arms <b>83</b> and an intermediate part of a corresponding wing <b>52</b> <i>a,b, </i>by pins <b>118</b> (see FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b>). The proximal ends of the arms <b>83</b>,<b>84</b> are pivotally mounted to the annular support <b>59</b> by pins <b>120</b>, as best seen in the cross-sectional view of FIG. <b>13</b>. Hence, tension applied to the looped deployment wire <b>80</b> will cause the arms to buckle (FIG. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b>) which in turn deploys the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b,c,d </i>outwardly. The deployment wire <b>80</b> is anchored at its proximal ends, preferably, to a multiply ribbed anchor <b>90</b> (FIG. 17) that mates with the control mechanism <b>54</b> such that a calibrated force may be directly transmitted from the control mechanism <b>54</b> to the tubular slide by squeezing a trigger <b>92</b> to effect a radial displacement of the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b, </i>all while intraluminal fluid flow in the region of device deployment is minimally impeded within the patient's vascular system. The deployment wire <b>80</b> is capable of transmitting compressive forces, and preferably has a diameter of 0.014 inches or less. Thus, when the trigger <b>92</b> is released, the deployment wire moves axially toward the distal end of the head <b>50</b> thereby towing the tubular slide to its rest position and radially recoiling the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b. </i> </p>
    <p>In contrast to balloon based devices, therefore, the direct transmission of a physical force from the trigger <b>92</b> to the head <b>50</b> causes the device of the present invention to operate substantially instantaneously without the delays associated with the filling of a balloon. The mechanical device is readily adapted (as shown in the Figures) to expand a stent in a “D” shaped configuration. Notwithstanding the perceived advantages of using the deployment head <b>50</b> shown in FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>13</b>, the invention may be deployed by a balloon angioplasty catheter having an inflatable balloon portion that is preshaped to collaterally deploy a pair of stents <b>48</b>L,R. Preferably, the inflatable balloon <b>61</b> portion is preshaped in a generally “D” shaped configuration. The actual means used to deploy the collateral stents, however, is not critical to the inventive method.</p>
    <p>A slot <b>98</b> (FIG. 7) in each of the wings <b>52</b> accommodates the lugs <b>81</b>,<b>94</b> and the coupling arms <b>82</b> when the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b,c,d </i>are recoiled. This allows for a more compact profile of the head <b>50</b> for intraluminal delivery and removal after the surgical procedure is complete. The head <b>50</b> can be formed with a profile of approximately five millimeters.</p>
    <p>The head <b>50</b> includes the cylindrical initiator <b>88</b> for initiating the radial motion of the wings from their recoiled configuration, as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. This makes it easier to fully deploy the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b, </i>when tension is applied to the deployment wire <b>80</b>. An initiator wire <b>78</b>, which extends through the central lumen of the initiator <b>88</b>, is anchored to the initiator in a circumferential slot <b>100</b>, and is used to axially slide the initiator with respect to the arms <b>83</b>,<b>84</b> (see FIG. <b>12</b>). The slot <b>100</b> is preferably formed with a pair of opposing holes <b>102</b> through which the initiator wire <b>78</b> may be threaded and wrapped securely. A force applied to the proximal end of the initiator wire <b>78</b> by the control mechanism <b>54</b> slides the initiator <b>88</b> with respect to the guide wire <b>56</b>. Advancement of the initiator <b>88</b> toward the distal face of the annular support <b>59</b> causes it to engage sloped surfaces <b>104</b> of the arms <b>84</b> and sloped surfaces <b>103</b> of the arms <b>83</b>. Preferably, the sloped surfaces <b>103</b>,<b>104</b> have a 15° pitch. Continued proximal movement of the initiator <b>88</b> causes it to bear against the sloped surface of each arm <b>83</b>,<b>84</b>. In response to this pressure, each coupling arm <b>82</b>,<b>83</b>,<b>84</b> buckles slightly, i.e., the distal portions of the coupling arms pivot slightly away from the tubular slide <b>86</b> to initiate movement of each respectively coupled wing slightly radially outward, as perhaps best seen in FIG. 4 The coupling arms <b>82</b> of the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>similarly pivot about the lugs <b>94</b> while the tubular slide <b>86</b> is moved slightly toward the distal face of the annular support <b>59</b>. Advantageously, the portion of the initiator <b>88</b> that bears against the surfaces <b>103</b>,<b>104</b> is shaped as a frustrum so that frictional forces are minimized. Reduced frictional forces permit use of a thinner, more compact initiator wire <b>78</b>. Preferably, the initiator wire is 0.014 inches or less in diameter.</p>
    <p>For certain types of stent or attachment devices where low radial forces are required, only one deployment means may be required.</p>
    <p>After the initiator <b>88</b> has caused the arms <b>82</b>,<b>83</b>,<b>84</b> to buckle slightly and the slide <b>86</b> has started to move, the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>can be fully radially displaced, as shown in FIG. 9, by advancing the tubular slide <b>86</b> toward the distal face of the annular support <b>59</b> by squeezing the trigger <b>92</b> to apply tension to the deployment wire <b>80</b>. FIG. 6 shows the head <b>50</b> fully radially displaced within a body lumen <b>108</b>. Here, the tubular slide <b>86</b> has been retracted toward the distal face of the annular support <b>59</b>, as by the trigger <b>92</b>, to bow the coupling arms <b>82</b>,<b>83</b>,<b>84</b> outward and radially separate the wings. As the stent support surface separates with the radial motion of the wings, the stent deforms at four contact points <b>111</b> <i>a, </i> <b>111</b> <i>b, </i> <b>111</b> <i>c, </i>and <b>111</b> <i>d </i>into a “D” shaped configuration. The stent is anchored to the walls of the body lumen when the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>have dilated substantially to the diameter of the body lumen. Thus, if the body lumen <b>108</b> were the abdominal aortic artery, the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>would be dilated to approximately 35 to 40 mm. Because two stents are collaterally expanded, a mirror image of contact points <b>111</b> <i>f, g, h, </i>and <i>i, </i>are formed when the stents are suitably aligned. As a result, a double barrel “D” shaped circularly configured bifurcated graft forms a new aortic bifurcation in the vicinity of the renal arteries extending to the region of the internal iliac arteries (FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>).</p>
    <p>Each of the wings preferably has a stepped inner surface <b>116</b> to accommodate the coupling arms <b>82</b>,<b>83</b>,<b>84</b> (see FIG. <b>12</b>). Each wing also has a primary rib <b>122</b> at a distal end and a secondary rib <b>124</b> at a proximal end. A recess <b>126</b> between the wings holds the stent in place (see FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>9</b>).</p>
    <p>Advantageously, the head <b>50</b> and the shaft <b>60</b> form a delivery system that can be preconfigured with a particular graftstent complex <b>44</b> of suitable length for the procedure. However, because placement of the caudal stent <b>49</b> is adjusted in accordance with the particular anatomical requirements of the outflow artery, less rigorous length requirements are imposed for the selection of graft material prior to surgery. This may permit a reduced selection of graftstent complex lengths to choose between when selecting the graftstent complexes <b>44</b> for each branch of the iliac system.</p>
    <p>The maximum extent of expansion of the “D” stent, which occurs along the line described by the wings <b>52</b> <i>a, b </i>(which wings separate radially at an obtuse angle, preferably 134°), is directly controlled by the travel of the trigger <b>92</b> which governs the tubular slide <b>86</b>. This travel can be calibrated to a predetermined level of expansion, e.g., thirty-five mm. Once expanded to the predetermined size, after re-evaluation of the prosthesis positioning, the stent can be immediately redilatated to a larger size without the introduction of a new deployment head <b>50</b> or a catheter exchange. The linkage and wings are sufficiently rigid to dilate the stent, or a stenosis to the predetermined size regardless of the presence of plaque and the like. The stent can be incrementally dilated to larger sizes on a moment-by-moment basis depending on real time fluoroscopic images and the operator's discretion as a function of the actual arterial dimensions instead of relying on estimated dimensions that are conventionally made prior to the procedure using arteriography and CT scanning. This affords a decrease in blood loss during such redilation procedures and cuts down on the amount of time and cost involved with procedures which could potentially require multiple angioplasty catheter exchanges to appropriately dilate the stent. It also reduces the risk of graftstent migration which could occur during such balloon catheter exchanges.</p>
    <p>In FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>22</b>, there is seen the control mechanism <b>54</b> as may be used with the deployment devices inserted into each femoral artery. Several views are given so that the geometry of the control mechanism <b>54</b> can be better appreciated.</p>
    <p>Each control mechanism comprises a catheter mounting subassembly <b>200</b> and an actuator subassembly <b>202</b> (FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>). The catheter mounting subassembly comprises a plate <b>204</b> that supports the rotatable nose cone <b>114</b>, a multiply ribbed anchor <b>90</b> attached to the proximal end of the deployment wire <b>80</b>, and an anchor <b>242</b> attached to the proximal end of the initiator wire <b>78</b> (FIG. <b>21</b>). The catheter mounting subassembly mates with a first side <b>206</b> of the actuator subassembly <b>202</b> to form an assembled control mechanism <b>54</b>. A C-shaped retaining ring <b>208</b> is attached to the proximal end of the plate <b>204</b> by a pair of screws <b>210</b> to unite the mounting subassembly <b>200</b> with the nose cone <b>114</b>. The nose cone has a circumferential groove <b>212</b> (see FIG. 17) that permits it to be rotatably supported in the retaining ring <b>208</b> to the plate <b>204</b>. It is desirable to have the nose cone rotatably supported in the catheter mounting subassembly so that the head <b>50</b> can be rotated once located within a patient's body for redistending the stent at contact points other than where the stent is first distended. The nose cone is provided with a stop <b>214</b>, as shown in FIG. 16, that limits rotation to approximately 360°. A click stop (not shown) may be provided at regular intervals, for example, 45°, to provide a tactile indication of the amount of rotation brought about by rotation of the nose cone <b>114</b>. The multiply ribbed anchor <b>90</b> has at its distal end a cylindrical sleeve <b>91</b> that is slideably mounted in an annular recess <b>115</b> in the proximal face of the nose cone <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>Because the control mechanisms for each deployment head <b>50</b>L,R are identical, only one control mechanism <b>54</b> is described.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 18 and 19 show cross-sections of the mounting subassembly and the actuator subassembly before and after the control mechanism <b>54</b> is assembled, respectively. Assembly is facilitated by a peg <b>234</b> and a hole <b>232</b> complementarily formed on each of the mounting subassembly and the actuator subassembly, as shown in FIG. 18, to guide the catheter mounting subassembly and the actuator subassembly together. The shaft <b>60</b> is received in the control mechanism <b>54</b> by means of the catheter mounting subassembly <b>200</b> after the graftstent complex <b>44</b> has been loaded upon the shaft <b>60</b> and delivered to the desired location within a patient's vascular system. The mounting subassembly <b>200</b> is then secured to the actuator subassembly <b>202</b> to form a single mechanism as by the screws <b>236</b>, shown in FIG. 17, or by any other means to hold two components together. The mounting subassembly enables each head <b>50</b>L,R to be operated remotely by a respective trigger <b>92</b>L,R, yet further provides an automatic calibration of the distention of the stent, as described below.</p>
    <p>Advantageously, the travel of triggers <b>92</b> is calibrated to the radial motion of the wings so that dilation of the stent is certain and precise. The deployment wire <b>80</b>, which is coupled at its distal end to the tubular slide <b>86</b>, is rigidly coupled at its proximal end to the anchor <b>90</b> by a washer <b>238</b> and a nut <b>240</b> (see FIG. 17) so that a force applied to the anchor <b>90</b> by the trigger <b>92</b> is conveyed to the tubular slide <b>86</b> to displace the wings and distend any stent thereon. In similar manner, the initiator wire <b>78</b> coupled at its distal end to the initiator <b>88</b> is coupled at its proximal end to a spool-shaped anchor <b>242</b> by a washer <b>244</b> and a nut <b>246</b>. A force applied to the anchor <b>242</b> by the actuating lever <b>248</b> is thus conveyed to the initiator <b>88</b> to displace the wings slightly radially outward, as described above in connection with FIG. <b>8</b>. Thus, proximal motion of the initiator <b>88</b> causes the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b,c,d </i>to be slightly radially displaced.</p>
    <p>With further reference to FIGS. 18 through 20 and <b>22</b>, the trigger <b>92</b> is shown coupled to the anchor <b>90</b> by a slotted yoke slide <b>250</b> terminated at the distal end in a yoke <b>252</b>. The yoke <b>252</b> selectively engages multiply ribbed the anchor <b>90</b> between any one of several ribs when the catheter mounting subassembly is assembled with the actuator subassembly (see FIG. <b>22</b>). This is a self-zeroing control to account for cable bending, as more completely described in connection with the operation of the device. Thus, the actual set of ribs on the anchor <b>90</b> to which the yoke <b>252</b> engages is determined based on the orientation of the shaft <b>60</b> in the patient's body. This ensures that the yoke <b>252</b> engages the anchor <b>90</b> with the wings completely recoiled to provide the most compact profile achievable, yet permit the wings to maintain a calibrated position relative to the trigger <b>92</b>. A link pin <b>254</b> attached to the trigger engages one of a plurality of vertical slots <b>256</b> in the yoke slide <b>250</b> so that the travel of the trigger remains accurately calibrated to the force conveyed to anchor <b>90</b> which, in turn, governs the radial displacement or recoil of the wings. The trigger pivots on a pin <b>258</b> in an arcuate shaped milled recess <b>260</b> formed in the second side <b>224</b> of the actuator subassembly <b>202</b>. As the trigger pivots on the pin <b>258</b>, the link pin <b>254</b> travels in an arc along with the trigger. The link pin <b>254</b> draws the yoke slide <b>250</b> linearly forwards and backwards in the actuator subassembly <b>202</b> by engagement with the vertical slots <b>256</b>. The vertical slots <b>256</b> accommodate the arc traced by the link pin <b>254</b> as it travels with the trigger while translating the pivotal motion of the trigger into the linear motion of the yoke slide <b>250</b>. This pivotal motion is in response to a force applied to a grasp handle <b>262</b> which may be provided to ensure a firm control over the trigger.</p>
    <p>In operation, once each head <b>50</b> has been advanced to the designated site, the shaft <b>60</b> will likely have bends in it between its distal and proximal ends. These bends will pull on the initiator and the deployment wires <b>78</b>,<b>80</b> which in turn will axially reposition the anchors <b>90</b>,<b>242</b> with respect to the nose cone <b>114</b> at the proximal end of the shaft <b>60</b>. The degree of tortuosity typically is unique to each iliac branch and so the degree of bending of each the shaft <b>60</b> will likely be different. Nevertheless, the calibration of the holes <b>278</b> (see FIG. 17) remains intact because the deployment anchor <b>90</b> always engages the yoke <b>252</b> with the wings <b>52</b> in a completely recoiled stance when the catheter mounting subassembly is joined with the actuator subassembly. This is due to the multiply ribbed surface of the anchor <b>90</b> which engages the yoke <b>252</b> regardless of its axial position relative to the yoke <b>252</b> at the moment when the subassemblies are joined. In effect, this provides a built-in self-zeroing feature so that regardless of the tortuosity of the vasculature, each head <b>50</b> will be in its closed position when the stent is properly located.</p>
    <p>Between the trigger and the yoke slide <b>250</b> is a rack <b>280</b> terminated at one end with a yoke <b>282</b>. Rack <b>280</b> has an aperture <b>284</b> so that it can slide in the actuator subassembly <b>202</b> without contacting the pin <b>254</b> of the trigger <b>92</b>. The rack <b>280</b> has on a top margin thereof a set of teeth <b>286</b> that cooperate with a pinion gear <b>288</b> formed on one end of actuating lever <b>248</b>. The actuating lever <b>248</b> pivots about a pin <b>290</b> between a pair of lever stops <b>292</b> <i>a,b </i>(see FIG. <b>15</b>). From FIGS. 20 and 21, it is seen that as the actuating lever <b>248</b> pivots from <b>292</b> <i>a </i>to <b>292</b> <i>b</i>, the pinion gear <b>288</b> drives the rack <b>280</b> in an opposite direction and tows the anchor <b>242</b> therealong.</p>
    <p>An edge <b>264</b> of the trigger <b>92</b> is normally biased by a spring <b>266</b> into a forward position, away from a butt <b>268</b> of the actuator subassembly. The spring <b>266</b> is housed in a horizontal slot <b>270</b> and urges a disc <b>272</b> against the edge <b>264</b> in resistance to any force applied to the trigger. As part of a safety mechanism, the trigger <b>92</b> may include an aperture <b>274</b> for receiving a peg <b>276</b> from a corresponding hole in the actuator subassembly <b>202</b>. The peg <b>276</b> restrains the trigger from pivotal motion until removed from the aperture <b>274</b>. A set of peg holes <b>278</b> extending toward the butt <b>268</b> is shown for limiting the motion of the trigger to the hole in which the peg <b>276</b> has been placed. Advantageously, each of the holes <b>278</b> is calibrated to the relative displacement of the wings so that the holes <b>278</b> may be labeled, for example, <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and so on, to provide a millimeter scale of the distention of the stent upon squeezing the trigger to a particular one of the holes <b>278</b>.</p>
    <p>The control mechanism <b>54</b> includes a trigger lock mechanism that restrains the trigger from pivotal motion unless a button <b>300</b> on a top surface <b>302</b> of the control mechanism is first depressed. This button is attached to a lever lock <b>304</b> by a pivot <b>306</b> (FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>). The lever lock <b>304</b> pivots about a pivot pin <b>308</b> and is normally biased by a spring <b>310</b> into a locked position (see FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>22</b>). The spring <b>310</b> is connected between a pin <b>311</b> below the pivot pin <b>308</b> on the lever lock <b>304</b> and a post <b>312</b> disposed in a pair of slots <b>314</b> formed in the actuator subassembly <b>202</b>. A pin <b>316</b> (FIGS. 17 and 21) on the trigger <b>92</b> rests in a slot <b>318</b> formed in the lever lock <b>304</b> when lever lock is in its locked position. So long as the pin <b>316</b> is in the slot <b>318</b> (FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>20</b>), the trigger cannot pivot and the wings will remain in a recoiled position. When the button is depressed, however, the lever lock pivots about the pivot pin <b>308</b> and releases the trigger pin <b>316</b> from the slot <b>318</b>. With the trigger pin released, it can travel freely within an aperture <b>340</b> formed in the lever lock <b>304</b> while the trigger is being squeezed. Thus, the trigger <b>92</b> radially displaces the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>by the coupling of the trigger to the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>by way of the link pin <b>316</b>, the slotted yoke slide <b>250</b>, the yoke <b>252</b>, the multiply ribbed anchor <b>90</b>, the deployment wire <b>80</b>, the tubular slide <b>86</b>, and the coupling arms <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p>By means of an angiogram and a CT scan the operator can determine the length of the aneurysm and obtain an indication of the lumen width in the region surrounding the aneurysm. This indication of lumen width is advantageously used to set the maximum travel of the trigger <b>92</b> by setting the peg <b>276</b> in an appropriate one of the calibrated holes <b>278</b>. Once the amount of distention is known, a suitable stent or graftstent complex may be selected. The entire graftstent <b>44</b> can be prefabricated and mounted on the head <b>50</b> in a manner ready for connection to the actuator subassembly <b>202</b> and subsequent deployment; a surgeon need only specify the length of the graft <b>46</b> necessary to bypass an aneurysm and the maximum distention desired of the stents <b>48</b>L,R.</p>
    <p>In operation, the actuating lever <b>248</b> is advanced from the lever stop <b>292</b> <i>a </i>to <b>292</b> <i>b </i>to draw the initiator <b>88</b> toward the annular support <b>59</b> and to separate the wings slightly radially. The trigger lock button <b>300</b> can then be released and the trigger <b>92</b> compressed toward the butt <b>268</b> to draw the tubular slide <b>86</b> toward the annular support <b>59</b> and displace the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b. </i>As the wings <b>52</b> <i>a,b </i>displace radially outward, the distance between each wing increases and the stent, supported on the wings, assumes a radially expanded circumstance in a “D” shaped configuration. The trigger <b>92</b> may be squeezed until it hits the peg <b>276</b> (FIG. <b>21</b>). At that point, the stents <b>48</b>L,R may be expanded sufficiently to anchor them to the body lumen <b>108</b> and to each other by friction. When a barbed stent is used, the stents <b>48</b>L,R engage each other through the graft material <b>46</b>L,R more securely. Either of the stents <b>48</b>L,R can be incrementally dilated to a larger size by removing the peg <b>276</b> and squeezing the trigger <b>92</b> beyond the hole <b>278</b> that the peg <b>276</b> formerly occupied. This may be done on a moment-by-moment basis depending on real time fluoroscopic images and the operator's discretion as a function of the actual arterial dimensions. When the trigger is released, the spring <b>266</b> urges the trigger to its rest position which conveys a pushing force through the yoke <b>252</b> and the deployment wires <b>80</b> to the tubular slide <b>86</b>. When the tubular slide <b>86</b> is pushed away from the annular support <b>59</b>, the wings return to a radially recoiled stance and the stents <b>48</b>L,R retain their radially expanded “D” shaped configuration.</p>
    <p>To rotationally align the collateral stents <b>48</b> on each deployment head <b>50</b>, the nose cone <b>114</b> is rotated until the markers <b>115</b> face each other (see FIG. <b>14</b>). Rotation of the nose cone <b>114</b> faithfully turns the shaft <b>60</b> and the head <b>50</b> at the distal end of the shaft in substantially a one-to-one ratio, thereby rotating one of heads <b>50</b>L,R with respect to the other within the body lumen <b>108</b>. Once the stents <b>48</b>L,R are rotationally aligned, the trigger <b>92</b> is squeezed to distend the wings <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>The position of the caudal stents <b>49</b>L,R are preferably adjusted prior to their deployment. Adjustment of each caudal stent <b>49</b> may be accomplished by withdrawing a respective deployment head <b>50</b>L,R until it is just proximal to either of (caudal) stents <b>49</b>L,R. This may be accomplished with the assistance of a fluoroscopic image of the patient's abdominal cavity. Once the deployment heads <b>50</b> have been withdrawn to this position, expansion of the wings <b>52</b> is initiated using the actuating lever <b>248</b>. The heads <b>50</b> form a shelf to support the proximal margin of stents <b>49</b>L,R. The heads <b>50</b> can then be slowly advanced distally (cephalically) to engage the proximal margin of each stent <b>49</b>, as illustrated in FIG. <b>4</b>. With deployment head <b>50</b> in a partially expanded state, wings <b>52</b> can urge the stent <b>49</b> into position while the stent is still within a respective guidesheath <b>58</b>L,R. This may be necessary when stent <b>49</b> would otherwise block the mouth of the internal iliac artery (point F). Once each caudal stent <b>49</b>L,R is located in an appropriate position, the deployment head <b>50</b>L,R is held in position while guidesheath <b>58</b>L,R is withdrawn proximally (caudally). In this manner, head <b>50</b> provides a shelf-like surface to restrain proximal (caudal) movement of the caudal stent while the caudal stent <b>49</b> is permitted to return to its naturally expanded tubular form. Once expanded, the stent <b>49</b> frictionally engages the body lumen <b>108</b> within a common iliac artery. The graft material <b>46</b> is sewn or otherwise attached to the distal (cephalic) margin of the stent <b>49</b> to complete the graftstent complex <b>44</b> (which, in this example, comprises the stent <b>48</b>, the graft material <b>46</b>, and the stent <b>49</b>). As noted above, where the head <b>50</b> is formed of plastic or epoxy materials, it is advantageously provided with a radiopaque portion to assist in the fluoroscopic alignment process.</p>
    <p>The direct transmission of a physical force from the trigger <b>92</b> to the head <b>50</b> permits rapid displacement and recoil of the wings. Displacement and recoil can be performed in virtually less than a second, as compared to the time required for balloon dilatation which, in the case of relatively large balloons with conventionally sized inflation lumens, may be as much as twenty to thirty seconds and sometimes up to a minute. Relative to balloon based devices, therefore, the present invention operates substantially instantaneously without the delays associated with filling and emptying a balloon. All the while, intraluminal fluids flow between the radially displaced wings to the vasculature in the region of the device deployment.</p>
    <p>Each of wires <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> is preferably stainless steel. The head <b>50</b> may be produced in a disposable or non-disposable fashion. Where the head <b>50</b> is to be disposed of after usage, at least the wings <b>52</b>, the tubular slide <b>86</b>, the coupling arms <b>82</b>,<b>83</b>,<b>84</b>, the initiator <b>88</b>, and the annular support <b>59</b> may be compression molded or extruded from an epoxy material or plastic. The same components of the head <b>50</b> listed above are advantageously formed of stainless steel where the head <b>50</b> is intended to be reused in a subsequent procedure. One skilled in the art would recognize that the choice of materials for the head affects the radiopacity of the head. Thus, an epoxy or plastic head would be radiolucid as compared to a stainless steel head which would be radiopaque.</p>
    <p>The guidesheath <b>58</b> may be of a plastic or teflon material. Presently, the materials most commonly used as prosthetic arterial grafts are PTFE (“GORTEX”), expanded PTFE, and polyester (“DACRON”), however, other suitable grafts may be used with this device. No single prosthetic material has surfaced as being superior to others. Excellent results may also be achieved using a patient's own accessory vein, albeit with more imposition to the patient.</p>
    <p>The invention is intended for use in deploying stents and attachment devices, i.e., devices which may be attached to a body lumen such as an artery, for example to secure a graft in place, in the vicinity of a vasculature bifurcation. As used herein, the term “stent” is intended to also include such attachment devices. The invention can be used with any radially expandable stent, including stents that are partially self-expanding.</p>
    <p>While the foregoing description has been directed primarily to abdominal aortic aneurysms, which is the best mode contemplated, the invention has application in other portions of the vasculature, such as where a segment of arterial tissue in the vicinity of a vasculature bifurcation must be bypassed. By way of example, this may be at the aortic artery bifurcation, at the iliac artery bifurcation, and at the innominate artery bifurcation.</p>
    <p>Further, the invention has application in body passageways other than arteries which branch from a common passageway and require treatment in the vicinity of the branching passageways. For example, the invention has utility in the treatment of tracheal esophageal fistulae when the deployment heads <b>50</b> are introduced through a patient's mouth to isolate a pathological connection. The trachea and esophagus may be isolated by deploying on one side of the pathological connection the stents <b>49</b>L,R of the graftstent complexes <b>44</b> in the left and right bronchi and deploying the stents <b>48</b>L,R in the trachea on the other side. Similarly, a malignant obstruction in the trachea, for example, a cancer, may be excluded from the windpipe by deploying graftstent complexes <b>44</b> as previously described. As another example, the invention may be used to treat a stenosis or injury, for example, a hole, in the left or right ureter, by introducing the deployment heads <b>50</b>L,R through the urethra and deploying the stents <b>49</b>L,R at one end of the graftstent complexes <b>44</b> in a respective one of the left and right ureters and the stents <b>48</b>L,R at the other end within the urinary bladder. These examples are illustrative, and not exhaustive, of the many passageways in which the invention may be utilized.</p>
    <p>Of course, the portion of the graftstent complexes <b>44</b> that extend into branched passageways may be attached in the branched passageways prior to aligning and attaching the stents in a common passageway. Such a procedure is appropriate when the operator enters the body passageway at a location more proximal to the common passageway. Hence, when an operator cannulates the thoracic aorta as a method of gaining access to the aortic aneurysm <b>40</b>, the caudal portion of each graftstent complex <b>44</b>L,R is positioned within a respective one of the iliac arteries before the stents <b>48</b>L,R are aligned and deployed. If the graftstent complexes <b>44</b> include the caudal stents <b>49</b>L,R, then these stents are deployed or expanded in the iliac arteries prior to aligning and deploying the stents <b>48</b>L,R. Further, with reference to the foregoing exemplary applications,- it is contemplated that the caudal portions of the graftstent complexes <b>44</b> are positioned and deployed before positioning and deploying the cephalic stents <b>48</b>L,R in the treatment of tracheal esophageal fistulae, malignant tracheal obstructions, and ureteral dysfunctions.</p>
    <p>Hence, when the operator enters a body passageway from a common passageway, the pathological defect is isolated by advancing a pair of graftstent complexes, which have been previously loaded on catheter devices, along a pair of guidewires which have been previously positioned in branched passageways which communicate with the common passageway. The graftstent complexes include at least a stent and a portion of graft material; however, it is preferred that the graftstent complexes include a pair of stents <b>48</b>,<b>49</b>, one connected to each end of the graft.</p>
    <p>When two stents are provided for each graftstent complex, a first stent (here <b>49</b>L,R) is deployed in each of the branched passageways to secure the graftstent complexes on one side of the pathological defect within the branched passageways. The stents may be positioned, for example, so as to not stretch across the ostium of another passageway branching from the branched passageway, or so as to extend beyond the pathological defect to one side of the defect. This may be accomplished as described above in connection with FIG. <b>4</b>. When present, the first stents are preferably of the self expanding variety, that is, they are mechanically or thermally activated, so that when guidesheath <b>58</b> is withdrawn, the stents expand into contact with the body passageway.</p>
    <p>The second stents of the graftstent complexes may be aligned within the common passageway, as through the use of markers, as previously described. Preferably, the second stents are coaxially positioned on the deployment heads <b>50</b>L,R by withdrawing each deployment head <b>50</b>L,R until the second stents pass over the secondary rib <b>124</b> of each wing <b>52</b>. It is preferred that the second stents (here stents <b>48</b>L,R) have an inside diameter that is greater than the diameter of the wings <b>52</b> at the radial cross-section of the secondary rib <b>124</b>, yet less than the diameter of the wings <b>52</b> at the radial cross-section of the primary rib <b>122</b> (see FIG. <b>7</b>), so that the second stents can readily be mounted on the wings <b>52</b>. However, radiopaque or other markers can be used instead, or in addition, to ascertain whether the second stents have been coaxially positioned over the deployment member.</p>
    <p>Once aligned, these second stent are deployed on another side of the pathological defect so as to isolate fluid flow in the passageway from natural tissue. As a result of the procedure, the graftstent complex is secured across the pathological defect within the common and branched body passageways. The pathological defect may be, for example, an aneurysm or an occlusion such as a cancer.</p>
    <p>While the foregoing is a preferable mode of introducing a graftstent complex from a common passageway, other configurations are possible. For example, if a graftstent complex is introduced through a common passageway and advanced toward branched passageways of the type in which fluid flows from in the direction of the branched passageways, for example, from the aorta to the iliac arteries, then the fluid flow, for example, blood, will naturally carry the graft over the guidewire and into position, without the need for a stent to be deployed in the branched passageways, nor the need for withdrawing a stent deployment means from the branched passageways. All that is required in this alternative configuration is that the graft be selected of a material and sidewall construction that resists collapsing and twisting.</p>
    <p>The “term” fluid as used herein is meant to embrace any gas that flows, for example, air.</p>
    <p>Although the invention is shown with one head deploying a single stent at a time, it is contemplated that two heads on a single device may simultaneously deploy two spaced apart stents.</p>
    <p>From the foregoing description, it will be clear that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The presently disclosed embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims, and not limited to the foregoing description.</p>
