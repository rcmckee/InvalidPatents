Channel-forming elements are in the form of surfaces, tubes, and structures with multiple channels and are rigidly positioned one relative to another with a spacing between supports such that the sagging of the channel-forming elements does not interfere with beam propagation. The device can be used to capture radiation from sources which produce parallel or divergent radiation. The resulting beam or beams can be of a variety of shapes or angular orientations including quasi-parallel, convergent, and split beams. Energy filtering is accomplished by selective absortion of radiation by the channel-forming elements and by selective reflection, by geometrics which cause some energies to be discriminated against because of the angle of total external reflection associated with that energy.</div>

    <p>This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 07/607,456, filed Oct. 31, 1990, and now abandoned.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates to devices for controlling radiation beams and, more specifically, to devices for controlling X-ray and gamma ray beams, and beams of charged particles and neutrons, and can be used to shape converging, diverging and quasi-parallel beams in a wide spectral range, at large aperture angles, and on short shaping paths.</p>
    <p>The invention can, for example, be used to control X-ray, gamma and neutron beams in medical radiography and radiotherapy, to shape beams for X-ray microanalyzers and X-ray diffraction analyzers, and to improve the efficiency of gamma ray utilization in Mossbauer examinations.</p>
    <p>A most advantageous application of this invention is to concentrate energy radiated by various sources with the objective of producing radiation beams with a high power density in a small area, e.g., to create oriented radiation detectors tuned to small size localized sources, for instance in radioastronomy.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Various devices are used to control particle, X-ray and gamma ray beams; these devices are based on radiation interference and diffraction, for instance Fresnel microzone plates, multilayer mirrors, and Bragg crystals. Also used for charged particle beam control are magnetic and electrostatic elements. A critical shortcoming of these devices is their narrow spectral band, principally due to the physical phenomena on which they are based.</p>
    <p>As is known, incidence of beams of various charged particles, neutrons, X-rays and gamma rays onto boundaries of condensed media, features a certain value of the grazing angle, called the critical angle of total external reflection, below which reflection is accompanied by very low losses. In the case of very smooth surfaces and low radiation absorption in the material of the reflective surface, the losses with total external reflection are so low that they allow efficient beam control via multiple reflections at angles below critical. Known in the art are devices functioning with multiple total external reflection in bent tube channels to concentrate and shape quasi-parallel beams of X-rays (Soviet Physics +Uspekhi, vol. 157, issue 3, Mar., 1989. V. A. Arkad'ev, A. I. Kolomijtsev, M. A. Kumakov, I. Yu, Ponomarev, I. A. Khodeyev, Yu. P. Chertov, I. M. Shakhparonov. "Wideband X-ray Optics With Wide-Angle Aperture", pp. 529-537).</p>
    <p>This prior art device for controlling beams of X-ray and gamma quanta, charged particles and neutrons, comprises a plurality of channels with inner surfaces featuring total external reflection, with input butt-ends facing a radiation source, and with output butt-ends directed at a radiation receiver. The channel-forming elements are located on the generatrices of imaginary coaxial barrel-shaped surfaces, and can, for instance, be bent tubes with longitudinal axes positioned along said generatrices.</p>
    <p>A shortcoming of this device is the considerable loss in radiation transfer efficiency along the tube channels, due to the inaccuracy of positioning of the tube channels along the generatrices of imaginary barrel-shaped surfaces and non-optimal orientation of the input and output butt-ends at the source and receiver of radiation, respectively. Another shortcoming is the device's relatively narrow spectral band which arises from non-optimal tube channel size. Attempting to optimize such prior art devices involves considerable engineering difficulties, inherent to the positioning of the particular channel-forming elements selected. These restrictions make device assembly a very labor consuming task and, in turn, place restrictions on the minimal channel size and possibility of reducing the beam control device dimensions, restrict the size of the minimal focal area and, thus, the efficiency of concentrating the radiation beam energy.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to improve the efficiency of radiation transfer along the channels of a beam control device.</p>
    <p>Another object of the invention is to expand the angular and spectral bands of radiation beams being controlled.</p>
    <p>Yet another object of the invention is to reduce the labor consumption of device manufacture, simplify its design and reduce its cost.</p>
    <p>It is yet another object of this invention to reduce the overall dimensions of the device, reduce the size of its focal area, and correspondingly increase the efficiency of beam energy concentration and beam power density at the device output.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it is an object of this invention to improve radiation beam uniformity at the device output and reduce the angular beam divergence.</p>
    <p>Also, it is an object of this invention to reduce the effects of background radiation on the radiation beams being shaped.</p>
    <p>These and other objects are achieved, in a device for controlling beams of particles, X-ray and gamma quanta having a plurality of channels with inner surfaces exhibiting multiple total external reflections, with input butt-ends facing a source of radiation, and with output butt-ends aimed at a radiation receiver, and in which the channels are formed by elements positioned along the generatrices of imaginary barrel-shaped coaxial surfaces, in accordance with the principles of this invention, by spatially locating the channel-forming elements with a rigid support structure, and by providing each channel with a channel width, D, in the radial direction at the input butt-end, meeting the condition:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">D<sub>1</sub> ≦2θ<sub>D</sub> F+D</pre>
    
    <p>where D<sub>1</sub> is the effective radiation source diameter from which radiation is captured by the lens, θ<sub>D</sub> is the minimum value of the critical total external reflection angle of the radiation in the desired spectral band, and F is the distance from the radiation source to the channel input butt-end, as measured along a central axis of beam propagation.</p>
    <p>In the case where the plurality of channels comprise bent tubes with longitudinal axes located along the generatrices of imaginary coaxial barrel-shaped surfaces, it is advantageous to implement the rigid support structure of the present invention with discs positioned normal to the central axis of beam propagation, and to provide each disc with a honeycomb pattern of apertures accommodating the tubes, thus, rigidly fixing the latter along generatrices of barrel-shaped surfaces. These rigid supports can take a number of forms, including solid plates with holes formed by processes such as lithography or laser machining, or a solid frame with wires or other items in patterns across the large opening at predetermined spacings along two or more directions in the plane, producing a grid.</p>
    <p>This approach ensures a high accuracy of the bent channel shape, its rigid location, minimal deviation of the curvature radius from its optimal value, and accurate and rigid aiming of the input and output butt-ends at the radiation source and receiver, respectively, thus providing maximal capture of the radiation into the channels and radiation transfer with minimal losses.</p>
    <p>In another aspect of the invention, individual one(s) of the discs may be made axially translatable relative to the other discs. This approach when applied, for example, to a disc nearest the input butt-ends provides adjustability of focal length and capture angle. Translatable supports are useful as well, for the ability to tune the transmission energy bandwidth and spectrum, and to adjust the beams focal spot size and exit focal length.</p>
    <p>In cases where the channels are formed by gaps between coaxial barrel-shaped beam reflective layers or envelopes, coaxial to the beam being controlled, the rigid support structure may comprise at least two rigid grids (of, for example, honeycomb pattern) positioned at the input and output butt-ends of the channels, normal to the beam axis, with the envelopes rigidly fitted to the grids by their butt-ends. The advantage of such a design is minimization of radiation intensity losses in the device's fixing structure, simplification of device assembly, lower weight of envelope reinforcement, and minimization of envelope deformation by the reinforcing structure.</p>
    <p>In embodiments employing bent tubes as the channel-forming elements, it is advantageous to position supporting discs with honeycomb patterns of apertures fixing the location of the bent tubes along the central axis of the controlled beam with a spacing of supports of L≦√12EI/(QR<sub>1</sub>), where E is the tube elasticity modulus at the maximum temperature the tubes will experience including possibly elevated temperatures due to radiation absorptions, I is the moment of inertia of the cross section of the tubes relative to the neutral axis, Q is the tube mass per unit length, and R<sub>1</sub> =2D/Q<sup>2</sup> is the critical tube curvature radius, as determined by the high-energy boundary of the required radiation spectrum. This minimizes tubes sagging under their own weight to an allowable curvature, at which the radiation intensity losses during radiation transfer along the channels is not excessive.</p>
    <p>In the event that the plurality of channels is designed as capillaries, it is another feature of this invention to group these latter into separate bundles with the longitudinal axes of the bundles positioned along generatrices of imaginary coaxial barrel-shaped surfaces, coaxial to the controlled beam's central axis, and to design the rigid support structure as discs positioned normal to the controlled beam axis and provided with honeycomb patterns of apertures to accommodate each of the capillary bundles. This design configuration is advantageous in that it allows expansion of the spectral band of the device due to a smaller diameter of the channels and a greater number of channels, whereas the labor content of assembling depends on the number of capillary bundles, rather than on the number of channels. It also reduces breakage due to the strength of the bundles compared to the strength of small individual capillaries. The device dimensions can also be reduced due to a lower critical curvature radius R<sub>1</sub> of the channels.</p>
    <p>In the case mentioned earlier, with the plurality of channels designed in the form of bent tubes with longitudinal axes located along generatrices of imaginary barrel-shaped surfaces coaxial to the central axis of the controlled beam, it is also possible, in accordance with the principles of the present invention, to form the rigid honeycomb pattern support structure out of the tube walls, rigidly linked by their external surfaces, making the channel width in each tube variable along the channel length and proportional to the corresponding dimension of the device at each cross section of the latter. This embodiment provides the advantage that the entire device can be formed by plastically deforming a bundle of tubes to have a larger channel size in the wide part of the device and making the channel diameter very small at the butt-ends oriented at the focal point. This can be done by methods such as drawing thermoplastically heated tube bundles. This approach allows reducing of the diameter of the focal area by several orders of magnitude, thus, correspondingly increasing radiation energy concentration. Once automated, this method will serve as a low cost method for manufacturing the invention.</p>
    <p>In another aspect of the present invention, where the plurality of channels comprise bent tubes having their longitudinal axes positioned along the generatrices of imaginary coaxial barrel-shaped surfaces, it is expedient to compose the rigid honeycomb pattern support structure of bushings encompassing each tube in a plane normal to the central axis of beam propagation, with the bushings rigidly fitted to one another to constitute a support with the aid of adhesive or interlocking mechanisms, or clamping devices (e.g., an outer band). This significantly simplifies assembling of the device and allows creation of devices with a substantially greater number of channel-forming elements, thus expanding the range of angular beam control.</p>
    <p>Similarly, it is also expedient, in the case where the plurality of channels are designed with capillaries, these latter being grouped into bundles with the longitudinal axes thereof positioned along the generatrices of imaginary coaxial barrel-shaped surfaces, to compose the rigid honeycomb pattern support structure of bushings encompassing each capillary bundle in a plane normal to the controlled beam axis and rigidly fitted to one another by adhesive or interlocking mechanisms or clamping devices. This allows simplifying the device assembly.</p>
    <p>Instead of bushings surrounding each tube or bundle of capillaries, coplanar stacked cradles can be employed to form the rigid support structure.</p>
    <p>The rigid support structure may be mounted for rotation, as a unit, around the central axis of beam propagation, thus allowing equalization of time-averaged radiation intensity along the beam cross section by averaging irregularities caused by beam transfer via separate channels.</p>
    <p>According to yet another aspect of this invention, it is suitable to have different length for different channels, selecting the lengths thereof in accordance with the required attenuation o the radiation intensity in each area of the cross section of the beam being shaped. This allows control of the radiation intensity along the cross section of the beam being shaped by canceling out irregularities caused by different intensity losses during radiation transfer via channels of different curvature. The most common use is to equalize beam intensity. Alternatively, an absorbing filter with a density or thickness varying over the cross sections; the most common use being a filter with absorptions falling off from its center to its periphery can be positioned in the beam path to accomplish the same purpose.</p>
    <p>It has further proven advantageous to make the individual elements diverging (e.g. conically diverging) with a taper angle θ<sub>1</sub> &lt;θ-D/L<sub>1</sub>, where θ is the required divergence angle of the quasi-parallel beam, and L<sub>1</sub> is the length of the tapered tube section. In this case, radiation transfer in the flared out channels is accompanied by beam divergence reduction to the value of the taper angle.</p>
    <p>In another aspect of the invention, the channel forming elements can be located along generatrices of imaginary coaxial surfaces of compound curvature. For instance, the output butt-ends of channels may be extended with channel-forming elements located along the generatrices of imaginary toroidal surfaces matched to corresponding ones of said barrel-shaped surfaces, with the output butt-ends oriented at the radiation receiver. This allows providing a higher density of radiation beams thus shaped.</p>
    <p>It is productionally effective to create the rigid support structure by filling the gaps between tubes with a compound. It is also suitable to provide the device with an external screening casing of a material opaque to the radiation of the controlled beam, with apertures in the casing aligned with the channel butt-ends, and employing only curved channels and radiation absorbing inter-tube material in order to block any straight line paths to an enclosed radiation receiver or source, thus reducing the share of background radiation in the radiation beams shaped. Such filling also reduces the susceptibility of the device to movement such as vibrations.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The device (also referred to as a Kumakhov lens) for controlling beams of particles, X-ray and gamma quanta, comprises a plurality of channels with inner surfaces featuring multiple total external reflections. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the channel-forming elements are bent hollow tubes 1. The longitudinal axes 2 of tubes 1 are located along the generatrices of imaginary barrel-shaped surfaces coaxial to central axis 3 of the controlled beam. The channel-forming elements are rigidly linked to one another by a rigid support structure.</p>
    <p>The rigid structure includes discs 4 positioned normal to axis 3 of the controlled beam. These discs are each provided with a honeycomb pattern of apertures 5, for receiving and supporting tubes 1 therein. In the honeycomb pattern, as shown in FIG. 2, each aperture is surrounded by six equally spaced nearest apertures, except for those apertures on the perimeter of the pattern. Other arrangements of apertures are possible, but this is preferred for most applications. The inter-aperture spacing on each disc 4 depends upon the intended axial position of the disc and is chosen so as to rigidly fix the positions of tubes 1 (FIG. 1) along the generatrices of barrel-shaped surfaces. Discs 4, which are made of rigid material (e.g. metal or rigid plastic or composite), are rigidly linked to one another by frame 6.</p>
    <p>The input butt-ends of bent tubes 1 face radiation source 7, and the output butt-ends are oriented at radiation receiver 8. Both sets of butt-ends are preferably arranged in hexagonal close packed formation, as illustrated in FIG. 3.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 1, in accordance with the present invention, the radial width D of each channel (the diameter of tube 1 at the input butt-end) is defined as:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">D<sub>1</sub> ≦2θ<sub>D</sub> F+D</pre>
    
    <p>where D<sub>1</sub> is the effective diameter of radiation source 7;</p>
    <p>θ<sub>D</sub> is the minimum critical angle of total external reflection in the spectral band specified; and</p>
    <p>F is the distance from radiation source 7 to the input butt-end of tubes 1 measured along central axis 3.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 depicts another embodiment of the present invention, wherein channels are formed by gaps between barrel-shaped beam reflective layers or envelopes 9, coaxial to the controlled beam axis 3. The rigid support structure comprises at least two grids 10 having, for example, honeycomb arrays of cells 11 (FIG. 5), positioned at the input and output butt-ends of the channels normal to controlled radiation beam axis 3. The rigid support member can be in shapes other than honeycomb, but should be carefully chosen as the blocked conditions can form an undesirable pattern in the beam. Envelopes 9 are rigidly fixed in space by being fitted to grids 10 by their butt-ends (for instance, by gluing), and grids 10 are fitted to support rings 12 which, in turn, are rigidly linked to one another by frame 6, as shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p>The radial width D of each channel in this embodiment is defined by the distance between two adjacent envelopes in the radial direction at the butt-end plane, as shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p>Referring again now to embodiments in which bent tubes serve as the channel forming elements, to improve the filling factor of the input cross section by tube 1 (FIG. 1) channels, the cross section of each of tubes 1 can advantageously be made triangular, rectangular, hexagonal or of other shape at which the filling factor of the device input cross section is maximal. The rigid support member may be in a shape other than honeycomb, but should be carefully chosen since blocked radiation can form an undesirable pattern in the beam.</p>
    <p>With uniformly bent tubes 1 with a channel of D size, even an originally parallel radiation beam injected into tube 1 is incident on the channel walls at angles ranging from zero to θ<sub>max</sub>, where θ<sub>max</sub> =(2D/R)<sup>1/2</sup>, R being the radius of tube 1 bend, so that each specific type and energy level of radiation features a so-called critical bending radius R<sub>1</sub> =2D/θ<sup>2</sup> <sub>D</sub>, below which the capture efficiency falls off proportional to R/R<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <p>In case of rectangular channels, this decay is linear; with cylindrical channels it follows a more complex law. In beam control devices local bends due to tube sagging under their own weight should be limited to R&gt;R<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <p>It is preferable to position discs 4 with honeycomb pattern located apertures 5 fixing bent tubes 1 along the controlled beam axis 3 with a spacing of supports of L≦(12EI/QU<sub>1</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>, where E is the elastic modulus of tubes 1, I is the moment of inertia of tube cross section relative to its neutral axis, Q is tube weight per unit length and R<sub>1</sub> is the critical bend radius of tubes 1, as defined by the high-energy boundary of the radiation. With such a positioning of discs 4, additional bending of tubes 1 under their own weight will not exceed a value required to retain total filling of the channels of tubes 1 by the radiation being transferred.</p>
    <p>Expansion of the operating spectral range of devices of this invention and their application to control neutron beams are related to the reduced critical angle of total external reflection and, correspondingly, to the necessity of reducing the diameter of tubes 1. At tube diameters below 100 μm, device assembly procedures become rather complicated.</p>
    <p>In the case of tubular channel-forming elements, it is advantageous to fabricate each tube 1 as a plurality of interconnected capillaries 13, with a smooth reflecting surface providing multiple total external reflections (FIG. 6 and FIG. 27). With this construction, the effective channel diameter can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. This facilitates operating spectral band expansion to the region of higher energies, and allows smaller bend radii of tubes 1 due to critical bend radius being here determined by the diameter of capillary channels 13, rather than by that of tube 1. Thus, the channel diameter may be reduced to sub-micron dimensions and the number of channels enlarged by several orders of magnitude, whereas the labor consumption of assembling the device is determined by the number of such multi-capillary tubes and is, therefore, retained at the level of the original tubular design.</p>
    <p>In embodiments where the plurality of channels is designed with bent tubes 1 (FIG. 1), with the longitudinal axes thereof positioned along generatrices of imaginary coaxial barrel-shaped surfaces, the rigid honeycomb structure may be implemented with bushings 20 encompassing each bent tube 1 in a plane normal to the controlled beam axis, as depicted in FIG. 7. The bushings are rigidly linked to one another such as by adhesive or interlocking mechanisms, or clamping mechanisms.</p>
    <p>Similarly, where the plurality of channels is embodied with capillaries 13 (FIG. 6) grouped into separate bundles, the longitudinal axes of which are positioned along generatrices of imaginary coaxial barrel-shaped surfaces, the rigid honeycomb structure may be in the form of bushings 21 (FIG. 8) enclosing each bundle of capillaries 13 in a plane normal to the controlled beam axis. Again, with the bushings rigidly linked to one another such as with adhesive or a bandage brace to form a yoke.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, tubes 1 (or bundles of capillaries 13) may be supported in desired position with rigidity secured stacked cradle members 22, as shown in FIG. 9.</p>
    <p>In the case of tubular channels, when it is desired to simplify assembly procedures, reduce the channel diameter in tubes 1 to a practicable minimum, and reduce the size of the beam concentration area, thus increasing the beam density in this area, the rigid honeycomb structure may be formed by the walls of tubes 1 rigidly fitted to one another by their external surfaces. This invention envisions fabrication of such a device with thermoplastic tubes, such as glass tubes (FIG. 10). This provides a variable channel width along the tube length, from D<sub>o</sub> at tube 1 butt-ends to D<sub>max</sub> at their middle sections, in this embodiment proportional to the diameter of the corresponding given tube barrel-shaped surface in each cross section of the latter. Under these conditions, the critical bend radius of tubes 1 is defined by the input diameter D<sub>o</sub>, because the incomplete filling of the channel cross section with the radiation being transferred between the device butt-ends is not critical in terms of transfer efficiency.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment depicted in FIG. 10, each tube 1 is bent along a curve approximating a circle arc, so that the radiation captured by its thin end at the device input is transferred via a flaring out and then, if necessary, tapering off channel by reflections from only a wall with positive Gaussian curvature and never arriving at the opposite wall, therefore retaining the range of grazing angles acquired at the device input till it arrives at the output, where, according to this invention, the diameter of tubes 1 is at least the input diameter D<sub>o</sub>, because in the opposite case it becomes impossible to avoid reflections from the opposite wall, leading to additional radiation losses due to the grazing angle exceeding the critical angle θ<sub>D</sub> a of total external reflections.</p>
    <p>The device of this invention can be used to shape quasi-parallel radiation beams for such applications as long-haul energy transmission (for instance, data transmission), transmission of images of the objects being irradiated without geometric distortions and Bragg radiation monochromatization with the aid of planar crystals. In a number of cases (for instance, in X-ray lithography), the radiation beam is required to be highly homogeneous and highly parallel. However, quasi-parallel beams shaped by multiple total external reflections in tubular systems exhibit non-uniform radiation distribution across the beam cross section due to the discrete nature of radiation transfer via separate tubes 1 (microinhomogeneity), with intensity falling off from the beam center to its edges due to a lower efficiency of radiation transfer at a higher curvature of tubes 1 (macroinhomogeneity).</p>
    <p>In cases when the inhomogeneity of the beam caused by discrete radiation transfer via a plurality of channels is critical, the rigid honeycomb structure, according to this invention, may be mounted rotatable around the controlled beam axis 3, so that the beam intensity can be equalized by averaging over the exposure time. This rotation can be accomplished, for example, with an externally driven circumferential gear set 23 as shown in FIG. 11, and can be used to shape quasi-parallel beams, for instance in X-ray lithography applications.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 illustrates an embodiment of the invention in which a support disc 4' near the input butt-ends of tubes 1 is axially translatable. A rod 24 acting through a worm gear mechanism 25 is employed to selectively translate disc 4' relative to stationary discs 4. Translation of disc 4' towards the input butt-ends serves to increase the focal length F and simultaneously decrease the capture angle θ. Movement in the opposite direction has the converse effect. This construction also allows for tuning of the transmission energy bandwidth and spectrum.</p>
    <p>With longitudinal axes of tube 1 channels oriented parallel to one another at the output, output beam irregularities caused by radiation transfer efficiency variations due to beam travel via channels of different curvature may be smoothed out by extending the channel output butt-ends with rectilinear sections 14 (FIG. 13) of uniform cross section along their entire length. The lengths of the rectilinear sections 14 being selected according to the required attenuation of the beam intensity in each area of the shaped beam cross section. In this case a reduced intensity at the center of the quasi-parallel beam is provided by additional radiation absorption in elongated tubes 1. Tubes 1 butt-ends can also be distributed non-uniformly at the output with a pitch falling off from the center to the periphery in accordance with the required intensity distribution. Another possibility envisaged is positioning an absorbing filter 40 (FIG. 13a) in the beam path, with a density or thickness falling off from its center to its periphery in accordance with the original non-uniformity of the shaped beam. Such a filter can be produced, for instance, by lithography by exposing a resist, selected according to the type of radiation, to the shaped quasi-parallel beam.</p>
    <p>Divergence of the radiation from individual channels which are forming the shaped beam does not exceed the critical angle θ<sub>D</sub> of total external reflection. If decreased divergence is necessary, this may be achieved by providing supplementary flaring out conical sections 15 (FIG. 14) of tubes 1 at the output, with the taper angle θ<sub>1</sub> &lt;θ-D/L<sub>1</sub>, where θ is the required divergence angle of the quasi-parallel beam and L<sub>1</sub>  is the length of conical sections 15. Beam travel via a flaring out channel reduces beam divergence down to the taper angle.</p>
    <p>Using uniformly bent tubes 1 to shape quasi-parallel beams does not allow the output butt-ends of tubes 1 to be positioned with spacings, approximating those of the input butt-ends and, therefore, it is suitable to produce a quasi-parallel beam by extending the output butt-ends with sections 16 (FIG. 15) located along generatrices of imaginary toroidal surfaces, conjugate with the original barrel-shaped surfaces, and by orienting the output butt-ends of sections 16 at the radiation receiver. In this case, separate parts of the quasi-parallel beam are brought together, thus increasing the density of the output quasi-parallel radiation beam. The channel forming members may be located along generatrices of coaxial surfaces having other compound curvatures, if desired.</p>
    <p>Devices with tubular channels can be designed with a rigid honeycomb structure of solidifying material 30 (FIG. 16) filling the gaps between tubes 1 and between discs 4. In certain applications, it may be possible to remove discs 4 completely and simply rely on the solidifying material to provide the desired support for tubes 1. Such a design arrangement is suitable for devices with a large number of thin tubes 1, since it is simpler in assembly, for instance with a porous polymer used as the solidifying material to fix parallel positioned tubes and forming the barrel shape by compressing inside a barrel-shaped casing. This design configuration can be considerably lighter due to the absence of supporting superstructure, and this may be important, for instance, when designing X-ray telescopes for use in space.</p>
    <p>Rigid and precise fixing of channel-forming elements, e.g. tubes 1 in discs 4 with honeycomb pattern positioned apertures 5, provides location of uniformly bent sections of channel-forming elements with a precise aiming of the channel input and output butt-ends at the source 7 and receiver 8 of the radiation, respectively. Meeting the condition D<sub>1</sub> ≦2θF+D ensures radiation incidence from any point of source 7 onto the channel walls at a grazing angle less than θ<sub>D</sub>, thus ensuring total external reflection of the radiation captured in the channel. A strictly fixed uniform bend of the channels facilitates retaining the radiation grazing angle relative to the channel walls and effective transfer of this radiation from the channel input to its output and its direction at radiation receiver 8.</p>
    <p>It is proposed to concentrate parallel radiation beams with the aid of the herein above described quasi-parallel beam shapers by simply reversing the direction thereof, such that the previously described "output" butt-ends are aimed at the original parallel beam and the former "input" butt-ends are directed at the focal point.</p>
    <p>Radiation monochromatization can be achieved by placing a crystal with planes at the Bragg angle relative to the quasi-parallel beam.</p>
    <p>In case of inadmissible high background radiation it is preferable, as illustrated in FIG. 17, to enclose the entire beam controlling device (support structure not shown), along with the radiation receiver 8 (or source 7), inside an external screening casing 17 of a material opaque to the controlled radiation, with apertures 18 and 19 aligned with the axes of the channels at the input and output butt-ends, respectively. In this embodiment, the channel forming element along central axis 3 may be either omitted or blocked, and the gaps between tubes 1 filled with radiation absorbing or blocking material 36, so that no straight line paths to receiver 8 are available for transmission of unwanted background radiation.</p>
    <p>The device for controlling beams of gamma and X-rays and particles is essentially a system of specifically oriented reflecting surfaces. Based on the total multiple internal reflections effect, the device allows transformation of diverging radiation from an isotropic source into a quasi-parallel beam, and also its focusing. The device may be designed as a bundle of bent glass tubes, or as a system or superimposed coaxial "barrel-shaped" reflecting surfaces.</p>
    <p>The device provides control of gamma and X-ray radiation with the energy ranging from 1×10<sup>2</sup> eV to 1×10<sup>7</sup> eV, at radiation capture angles from an isotropic source ranging from a hundredth to several tens of degrees, depending on the radiation energy. The divergence of a quasi-parallel beam does not exceed the critical reflection angle, and can be as small as 10<sup>-4</sup> radians. When used to focus the radiation, the concentration of gamma and X-rays or particles in the focal spot can be tens of thousands of times higher than would be the intensity at that position without the focusing optics. The focal spot diameter is limited by the diameter of the focusing tubes and can be as small as 10<sup>-8</sup> cm.</p>
    <p>This device may be used to create qualitatively novel instruments for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications.</p>
    <p>Embodiments employing a system of layers of bent tubes feature channels of identical length in a given layer with channel lengths in adjacent layers chosen to provide similar transmission characteristics. Furthermore, these X-ray waveguides and particle guides are oriented relative to the incident radiation, so that the beam grazing angle at the channel walls does not exceed the angle of total external reflection. The number of reflections of the beam from the guide increases with the distance from the beam central axis, resulting in the beam being turned by a wide angle. These features facilitate beam focusing and larger beam capture angles.</p>
    <p>The device design is simplified and the accuracy of its assembling is improved by supplementing the system with discs (or other equivalent supporting structures), the apertures of which accommodate the tube radiation guides, with the distance between these discs and the lengths of the free radiation guide ends being subject to the previously described restrictive conditions.</p>
    <p>Transition from the system designed with a bundle of radiation guides to a system comprising a plurality of superimposed second order surfaces separated by gaps provides a design, better adapted to streamlined production, with lower assembling and production labor requirements. Furthermore, this design allows producing focal spots of smaller size and reduces beam energy losses during radiation transmission via the system.</p>
    <p>Making the system elongated and contracted at the side opposite to the radiation source, and ensuring that the tangent to the second order surface at the inflection point is at an angle less than the critical reflection angle allows the density of quasi-parallel beams to be substantially increased.</p>
    <p>Such design embodiments of the device are equally effective in providing radiation beam control capabilities and can be used to design competitive instruments and equipment.</p>
    <p>One of the most important sources of high-energy photons is a synchrotron. Synchrotron radiation is radiation emitted when charged particles are accelerated by deflection in a curved path. The energy of the radiation depends on the electron or positron energy and the radius of bending. In general, synchrotron sources are designed to produce radiation in the vacuum ultra violet range and X-ray range of the spectrum. Although the Kumakhov Lens can in principle operate with photon energy as low as 0.1 keV (λ˜100 Å), they are primarily designed for higher energy photons in the range from 0.5 to 1 Mev (λ˜0.01 Å). The Kumakhov lens also works with some types of particles, but the synchrotron is not a source of particles. The primary interest in this radiation source is the very high intensity and broad and continuous energy range possible. The X-ray intensity is determined by the number (current) of electrons (or positrons) circulating in the storage ring and the radius of curvature of the deflection. Both the photon intensity and energy are enhanced by the use of wigglers or undulators which cause the beam to oscillate in the vertical plane with a small amplitude and high frequency by the use of periodic magnetic electrostatic fields of alternating sign. The photon energy spread is continuous from very low energy (visible) up to a maximum.</p>
    <p>The radiation from a synchrotron is in the form of a fan of photons from each sharp bend in the particle storage ring. The height of the fan is normally 0.5-2 mm. The width of the fan may be several degrees. For example, on the National Synchrotron Light Source the width of the fan at each position is 6 degrees--so from each port through a thin beryllium window emerges a fan of 6°×1 mm wide; highly parallel in the vertical direction--divergent in the horizontal direction. In order to use this radiation as efficiently as possible--several beam lines are crowded into this narrow angular range, each capturing a degree or so of the radiation fan. The limitation in use of the radiation is often physical space to allow the beam monochromators, deflection mirrors, and equipment to exist within the 6° wedge. To gain space, the beam lines often become very long--with resultant decrease of beam intensity because of the horizontal divergence.</p>
    <p>A non-coaxial lens may be used with point sources and coaxial lenses and non-coaxial lenses used with parallel sources (e.g., a synchrotron), quasi-parallel sources, and extended sources, together with the sources, stated above. However, this technology is in no way limited to coaxial lenses used with point sources. For synchrotrons, the input end of the lens device usually needs to be aligned with the direction of the X-rays entering them, whereas with a point source all channels are oriented towards a point, with a parallel beam the input ends will normally be parallel. And for a dispersed source which is isotropically divergent from each point, the input channels can be parallel, oriented at a single point on the source, or any angle in between.</p>
    <p>Synchrotron beams diverge in the horizontal plane (e.g., National Synchrotron Light Source X17 wiggler beam has a divergence of 5 mrad). A Kumakhov lens makes it possible to transform a divergent beam into a quasi-parallel one. Parallelism may be obtained on about 0.1θ<sub>cr</sub> where θ<sub>cr</sub> is the critical reflection angle (i.e., we may obtain a divergence of 0.1 mrad on a glass C-52 lens for 30 keV photons. In one example, initial beam losses will be about 30-40%.</p>
    <p>The suggested optics can effectively focus synchrotron radiation beams into a very small spot, eventually less than 1 micron will be possible. The intensity in such a small spot may be increased by greater than 10<sup>4</sup>.</p>
    <p>Capillary optics allow turning of high energy photons through large angles. FIG. 18 shows the dependence of transmission coefficients for photons turning 90° for different materials and for a range of energies. It can be seen that 10-30 keV photons may be turned with only a 30% intensity loss. Such a high efficiency is connected with the high reflectivity of the capillaries' inner surface.</p>
    <p>Synchrotron beams have a small cross section and low divergence. Typically a beam might start out at about 0.5 mm×0.5 mrad and even less. This makes it possible to obtain wide beams with an exceptionally small divergence using Kumakhov lenses (e.g., if we need to transform a synchrotron radiation beam into a parallel beam with the size L, using the Louiville theorem we may in principle obtain divergence θ, established from the formula 1<sub>o</sub> θ<sub>o</sub> =Lθ. If 1<sub>o</sub> θ<sub>o</sub> =0.25 mm×mrad and L≈10 cm, θ=2.5×10<sup>-6</sup> rad.</p>
    <p>In order to obtain supercollimated synchrotron beams, the ends of the channels have to be tapered out, getting wider.</p>
    <p>Filtering out high energy photons or high energy particles is extremely difficult using conventional equipment and is a common problem for many applications and a wide variety of source types. For parallel beams such as synchrotrons a monochromatic beam can be obtained by using a crystal-monochromator. However, higher energy harmonics appear which are extremely difficult to remove.</p>
    <p>One of the useful features of the Kumakhov lens is its ability to transmit a broad band of photon and particle energies. On the other hand, the energies transmitted can be controlled and this control can be used for a variety of applications. The control can result from selective absorption by choice of the lens materials, and selective transmission by selection of the lens design parameters. Although control is possible for photons and particles such as neutrons, the examples discussed will be for X-rays.</p>
    <p>Control of the spacing of the lens elements (for lenses made from capillaries of circular cross section this will be the capillary inside diameter) and the curvature of lens elements also provide control of the transmission band width. In general, small spacing and large curvature increases the transmission of high energy photons, and large spacing and small radius of curvature enhances the transmission of low energy photons. In general, the transmission is optimized when the dimensionless parameter ##EQU1## where R is the radius of curvature of the lens element, θ<sub>cr</sub> is the critical angle of total external reflection and D is the channel width of the individual capillary for a capillary based lens. The effective transmission band width can be as small as a few Kev by choice of the materials and parameters, but is usually greater than about +10-20 keV. Selection of the energy band width to eliminate background due to low energy photon electron multiple scattering or Compton scattering o thermal diffuse scattering of high energy photons can be advantageous for many applications.</p>
    <p>By selecting the material making up the interior surface of the lens elements the photon energies transmitted can be controlled. For example, a copper coating will transmit photons from about 0.6 to about 1 keV and about 6-10 keV. In general, low energy photons are selectively absorbed although a coating with beryllium will give efficient transmission down to photon energies as low as 100 eV.</p>
    <p>Glass capillaries possess a very good inner surface and their reflection coefficient is very high at angles ≦θ<sub>cr</sub>. (e.g., at E=30 keV (θ<sub>cr</sub> =1.11×10<sup>-3</sup> rad) the single reflection coefficient R<sub>1</sub> =0.995 if θ<sub>incid</sub> =10<sup>-3</sup> rad, which is noticeably higher than the reflection coefficient of polished surfaces. At the same time at θ≧θ<sub>cr</sub>, the reflection coefficient sharply decreases (e.g., at θ<sub>incid</sub> =1.1×10<sup>-3</sup>, R<sub>1</sub> =0.987, and at θ<sub>incid</sub> =1.2×10<sup>-3</sup>, R<sub>1</sub> 1 has already decreased to 0.2. That means a 10% change in the incidence angle leads to a nearly 5 times decrease in the reflection coefficient).</p>
    <p>This phenomenon of sharp reduction of R<sub>1</sub> near θ<sub>cr</sub> may be very effectively used for filtering if photons make several reflections. But in order to be able to filter selectively using this technique the beam must have a very small divergence. This very condition characterizes synchrotron radiation (e.g., vertical beam divergence in the NSLS is near 10<sup>-4</sup> rad).</p>
    <p>Table 1 lists calculated high energy filtering for E=30 and 33 keV.</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular">              TABLE 1______________________________________N = number of reflections; R<sup>N</sup> = reflection coefficientγ = ratio R<sup>N</sup> (30 keV)/R<sup>N</sup> (33 keV)N          1         5         10______________________________________R<sup>N</sup> (30 keV)      0.984     0.92      0.85R<sup>N</sup> (33 keV)      0.3       2.7 × 10<sup>-3</sup>                          5.0 × 10<sup>-6</sup>γ    3.28      383       1.44 × 10<sup>5</sup>______________________________________</pre>
    
    <p>As it is clear from the table, after 10 reflections the intensity of 33 keV photons is reduced by over 5 orders of magnitude compared to 30 keV photons. the intensity of 30 keV photons stays practically the same.</p>
    <p>It was suggested before calculating this example that the beam enters a straight capillary at an angle of 1.1×10<sup>-3</sup> rad.</p>
    <p>This method can be used up to very high energies including the γ range.</p>
    <p>By providing the capillary a special geometry (FIG. 19), near the capillary's inflection point, photons travel from one wall to the other. In order for them to stay in the channel, the entrance angle in relation to this new surface has to be smaller than the critical angle. As high energy photons have small reflection angles, they leave the capillary.</p>
    <p>FIG. 20 shows experimental results for a divergent beam from a point source. The transmission of photons with E=40 keV decreases by an order as compared to photons with E=33 keV, and the transmission of 50 keV photons is reduced down to 10<sup>-4</sup>.</p>
    <p>By changing the capillary's radius of curvature, the filtering border is changed. Decreasing the radii decreases the filtering energy, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>The result shown in FIG. 20 is that for the first experiments. By specially shaping the capillary, the sharpness of energy filtering can be increased.</p>
    <p>A capture with capillaries at an angle to the beam makes it possible to effectively cut the beam over a very narrow energy range, obtaining two separate beams, one including the energies higher than the selected energy and the other beam including the energies lower than the selected energy. This is possible because many of those photons which strike a surface at an angle larger than the Fresnel angle simply pass through the material. At higher energies only a small percent of the photons are absorbed.</p>
    <p>To use this design, the beam must have low divergence. Best results are obtained from using a rectangular capillary or system of rectangular capillaries or flat surfaces. Referring to FIG. 21A, if the initial parallel beam, I<sub>0</sub> m strikes a surface or capillary opening at an angle θ<sub>0</sub>, those photons with a θ<sub>critical</sub> &gt;θ<sub>0</sub> are reflected, and those photons with a higher energy and therefore their θ<sub>critical</sub> &lt;θ<sub>0</sub> pass through. Therefore, two beams are obtained I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>, with spectral distribution as shown in FIG. 21B.</p>
    <p>By using the above technique more than once it is possible to tailor a narrow band width. For example, if beam I<sub>2</sub> from FIG. 21A encounters another capillary, flat surface, or capillary system at an angle of incidence, θ<sub>1</sub>, slightly less than that of the first surfaces encountered, θ<sub>0</sub>, then those photons with θ<sub>1</sub> &lt;θ<sub>critical</sub> &lt;θ<sub>0</sub> will be reflected as beam I<sub>3</sub>. I<sub>3</sub> 's spectral distribution is shown in FIG. 21B. Similarly, multiple band widths can be selected by continuing the process, e.g. resulting in beam I<sub>5</sub> in FIG. 21B. Out of a synchrotron beam it is possible to achieve quasi-monochromatic beams which have a beam width with a ratio of energy width/energy of a few 10<sup>-2</sup> with only a 50% loss in beam intensity in the energies represented. By using such a tailored band width it is possible to obtain a much higher flux quasi-monochromatic beam than would be in the monochromatic beam obtained from a crystal monochromator. And multiple narrow band width beams can be obtained at desired energies.</p>
    <p>Frequently, the photon intensity is so large that absorption of even a small fraction of incident photons will result in heating to temperatures of hundreds of degrees--sometimes exceeding the melting point of metals and frequently producing large thermal gradients with accompanying mechanical stress and deformation. This effect is particularly serious from absorption in isolating windows, diffracting crystals or deflecting mirrors. To accommodate the large photon flux intensity at the input of a Kumakhov lens, a number of design features can by included.</p>
    <p>FIG. 25 shows that input baffling baffles may be hollow and cooled with flowing fluid (liquid or gas), or may be solid and cooled by coils on the surface or at the periphery.</p>
    <p>By stopping the radiation that would otherwise strike and be stopped by the ends of the lens elements, the lens is kept from heating. The radiation entering the lens elements strike the wall of the lens at different distances from the entrance because of the gentle curvature (less than the critical angle for the total external reflection of the highest energy photons transmitted) and therefore are distributed over a very much larger area than oblique incidence.</p>
    <p>The lens itself may be fabricated from high melt temperature glass, ceramic or metal materials. For example, fabrication from pure SiO<sub>2</sub> (quartz) will allow temperatures as high as 2000° C. before distortion in melting will interfere with photon transmission. The lens elements may also be coated with high melting thermally conducting elemental or compound materials such as tungsten, silicon carbide, carbon, etc.</p>
    <p>The lens elements may also be cooled by:</p>
    <p>i: surrounding them with solid material of high thermal conductivity which is then cooled by openings in the bulk or the periphery through which liquid gas is passed, or which have specially attached cooling fins of high cross-sectional area; or</p>
    <p>ii: passing a fluid (liquid or gas) coolant between the lens elements. It is possible to do this even though the lens is operated in a vacuum since the walls of the lens elements serve as a vacuum barrier (see, FIG. 26);</p>
    <p>iii: passing a cooling gas through the lens. This can be done when high energy photons are being transmitted if a cooling gas is chosen such as helium which has high thermal conductivity and low absorption cross section for the transmitted photons.</p>
    <p>An important use of a Kumakhov lens is to control the direction and cross-section of a radiation beam. Beam cross-sections can be reshaped to achieve desired cross-sections by designing the surfaces. For example, if capillaries are used it is clearly possible to capture a thin rectangular beam such as might come from a synchrotron and by so orienting the capillaries or capillary bundles (polycapillaries) (see, for example, FIG. 27), emit a square or circular beam. This can be particularly advantageous on the synchrotron if an area with a vertical dimension larger than the vertical dimension of the original beam must be irradiated. A synchrotron beam has been broadened from 1 mm to a quasi-parallel beam of 6 cm with only a 50% loss of intensity.</p>
    <p>The input shape of the transmitting lens can be configured to accommodate the shape of the beam such as the photon beam emerging from the synchrotron. For the synchrotron this shape will in general be asymmetric because of the tangential emission from the particle storage ring and the fan shape of the radiation field, but it can be any arbitrary shape to accommodate the beam coming from the source.</p>
    <p>It is even possible to deflect the beam through angles of 90° or larger in order to, for example, irradiate vertical targets instead of having to irradiate horizontal targets.</p>
    <p>As it is possible to turn beams, it is also possible to split beams and separate the beams. This has been experimentally demonstrated.</p>
    <p>Because in certain embodiments of the Kumakhov lens, some of the portions of the beam are turned through larger angles than others or are turned on smaller radii than other sections of the beam, these portions of the beam may have higher losses. Methods for controlling intensity across the beam cross-section (usually to obtain uniform intensity) already discussed include variable filtering and selectively extending the lengths of some channels to increase losses in that portion of the beam. The drawbacks to both of these methods is that control of intensity is obtained by increasing losses, i.e., decreasing photon intensity thereby decreasing the efficiency of the lens. A method of controlling intensity across the beam which does not suffer from this drawback is modifying the spacing between channels, so the spacing is larger where intensity should be decreased and smaller where intensity should be increased. In this way photons are redistributed rather than filtered out. The drawback of this method is that microhomogeneity is decreased.</p>
    <p>Many types of sources are subject to spatial instability, including synchrotron beams which are subject to certain fluctuations. A Kumakhov lens can capture radiation from an area which may exceed the size of the source. Therefore, small shifts of the source's location do not practically affect the intensity, parallelism, and uniformity of the photon beam which comes from the Kumakhov lens. This makes it possible to stabilize the source's spatial location.</p>
    <p>In order to obtain small divergence it is possible to use barrel-shaped capillaries with their size diminishing towards their entrance end. (FIG. 22). In this case if the source's size is small enough and the channel's curvature radius is great enough we may obtain at the exit a divergence much smaller than the critical reflection angle.</p>
    <p>To obtain a small focal spot we may converge this lens (FIG. 23).</p>
    <p>To obtain high intensity radiation from a divergent source we may use the geometry shown in FIG. 24. A half-barrel is located after the source, it transforms divergent radiation into a quasi-parallel beam, then there is a cone-shaped capillary. If the divergence after the half-barrel equals θ<sub>1</sub>, the ratio between the larger end diameter d<sub>1</sub> to the smaller one d<sub>2</sub> may be of the order of: ##EQU2## where θ<sub>cr</sub> is the complete external reflection (CER) angle. The minimum dimension of d<sub>1</sub> for X-ray photons is limited by diffraction and is˜c/wp (c is light speed, wp is plasmal frequency), i.e. about 100 Å. For ions, this dimension may be brought down to atomic sizes.</p>
    <p>Channel cross-sections need not be circular. For example, channels for tailoring narrow energy width beams often have a flat side and may be rectangular. Capillaries, capillary bundles, and individual channels in polycapillaries are often not circular as other shapes such as hexagonal, rectangular, and triangular can provide more efficient packing leading to higher open area in the lens cross section and to higher strength.</p>
    <p>Lenses for controlling ions are most effective if the material the channels are formed from or a coating of the channels is electrically conducting so that an electrostatic space charge will not be built up which will electrically repel the ions. And surface finishes are especially critical.</p>
    <p>For controlling neutrons, the surface of the channels should be selected so there are no materials which have a high absorption cross-section for neutrons. For example, glass capillaries containing boron have an extremely low efficiency for neutrons.</p>
    <p>Kumakhov lenses can be designed to serve many functions simultaneously. For example, a single lens might capture divergent radiation and form a quasi-parallel beam as well as selectively filter the photon energies, and compensate for higher losses in the outer channels.</p>
    <p>The invention described hereinabove is mainly an illustration of the principle of controlling gamma and X-ray radiation and particles, and is, therefore, accompanied by a description of specific embodiments thereof. It will be apparent to those skilled in this art, that various modifications, substitutions, additions and the like can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined by the claims which follow and their equivalents.</p>
