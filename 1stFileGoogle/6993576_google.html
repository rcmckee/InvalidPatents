<p num="p-0002">The present invention generally relates to a system and a method for managing maintenance of building facilities. More particularly, the invention relates to a system and a method for managing maintenance of building facilities using data transfer between a server computer and a plurality of client computers, each having a unique login identity.</p>
  <p num="p-0003">The management of maintenance in building facilities typically involves several processes that often have not been effectively defined or integrated with one another in the past. To effectively carry out such management processes, there must be a process for inspecting the building facilities to determine what tasks have been done and what tasks need to be done, and these tasks can change according to various schedules. To have an efficient overall system, other effective processes must be provided, including a work request process, a work order process, a schedule tracking process, and a notification process. In most known conventional systems, most of these processes have been done manually in that they have been at least partially done with the use of considerable human intervention, which is inefficient, costly and time consuming. In addition, massive human intervention in a complex system tends to cause more errors. For example, a customer's inspection orders, work requests, and work orders have often been lost or not processed, which often results in considerable customer dissatisfaction.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">There are computer-implemented systems that attempt to reduce the use of human intervention at various steps of such complicated building facilities management maintenance. However, these systems do not fully integrate the whole maintenance system. Most of them simply allow customers to communicate with vendors over the web, and do not provide an integrated system that minimizes the need for unnecessary human intervention. Such systems often are unable to offer customization of each building facility that can result in greater precision and organization in the maintenance management system.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved system and method for automatically and efficiently managing maintenance of building facilities with minimal human intervention.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Another object of the present invention is to provide such an improved system and method that permits robust customization that can be tailored to each building facility.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Still another object of the present invention is to provide such an improved system and method that permits simple and quick communications between the customer and the vendor.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such an improved system and method that can use mobile computing devices that can configured to display selective data for each assigned job site.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">A further object of the present invention is to provide such an improved system and method that can operate on a worldwide scale using a large-scale network, such as the Internet.</p>
  <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0010">The present invention is directed to a method and a system for managing maintenance of a building facility using data transfer between one or more server computers and one or more client computers. The system and method allows full integration of the maintenance management process using a computer-implemented system to minimize human intervention and increase system efficiency and accuracy, while reducing operating costs.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">More particularly, the system and method are adapted to utilize one or more client computers connected via a large-scale network such as the Internet to a server with a central database. Such client computers can be personal computers, other computers, or mobile computing devices, such as PDA's as well as cell phone devices. Any of these devices will hereinafter be referred to simply as a client. From the central database, job sites are tracked and monitored for fulfillment of inspections, work requests, work orders, or any other scheduled items. In addition, the present invention can automatically send out requests or events responsive to data stored in the central database without human intervention. As a result, the system is adapted to customize each job site and maintain precision and organization with minimized human intervention.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">In accordance with an important aspect of the present invention, the system includes one or more server adapted to receive events from a client and forward the events to a clearinghouse via a communication link, one or more client having a unique login identity and adapted to selectively send events to the server via the communication link, and a clearinghouse connected to each server and each client via the communication link for selectively storing data from each server and each client in a database. The clearinghouse is further adapted to selectively authorize predetermined events by each client according to the login identity of each such client, to selectively schedule predetermined events in response to data stored in the database and to monitor the status of all events stored in the database.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0040">Broadly stated, the present invention is directed to a system and a method for managing operational facilities; the system or method being of the type that utilizes predefined events to carry out managing operations for the facilities. The system includes at least one server adapted to receive events from a client and forward the events to a clearinghouse via a communication link. In addition, the system includes at least one client, but preferably hundreds if not thousands of clients, each of which having a unique login identity, adapted to selectively send events to the server via the communication link. Also included in the system is a clearinghouse connected to each server and each client via the communication link for selectively storing data from each server and each client in a database. The clearinghouse is further adapted to selectively authorize predetermined events by each client according to the login identity of each such client, to selectively schedule predetermined events in response to data stored in the database and to monitor the status of all events stored in the database.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">It is contemplated that the present invention can be implemented for various operational managing systems, such as janitorial, electrical, plumbing, drywall, lawn care, plant care, waste removal, parking lots, and roofing. In addition, other operational managing systems are also contemplated. For example, a heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system or a window cleaning, installation, and repair system can also be implemented with the present invention. Other examples include energy management, carpentry and general repair, pool maintenance, boilers and furnaces maintenance, lighting and signage maintenance, and tree trimming. Although the previous examples focus mainly on the facility operational maintenance, the present invention contemplates other managing systems dealing with different entities, such as property management, security guards, tenants of commercial office buildings, elevator services, fire protection services, equipment maintenance, appliance repair, furniture repair, road repair, trucking services, and locks and access control systems. It is further anticipated that the present invention can be implemented with all kinds of inspection systems for safety, water and soil sampling, aviation, boat, ship, plumbing code, electrical code, and surveyors.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Another implementation relates to the medical services. For example, the present invention can manage home use medical equipment and home nursing care. In addition, customer and vendor related services, such as a bidding service, can also be included within the present invention. For example, the bidding service provides a gateway for a customer to propose bids to many vendors in a single transaction, which benefits both the customers and vendors. As a result, the customers are connected to the vendors more efficiently, reducing the overall management time for transactions.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">The present invention can add another dimension in facility management with an employee tracker system, for example. Employees can carry a mobile computing device (“MCD”) with customized data for completing a specific task, while the MCD incorporates a Global Positioning System (“GPS”) for tracking the employee. The coordinates registered from the GPS can be integrated into the different events almost at any time in the process depending on the type of event involved. For example, the coordinates can be logged whenever the user answers a question proposed during an event or upon completion of an event. Another alternative is logging the coordinates once during the opening of the event and another time when the same event is closed. The logged coordinates can either be sent to the server as data for storage in the database or be included in the events that are created in response to the processing of the previous event.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">The GPS can ensure that the employees having MCD's were actually at the site at a specific time to complete a particular task. Another example is implementing the present invention in a trucking business for dispatching and tracking the use of the trucks and trailers. The implementation can change with the customer's demands or the needs for special customization. For example, the present invention requires different customization if the customer is an insurance adjuster. Other examples include property appraisers, case workers, probation officers, and telecommunication and cable installers, which all require different customizations. Basically, the present invention can be implemented for any system with complex management interrelations with various components in the system. As a result, there are many ways to implement the present invention, and these other alternatives or modifications are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system in which the present method can be implemented is generally indicated as part of a preferably wide area network <b>10</b>. A plurality of client computers (“clients”) <b>12</b> is connected to a plurality of network servers (“server”) <b>14</b> via the network <b>10</b>. As an example, the clients <b>12</b> can be network servers, which in turn are connected to workstations <b>16</b> within an intranet. In addition, the present invention can be implemented using a variety of connections, such as the Internet or wireless communication system. The connection functions primarily to allow the server and the client to communicate and transfer data preferably but not necessarily using real time communication.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">However, the Internet is the preferable network connection <b>8</b> because it provides the most flexible and universal way of communicating. If the Internet is used as the communication connection between the client <b>12</b> and the server <b>14</b>, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is the preferred language for its implementation. However, the present invention can be implemented practically in any number of ways that may evolve with evolving technology. To further the complexity of the various network types that may be available, issues of bandwidth, reliability and security of the network are important considerations. As a result, an explanation of the current preferred embodiment of the network topology is given as an example and other networks and connections are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">A schematic diagram of the components implemented in the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and includes a clearinghouse <b>18</b> linked to a database <b>20</b>. The database <b>20</b> acts as a central storage location for the data <b>22</b> for each building facility. The clearinghouse <b>18</b> is, among other things, the management system for the present invention. The clearinghouse is directly linked to the database <b>20</b> for inputting and extracting data <b>22</b> from the database for further communication with one of the servers <b>14</b>, which is also connected to one or more clients <b>12</b>. The server <b>14</b> is, among other things, a gateway for the client <b>12</b> to communicate with the clearinghouse <b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Although the data involved is generally a text file or database file containing textual and numerical information, the present invention contemplates the use of other data formats for use with graphic, audio and video files. Presently, the current available bandwidth speed makes it difficult, if not impracticable to send photographs or video over the transmission. However, as bandwidth increases and technology improves, the implementation of these types of data is very feasible. For example, an inspector can send an image of an area that needs to be further attended by a staff member. Rather than using only textual language, a description with the use of visual data makes communications between parties more clear and efficient. The present invention, therefore, contemplates the use of visual and audio data in addition to purely textual data as an implementation within the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">Both the clearinghouse <b>18</b> and the client <b>12</b> can create events <b>24</b> that trigger certain predefined actions from any of the components depending on the type of the event. In addition, data <b>22</b> can be transferred between the clearinghouse <b>18</b> and client <b>12</b>, and the clearinghouse in turn saves or retrieves the data from the database <b>20</b>. Although these components are shown as a separate unit, they can be placed in a single unit. For example, for a smaller scale implementation, it may be preferable for the server <b>14</b> to contain both the clearinghouse <b>18</b> and database <b>20</b>. In contrast, it may be preferred that all the components remain in separate computers for a larger scale implementation. The arrangements of these components can vary and are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">A flow chart of the overall general scheme of the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for an overall system that has events that generally interact with each other. The events of work-request <b>26</b>, job site-setup <b>28</b>, inspection-setup <b>30</b>, scheduling <b>32</b>, notification <b>34</b>, and monitoring <b>36</b> are all integrated and can interact with one another within the system. In addition, the client <b>12</b>, which generally represents a vendor which may supply goods and/or services or a customer of the entity which operates the system, can initiate these events, which in turn can trigger other events, such as a work-order <b>38</b> and inspections-processing <b>40</b>. The client <b>12</b> itself can also trigger some of the events, specifically a work-request <b>26</b>, a job site-setup <b>28</b>, an inspection-setup <b>30</b>, a notification-<b>34</b>, a work-order <b>48</b>, and an inspection-processing event <b>40</b>. Also, the clearinghouse <b>18</b> can initiate any of the events.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">The interaction among these events is generally maintained by the clearinghouse <b>18</b>. For example, the work-request event <b>26</b> can initiate the work-order event <b>38</b> and vice versa. The inspection-processing event <b>40</b> interacts with both the inspection-setup event <b>30</b> and the notification event <b>34</b> at a certain point in the process. A more detailed explanation of how certain events relate and react to one another will follow below in order to provide a clear understanding of how the system works as a whole.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">As previously mentioned, the client <b>12</b> can be a mobile computing device, and a customer or a vendor can login on the system using the client. In the case of a vendor using a client for processing a subroutine, such as inspection processing <b>42</b>, the client <b>12</b> is preferably a mobile computing device. The client <b>12</b> also is preferably preloaded with certain data according to the assigned job sites of the user of the device. Since the login of these mobile computing devices is different from a client that is a personal computer, specific processes are provided for the devices, which are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">Although a process for the MCD with preloaded data and software is provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the present invention contemplates using portable devices with wireless Internet access, such as a Personal Digital Assistant or Pocket PC. The MCD, in this case, responds or sends events preferably by connecting to the web page directly on the MCD. As a result, there is no need to preload the MCD with software or data. The needed data will be displayed through the web page. In this instance, the MCD does not need the process described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This alternative implementation is within the scope of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">The flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a preferred mobile computing device (“MCD”) session, which is triggered by the device user (block <b>42</b>). The process begins (block <b>44</b>) by the user starting a client using software that was previously installed and specifically designed for the MCD <b>12</b>, which will be referred to as the task list program (“TLP”) (block <b>46</b>). The MCD <b>12</b> next enters a username and a password to sign onto the server <b>14</b> (block <b>48</b>), and checks whether the login was successful (block <b>50</b>). If the login was unsuccessful, the MCD <b>12</b> displays an error message from the server <b>14</b> explaining why the login failed (block <b>52</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0055">If, on the other hand, the login was successful (block <b>50</b>), the MCD <b>12</b> will establish a connection with the server and start communicating with the server for downloading of the task list (block <b>54</b>). The MCD <b>12</b> then downloads the task list in an in-box designed for the login identity of the user from the server (block <b>56</b>), which initiates a download-tasks event (block <b>58</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and will be explained in greater detail below. After the download-tasks event has been processed (block <b>58</b>), the MCD next uploads completed tasks in its out-box for this user (block <b>60</b>), which initiates the upload-tasks event (block <b>62</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and will again be explained later in great detail.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Because a successful login gives the MCD a specific user identity matching stored information in the database, the user of the MCD still has a choice to download tasks, upload tasks, perform a task, or exit the TLP (block <b>64</b>) with or without a specific user identity. If the user wants to download tasks from the server (block <b>64</b>), the download-tasks event is initiated (block <b>66</b>). Similarly, the upload-tasks event is initiated (block <b>62</b>) if the user chooses to upload tasks to the server (block <b>68</b>). If the user chooses to perform a specific task on the MCD (block <b>64</b>), a perform-task event is initiated (block <b>70</b>) which is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and will be described in detail. Finally, the user can also exit the process (block <b>72</b>) by choosing to exit the TLP (block <b>64</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0057">A flow chart of the download-tasks event <b>66</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and is initiated by the MCD (block <b>74</b>), and the process begins (block <b>76</b>) with the MCD checking the connection with the server (block <b>78</b>). If the MCD is not connected, the user has to login using a username and password (block <b>80</b>). Then, it is checked again if the login was successful (block <b>82</b>). If not, the MCD displays an error message from the server (block <b>52</b>) and brings the user back to the choices of downloading tasks, uploading tasks, perform a task, or exit TLP (block <b>64</b>). Otherwise, once the connection with the server is established (blocks <b>78</b>, <b>82</b>), the next step is to move a task pointer to the beginning of the new task list (block <b>84</b>). The MCD <b>12</b> downloads the first task in the task list from the in-box for this user (block <b>86</b>) and determines whether the downloaded task list data is valid (block <b>88</b>). If the data are valid (block <b>88</b>), the MCD determines whether that is the end of the task list (block <b>90</b>). If so, the process ends (block <b>92</b>). Otherwise, it loops back and downloads the next task from the list (block <b>94</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0058">On the other hand, if data is invalid on the task list (block <b>88</b>), the MCD is prompted to determine whether the connection with the server is still valid (block <b>96</b>). The MCD will make an entry in the exception log (block <b>98</b>) if the connection is no longer valid (block <b>96</b>), and the process ends (block <b>92</b>). Otherwise, when the connection is still valid (block <b>96</b>), the MCD increments a retry count (block <b>100</b>) and determines whether the incremented retry count has reached its predefined maximum number of retries (block <b>102</b>). Again, if maximum number of retries has been reached (block <b>102</b>), an entry in the exception log will be made (block <b>98</b>) and the process ends (block <b>92</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0059">A flow chart for the upload-tasks event <b>68</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and is triggered by the TLP (block <b>106</b>) and starts the process (block <b>108</b>). It is first determined whether the MCD is connected to the server (block <b>110</b>). If not, the user must enter a username and a password to establish a connection with the server (block <b>112</b>). However, if the login is unsuccessful (block <b>114</b>), the process loops back to display an error message from the server to the user (block <b>52</b>), after which the user is given the option to choose whether to download tasks, upload tasks, perform a task, or exit TLP (block <b>64</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0060">If the login is successful (block <b>114</b>), similar to the download-tasks event <b>72</b>, the task pointer moves to the beginning of the completed task list (block <b>118</b>) to ensure that the first completed task is uploaded. The MCD <b>12</b> uploads the first task in the list from the out-box for this user (block <b>118</b>), and determines whether the upload is successful (block <b>120</b>). The MCD <b>12</b> determines whether this is the end of the task list (block <b>122</b>) and if the upload was successful (block <b>120</b>). If so, the process ends (block <b>124</b>). Otherwise, it loops back and downloads the next task from the list (block <b>126</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0061">On the other hand, if the upload proves to be unsuccessful (block <b>120</b>), the MCD is prompted to verify that the connection with the server is still valid (block <b>128</b>). The MCD will make an entry in the exception log (block <b>130</b>) if the connection is not valid (block <b>130</b>), and the process ends (block <b>124</b>). Otherwise, when the connection is still valid (block <b>128</b>), the MCD increments a retry count (block <b>132</b>) and determines whether the incremented retry count has reached its predefined maximum number of retries (block <b>134</b>). Again, if maximum number of retires has been reached (block <b>134</b>), an entry in the exception log will be made (block <b>130</b>) and the process ends (block <b>124</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0062">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which illustrates a flow chart of the perform-task event <b>70</b>, the user first selects a task from the task list stored in the MCD (block <b>138</b>) and elects to perform the selected task (block <b>140</b>). Then, the MCD opens an associated task execution program (“TEP”), which runs the MCD from this point (block <b>142</b>). The TEP is generally a program displaying a specific template or form that is designated to the selected task with its customization. For example, if the selected task is for a specific job site having predefined custom checklist items for an inspection, then the TEP displays the form with the predefined checklist items for the user to complete the inspection as requested by the job site. This allows for customization and provides simpler ways to accomplish a specific task, because the MCD can display the correct forms that match the selected task to the user. In this example, the user is shown a series of screens necessary to accomplish the selected task (block <b>144</b>). However, at any given point during this process, the user can choose to complete the task or stop and return to the TLP (block <b>146</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0063">The TEP displays the first checklist item of the selected task for a response from the user (block <b>148</b>). The user can then choose to respond, stop or skip this particular checklist item (block <b>150</b>). If the user chooses to stop the TEP (block <b>152</b>), the TEP ends and passes control back to the TLP (block <b>154</b>). On the other hand, if the user does not choose to stop the TEP (block <b>152</b>), the user must choose to either skip or respond to the checklist item. The TEP stores the response for this checklist item if the user responds to the checklist item (block <b>155</b>) and proceeds to the next checklist item once that is done (block <b>156</b>). However, the next checklist item is still displayed (block <b>156</b>) even if the user chooses to skip this checklist item. It is then determined whether the selected task is completed (block <b>158</b>). In other words, the routine determines whether the user has completed all of the checklist items. If the task is completed, the TEP ends itself and passes control of the MCD back to the TLP. Otherwise, the process loops back for the next checklist item for the user to choose one of the available options (block <b>150</b>) and continues until the task is completed.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">Four exemplary display screens on the mobile computing device are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref> <i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>). As an example, assume that the previous selected task is an inspection of a specific job site, the TEP displays a first screen showing the name of the inspector, the name of the building, the address of the building, the location of the building for inspection, date, and the inspection type (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref> <i>a</i>)). The user can change any of these fields at this point. In addition, from this first screen, the user can choose to start the inspection or exit the TEP. If the user chooses to start the inspection, the next screen is preferably a weekly inspection form shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref> <i>b</i>), since the first screen displayed a weekly inspection type. The user can select any of the items listed on the screen. The next screen shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref> <i>c</i>) is a display of the “signage, prices, labels correct” item in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref> <i>b</i>). Finally, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref> <i>d</i>) shows an example message screen for sending an email using the MCD. Many other screens are available and the arrangement of these screens can be changed and are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">An overall scheme of a session initiated by a user of the client <b>12</b> not using a MCD with preloaded software for connection with the server <b>14</b> through, for example, the Internet is illustrated in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As previously mentioned, the client can be a personal computer or a MCD. Both the personal computer and the MCD connect with the server <b>14</b> via the Internet in a web browser environment. In this preferred embodiment, the MCD is not preloaded with anything. Rather, the MCD has a general wireless Internet connection with a web browser capability. From that, it is able to respond or send events by visiting various web pages that are available on the web site. In fact, it is preferred that all setup processes, such as a jobsite-setup event, be done in the web browser environment.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">As an example, the process is triggered by the client opening the home page provided for the implementation of the present invention (block <b>160</b>). Although the preferred connection is through a web page setting, it is not necessary. For example, the present invention can be implemented using other connections, such as a private network. These alternative connections are within the scope of the present invention. However, a XML web page environment is preferred because it can presently provide the most flexible and simplest environment for the implementation of the present invention. Regardless, the preferred environment can change with technology, and other possible alternatives are also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">The session begins (block <b>162</b>) with the user first providing a username and a password in order to log into the server and becomes an authorized client (block <b>164</b>). The server next determines whether this is a valid user (block <b>166</b>). If not, the server makes an entry in the security log (block <b>168</b>) and the process ends (block <b>170</b>). The user can then choose an option from the menu (block <b>172</b>). The options include initiating a job site-setup event <b>28</b>, an inspection-templates-setup event <b>174</b>, work request event <b>26</b>, work order event <b>38</b>, schedules-setup event <b>32</b>, and contacts-setup event <b>176</b>. Once the selected option has been processed, the session checks if the authorized client wants to continue with choosing the options in the menu (block <b>178</b>). If so, it loops back to the option menu (block <b>172</b>). Otherwise, the session ends (block <b>170</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0068">A more detailed description of the jobsite-setup event <b>28</b> previously described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 9</figref> is shown in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. This event is generally initiated by the user of the client <b>12</b> (block <b>180</b>). The process begins (block <b>182</b>) by giving the user of the client a choice of adding new data, editing existing data, or exiting from the event (block <b>184</b>). If exiting the job site-setup event is selected, the process ends at that point (block <b>186</b>). The server displays the existing data to the client for revision for the choice of editing existing data, and the process continues on to the next step when the option of adding new data is selected (block <b>188</b>). The user generally first adds or revises the job attributes, the name and address of the building facility or other information that helps identify the building (block <b>190</b>). The user next adds or revises the identification of the various parts, sections, or areas of the job site (block <b>192</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0069">Next, the user sets up the contacts for the job site (block <b>194</b>), which will initiate the contact-setup event shown in greater detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Then, the user sets up the vendors for the job site (block <b>196</b>) initiating the vendor-setup, which is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. After that is done, the user has to set up the inspections initiating the inspection-setup event (block <b>200</b>) and special actions initiating the special-actions-setup event (block <b>204</b>). For each inspection that is setup, the user defines a schedule for the inspection (block <b>208</b>), which is followed by defining defaults for any information needed for the job site (block <b>210</b>). The server <b>14</b> saves all the information onto the database (block <b>212</b>). It is next determined whether the user wants to continue setting up another job site (block <b>214</b>). If so, the process loops back to the option menu (block <b>184</b>). Otherwise, the process ends (block <b>186</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0070">The contact-setup event <b>194</b> is shown in more detail in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and is generally initiated by the user of the client (block <b>216</b>). However, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it can also follow from another event. The process begins (block <b>218</b>) initially by giving the user an option menu for adding new data, editing existing data, or exiting the contact-setup event (block <b>220</b>). If exiting the contact-setup event is selected, the process will end (block <b>222</b>). Otherwise, the server displays the existing data to the client for revision (block <b>224</b>) when editing existing data is selected, and the process continues on to the next step when adding new data is selected. The user generally first adds or revises the contact attributes, the name and address of the contact, or other information that helps identify the contact (block <b>226</b>). Next, the user defines the method of communications with the contact (block <b>228</b>), which follows with the contact's preferences and communication method for various events (block <b>230</b>). The user also defines the communication backup preference in cases when the contact is not accessible (block <b>232</b>). The type of client used by the user is also defined within the contact data (block <b>234</b>). The server then saves the contact data in the database (block <b>236</b>) and determines whether the user wants to continue with the contact-setup event (block <b>238</b>). If so, the process goes back to the option menu (block <b>220</b>). Otherwise, the process simply ends (block <b>222</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0071">Referring again to the vendor-setup event <b>196</b>, it is shown in more detail in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The vendor-setup event <b>196</b> is generally initiated by the user of the client (block <b>240</b>), but as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it can also follow from another event. The process starts (block <b>242</b>) with the server displaying a job vendor association screen to the client (block <b>244</b>), in which the user has a choice to add new data, edit existing data, or exit the vendor-setup event (block <b>246</b>). If exiting the vendor-setup event is selected, the process will end (block <b>248</b>). Otherwise, the server allows the client to add a new vendor in the vendor master list stored on the database (block <b>250</b>). Alternatively, if the user wants to only edit existing data, the process moves to the next step. At which time, the user defines the vendors and the service type for each job site (block <b>252</b>). In addition, if applicable, information of sharing permissions for the vendor can also be added or revised in this step. After the user finished revising the vendor data, it is then saved onto the database (block <b>254</b>). It is then determined whether the user wants to continue in the vendor-setup event (block <b>256</b>). The process will end (block <b>248</b>) if the user does not want to continue in the vendor-setup event, otherwise the process loops back to the option menu (block <b>246</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0072">With regard to the inspection-setup event <b>200</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), it is shown in more detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and is generally initiated by the client (block <b>258</b>). Similarly, the process starts (block <b>260</b>) with an option menu for adding new data, editing existing data, and to exit the inspection-setup event (block <b>262</b>). If exiting the inspection-setup event is selected, the process ends (block <b>264</b>). Otherwise, the server displays the existing data to the client for revision if editing existing data is selected (block <b>266</b>), and the process continues on to the next step when adding new data is selected. The user generally first adds or revises the inspection attributes, description, or other useful information about the inspection (block <b>268</b>). For each area of the job site, the user defines the inspection steps using items from an existing checklist for this job site or from a default inspection template stored on the database (block <b>270</b>). The user next revises the checklist items as needed (block <b>272</b>), and the checklist-item-setup event <b>274</b> is initiated (block <b>276</b>). The checklist-item-setup event <b>274</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, and will be described below in greater detail. The server saves the revised inspection data including inspection records and schedules onto the database (block <b>278</b>), and determines whether the user wants to continue with the inspection-setup event (block <b>280</b>). If so, the process goes back to the option menu (block <b>262</b>). Otherwise, the process ends (block <b>264</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The checklist-item-setup event <b>274</b> previously mentioned in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is shown in more detail in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Although this event follows from the inspection-setup event, the event can be initiated by the client at any point in the whole system (block <b>282</b>). The process starts (block <b>284</b>) similarly with an option menu for adding new data, editing existing data, or exiting the contact-setup event (block <b>286</b>). If the user chooses to exit the checklist-item-setup event, the process ends (block <b>288</b>). If not, the server displays the existing data to the client for revision (block <b>290</b>) if the user chooses to edit. If, however, the user chooses to add data, the process continues to the next step. The user can add or revise the checklist item attributes, description, or other useful information about the checklist item (block <b>292</b>). The user enters or edits questions or statements to the inspector, and the response type will also be setup along with the performance rating method for the checklist item (block <b>294</b>). The user goes on to setup the performance rating method for the checklist items (block <b>296</b>), and the performance-rating-method-setup event <b>298</b> is initiated as a result. The server saves the revised checklist-item data including records and schedules onto the database (block <b>300</b>), and determines whether the user wants to continue with the inspection-setup event (block <b>302</b>). Again, the process ends (block <b>288</b>) if the user does not want to continue. Otherwise, the process loops back to the option menu (block <b>286</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0074">In accordance with an important aspect of the present invention, the user can specify the desired performance rating method from a number of options. This can be done as shown in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, and this event is generally triggered by other events (block <b>304</b>), although it can also be triggered by the client <b>12</b>. The process initially begins (block <b>306</b>) by giving the user an option menu for adding new data, editing existing data, or exiting the contact-setup event (block <b>308</b>). If exiting the contact-setup event is selected, the process will end (block <b>310</b>). Otherwise, the server displays the existing data to the client for revision (block <b>312</b>) if editing existing data is selected, and the process continues on to the next step when adding data is selected. The user then adds or revises the performance rating method attributes and description in addition to any other information that may be useful (block <b>314</b>). Next, the user can add or revise the performance rating type (block <b>316</b>), initiating another event (block <b>316</b>). More specifically, the performance-rating-type-setup event is initiated (block <b>316</b>). Again, the server saves the revised information onto the database (block <b>320</b>), which is followed by a step determining whether the user wants to continue with the current event (block <b>322</b>). If so, the process goes back to the option menu (block <b>308</b>). Otherwise, the process simply ends (block <b>310</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0075">More specifically, with regard to selecting the performance rating type block <b>316</b> and referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, it is triggered by the performance-rating-method-setup event (block <b>324</b>). The process starts with an option menu of three performance rating types (block <b>328</b>), specifically yes/no, multiple options, and numeric scoring. For the yes/no type, there will be only two valid responses (e.g., done/not done) in which the user will specify the valid responses (block <b>330</b>). However, the two valid responses are mutually exclusive, meaning the logic should prevent it from choosing both at the same time. Next, for the multiple options type, any number of options (e.g., good, fair, or poor) are possible (block <b>332</b>), and the user has to specify each available option in this setup. But only one option is allowed as a valid response. Similarly, the logic allows only one option to be chosen. With the numeric type, the user specifies a range of numeric values having a minimum and a maximum along with a step interval (e.g., 1 to 10 with an increment of 0.5) (block <b>334</b>). The process ends (block <b>336</b>) when the user finishes selecting and defining the performance rating type.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">The routine for setting up a special-action event <b>204</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, which is triggered by the job site-setup event <b>28</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> (block <b>338</b>). The process begins (block <b>340</b>) with the user defining a special action for an individual checklist item, a group of checklist items, or a job area (block <b>342</b>). The user can also define special actions for each of the three performance rating types discussed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> (block <b>344</b>). Alternatively, if the special actions are based on a group, the total score for that group can be used as a threshold comparison for the special actions (block <b>344</b>). Next, the user can set up one or more actions for each special action, such as notifying one or more contacts, creating a work request or work order and notifying the contacts (block <b>346</b>). And each special action can also include a response time (block <b>346</b>). The user can also setup the special action to be triggered by the response from the three performance rating type. For the yes/no type of action, it can be triggered by either of the events (block <b>348</b>). Similarly, within the multiple options type, the action can be triggered by the valid response (block <b>350</b>). Finally, for the numeric type, the user can use a range method and define the range that triggers the special actions (block <b>352</b>). With that, the process ends (block <b>354</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0077">To setup the inspection-templates-setup event <b>174</b> as described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the steps of the flow chart shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> are carried out. The event can also be triggered by the user of the client <b>12</b> who chooses this option on the web page (block <b>356</b>). The process starts (block <b>358</b>) with an option menu of adding new data, editing existing data, or exiting from the event (block <b>360</b>). If exiting the job site-setup event is selected, the process ends (block <b>362</b>). Otherwise, either the server displays the existing data to the client for revision if the edit option is chosen (block <b>364</b>), or the process continues on to the next step if the add option is chosen. The user then adds or revises the template attributes and description, or other information that may be useful (block <b>366</b>). The user next defines the inspection template as the inspection steps using items from the checklist previously setup in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> (block <b>368</b>). The checklist items can either be from an existing checklist or a default inspection template stored on the database. These are the checklist items that are displayed for a selected job area (block <b>192</b>) in the previous discussion of the perform-task event in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The user at this time can edit the checklist items (block <b>370</b>). The server then saves the revised inspection template data onto the database (block <b>372</b>), and determines whether the user wants to continue with the inspection-template-setup event (block <b>374</b>). If so, the process returns back to the option menu (block <b>360</b>). Otherwise, the process simply ends (block <b>362</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0078">To setup the schedules <b>32</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and referring to the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, this event is generally triggered by an external process, such as the one described previously in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> (block <b>376</b>). However, the event can also be triggered by the user of the client <b>12</b> choosing this option on the web page. The process starts (block <b>378</b>) with an option menu of adding new data, editing existing data, or exiting from the event (block <b>380</b>). This event allows the user to setup different schedules and associate them with a selected event, such as an inspection event. The process ends (block <b>382</b>) if the user chooses the exit option. However, if the user chooses the edit option, the server displays the existing schedule data stored in the database to the client for revision (block <b>384</b>). Alternatively, the process continues on to the next step if the add option is selected, which is adding and revising the schedule attributes and description or other useful information (block <b>386</b>). The user next defines the schedule parameters, such as the frequency of the event and whether it is rule based or fixed dates based (block <b>388</b>). The server saves the revised schedule data onto the database (block <b>390</b>), and again determines whether the user wants to continue with the schedule-setup event (block <b>392</b>). If so, the process goes back to the option menu (block <b>380</b>). Otherwise, the process ends (block <b>382</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0079">The detailed steps of carrying out an inspection-processing event <b>40</b> from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. This event is generally triggered by the client sending inspection data to the server (block <b>394</b>) either on the web page or the MCD. More specifically, the client generally sends inspection data to the server, for example, once an inspection is completed by the user on the MCD. The process begins (block <b>396</b>) by validating the sent data (block <b>398</b>). If it is found that the data is invalid (block <b>400</b>), the server will make an entry in the exception log (block <b>402</b>) and the process ends (block <b>404</b>). On the other hand, if the data is valid (block <b>400</b>), the server will save the inspection data on the database (block <b>406</b>). The inspection data is then compared with the allowed pre-defined tolerances from the performance-rating data (block <b>408</b>) to determine whether the data is within the tolerances (block <b>410</b>). If so, the server initiates a notification event <b>34</b> (block <b>412</b>) that allows the server to send a message informing a contact person of the job site of the inspection being within preset tolerances.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">If the routine does not end (block <b>404</b>), meaning that the data is not within the predefined tolerances (block <b>410</b>), it is next determined whether any special action is required (block <b>414</b>). Whether any special action is required depends on the data that were previously defined in all the setup events. The clearinghouse evaluates the data and makes decisions on certain actions based on all the data stored in the database, and sends them to the server for performance when necessary. If no special action is required (block <b>414</b>), the server again initiates a notification event <b>34</b> to the clearinghouse for sending a message to the contact of the status of this inspection (block <b>416</b>). However, if special actions are needed (block <b>414</b>), the server will either initiate a work-request event <b>26</b> (block <b>418</b>) or a work-order event <b>38</b> (block <b>420</b>), depending on the instructions from the data stored in database. When either events are initiated, a message will be sent to the contact person initiating the notification event <b>34</b> (block <b>422</b> and <b>424</b>) to bring the process to an end (block <b>404</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0081">With regard to the notification event described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, and referring to the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the notification event can be initiated at any time during operation of the system. Basically, it is initiated whenever a message is being sent to a specific recipient, the identity of which is dependent on information stored in the database. The process starts (block <b>426</b>) with the server retrieving the recipient information from the clearinghouse (block <b>428</b>), which was gathered from the database. The clearinghouse sends the server only selected data that is needed in order to process the notification event. From that information, the server selects one of the four methods of communication provided as previously defined in the setup events (block <b>430</b>). Specifically, the methods preferably include fax (block <b>432</b>), email (block <b>434</b>), phone (block <b>436</b>), digital pager (block <b>438</b>), and alphanumeric (block <b>440</b>) as examples. However, any of these methods can be excluded, and other methods can also be included. The server sends the recipient a message according to whatever method that is indicated from the clearinghouse (blocks <b>432</b> to <b>440</b>). Next, the server examines the information from the clearinghouse to see if the message should be sent to multiple devices (block <b>442</b>). If so, the process goes back to the selection of the communication method step (block <b>430</b>) and starts over again. Once all the requested communication methods have been utilized (block <b>444</b>), the process ends (block <b>446</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0082">With regard to a work request, it can be made according to the routine shown in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22(</figref> <i>a</i>) through <b>22</b>(<i>c</i>). The event is usually triggered by other events, but can also be triggered by the user choosing this option on the web page or the MCD (block <b>448</b>). The process begins (block <b>450</b>) with the server displaying to the client an option menu with the choices to add new data, edit existing data, or exit the event (block <b>452</b>). If the client wants to exit the event, the process will end (block <b>454</b>) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref> <i>b</i>)). If the client selects to add new data, the server creates a list of job sites that are authorized to the user (block <b>456</b>). It is next determined whether the list is empty (block <b>458</b>). If the list is not empty (block <b>458</b>), it is next determined whether the required job is in the list (block <b>460</b>). If the list is empty (block <b>458</b>), the user is notified of the list being empty (block <b>462</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0083">Furthermore, after the notification to the user (block <b>462</b>) or the required job is not in the list (block <b>460</b>), the server inquires whether the user wants to specify a location (block <b>464</b>) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref> <i>b</i>). If the user does not want to specify a location (block <b>464</b>), the server next inquires whether the user wants to send a message (block <b>466</b>). If not, the process ends at this point (block <b>454</b>). Otherwise, the user can compose a message to the default contact for a work ticket without any job information, or an alternative contact of the user's choice (block <b>468</b>). As a result, the notification event is initiated because a message is being sent (block <b>470</b>), and the process comes to an end (block <b>454</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0084">However, if the user wants to specify a location (block <b>464</b>), the user can enter the location information and description for the work to be performed with the price, payment, terms, approval notice, and due date and time (block <b>472</b>). At that point, the work request without a job association will be saved on the database, and the default contact will be notified of the work request (block <b>474</b>). The notification event <b>34</b> is initiated by the notification to the default contact (block <b>476</b>). The last step is to determine whether the user wants to notify another contact (block <b>478</b>). The user picks another contact from a list from the server (block <b>480</b>), and the notification event is initiated again (block <b>482</b>). Otherwise, the process ends (block <b>454</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0085">Returning to the beginning of the process in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref> <i>a</i>), if the required job is in the list (block <b>460</b>) and the user selects a job from the list (block <b>484</b>) or an existing work request is displayed to the user (block <b>487</b>), the user can enter or edit the description of the work to be preformed with the due date and time (block <b>486</b>). The server determines whether the client wants to contact the default authorized client for this work request (block <b>488</b>). If not, the client picks another authorized client from the contact list for the job site (block <b>490</b>). The server then saves the work request with the selected authorized client onto the database (block <b>492</b>). Next, the server sends the details of the work request to the authorized client (block <b>494</b>), initiating another notification event (block <b>496</b>). The process ends at this point (block <b>454</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0086">If the work-request event originates from the MCD, which is different from initiating the event on the web page, the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref> <i>c</i>) applies. When the work-request event is triggered by the MCD (block <b>498</b>), the process starts (block <b>500</b>) with two options of adding new data or editing existing data, and is generally done during an inspection. For adding new data, the user creates and edits one or more work requests for the job site for which the inspection is in progress (block <b>502</b>). The MCD will scan the inspection data to establish whether the user has permission to create such a work request (block <b>504</b>). If the user does not have permission (block <b>506</b>), the MCD notifies the user (block <b>508</b>) and asks whether the user wants to send a message (block <b>510</b>). If so, the user composes the message to the primary contact of the job site (block <b>512</b>), which the server will send to the contact using the notification event <b>34</b> (block <b>514</b>). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref> <i>a</i>), the process then ends (block <b>454</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0087">Assuming the server displayed the existing data to the client for revision (block <b>516</b>) or the client has permission to create a work request (block <b>506</b>), the user will enter and edit the work request as needed, which might include the description, price, payment terms, approval notice, and due date and time (block <b>518</b>). This information is then saved to the database by the server after the client has finished revising (block <b>520</b>), and the revised data is sent to the designated authorized client (block <b>494</b>) using the notification event <b>34</b> (block <b>496</b>), bringing the process to an end (block <b>454</b>). The use of the authorized client must now process the work request, which is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a flow chart of the work-request-processing event for the designated authorized client of a work request is shown and generally indicated as <b>522</b>. The event begins (block <b>524</b>) with triggering from either the authorized client accessing the web page (block <b>526</b>) or data received (block <b>528</b>). If this is a user initiated session, the server determines whether the client gave a record identifier for the work request being processed (block <b>530</b>). If the client did not supply the server with a record identifier (block <b>530</b>), the server prepares a list of all open work requests to the authorized client for selection (block <b>532</b>). The user of the authorized client selects a work request from the list (block <b>534</b>), and the server will display the selected work request to the user (block <b>536</b>). The user must either accept or reject the selected work request (block <b>538</b>). Alternatively, when the data is sent from an authorized client to the server using a MCD, for example, the server validates the received data (block <b>540</b>). If the data is not valid (block <b>542</b>), the server makes an entry in the exception log (block <b>544</b>) and the process ends (block <b>546</b>). If the data is valid, the user must then either accept or reject the work request.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">If the user of the authorized client accepts the work request, an approval code must be entered by the user, and then validate the approval by entering either a password or pin number (block <b>548</b>). The server will then save the information onto the database and create a work order for the approved work request (block <b>550</b>), which will initiate the work-order event <b>38</b> (block <b>552</b>). If, on the other hand, the work request is rejected, the user preferably requests an explanation and must also validate the request with password or pin number (block <b>554</b>). The server next determines whether the user of the client asks for a revised work request (block <b>556</b>). If not, the process ends (block <b>546</b>). If the user does asks for a revised work request (block <b>556</b>), the server updates the database with the revised work request (block <b>558</b>). As a result, a notification message will be sent to the contact, initiating the notification event (block <b>560</b>). The process then ends (block <b>546</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0090">With regard to the work-order event, and referring to the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24(</figref> <i>a</i>) and <b>24</b>(<i>b</i>), this event is triggered by the user choosing this option or by other events (block <b>562</b>). The process begins (block <b>564</b>) with an option menu from which the user can select to add new data, edit existing data, or exit the current event (block <b>566</b>). If the user exits the current event, the process ends (block <b>568</b>). If the user elects to add new data, the server creates a list of job sites authorized to the current user to add new work orders (block <b>570</b>). It is next determined whether the list is empty (block <b>572</b>). If the list is not empty (block <b>572</b>), it is determined whether the required job is in the list (block <b>574</b>). If the list is empty (block <b>572</b>), the user is notified of the list being empty (block <b>576</b>). After the user has been notified (block <b>576</b>) or the required job is not in the list (block <b>574</b>), the server asks the user if a work request should be created (block <b>578</b>). If the user elects not to create a work request (block <b>580</b>), the routine ends (block <b>568</b>). Otherwise, a work request is created initiating the work-request event (block <b>582</b>) if the user decides to create one (block <b>580</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0091">Returning back to the beginning of the process in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(</figref> <i>a</i>), if the required job is in the list (block <b>574</b>) and the user selects a job from the list (block <b>584</b>) or an existing work request is displayed to the user (block <b>586</b>), the user can enter or edit the description of the work to be preformed with the due date and time of the work order (block <b>588</b>). The server inquires whether the client wants to contact the default recipient of the work order (block <b>590</b>). If not, the client picks another recipient from the contact list for the job site (block <b>592</b>). The server then saves the work order with the selected recipient in the database (block <b>594</b>). Next, the server sends the details of the work order to the recipient (block <b>596</b>), initiating a notification event (block <b>598</b>). The process ends at this point for the work order event (block <b>568</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0092">To process a work order, and referring to the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the work-order-processing event begins (block <b>602</b>) and is triggered by either the recipient using an authorized client to access the web page (block <b>604</b>) or data received (block <b>606</b>). If this is a user initiated session, the server determines whether there is a record identifier available for the work order (block <b>608</b>). If the authorized client did not supply the server with a record identifier (block <b>608</b>), the server prepares a list of all open work orders for the authorized client for selection (block <b>610</b>). The recipient selects a work order from the list (block <b>612</b>), and the server displays the selected work order to the recipient (block <b>614</b>). Alternatively, when the data is sent from a recipient using a MCD to the server, for example, the server validates the received data (block <b>616</b>). If the data is not valid (block <b>618</b>), the server makes an entry in the exception log (block <b>620</b>) and the process ends (block <b>622</b>). Assuming that the data is valid (block <b>618</b>) or that the user updated the existing work order, the server updates this information onto the database (block <b>624</b>). At this point, a notification is sent to the contact person of the job site using the notification event (block <b>626</b>), and the process ends (block <b>622</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0093">In accordance with another important aspect of the present invention and referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the clearinghouse keeps a scheduling process to respond to the scheduled items from a client or an event. The clearinghouse preferably runs this process continuously. It begins (block <b>628</b>) with a timer (block <b>630</b>) that triggers the process (block <b>632</b>). The clearinghouse determines whether the process should end according to the timer (block <b>634</b>). If so, the process ends (block <b>636</b>). However, if it is determined that the process should continue (block <b>634</b>), the clearinghouse reads a scheduled event from a schedule list (block <b>638</b>) and determines whether this is the end of the list (block <b>640</b>). If it is the end of the list (block <b>640</b>), the clearinghouse waits until it is again triggered by the timer (block <b>632</b>). On the other hand, if it is not the end of the list, the clearinghouse responds to the scheduled event (block <b>642</b>). How the clearinghouse will respond to the event depends upon the type of event. In addition to responding to the event in the predefined process proposed in each event, the clearinghouse further sends a notification to the default contact of the schedule event using the notification event (block <b>644</b>). The process then returns to read the next scheduled event (block <b>638</b>), and reruns the process from that point again.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">The general scheme of the monitoring process is shown in the flow chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, which is similar to the schedule process previously discussed. The clearinghouse also keeps a monitoring process that tracks any overdue items and responds to the overdue items accordingly. The clearinghouse also preferably runs this routine continuously. It begins (block <b>646</b>) with a timer (block <b>648</b>) that triggers the process (block <b>650</b>). The clearinghouse determines whether the process should end according to the timer (block <b>652</b>). If so, the process simply ends at this point (block <b>654</b>). However, if it is determined that the process should continue (block <b>652</b>), the clearinghouse reads a check sheet item list that includes any event with a due date and time (block <b>656</b>). The clearinghouse further checks if it has reached the end of the list (block <b>658</b>). If it is the end of the list (block <b>658</b>), the clearinghouse waits until it is triggered by the timer again (block <b>650</b>). On the other hand, if it is not the end of the list (block <b>658</b>), the clearinghouse determines whether the item is overdue (block <b>660</b>). If not, the clearinghouse again waits until it is triggered by the timer (block <b>650</b>). If the item is overdue, the clearinghouse responds to the scheduled event (block <b>642</b>). The clearinghouse responds to the overdue item by sending a notification to the contact regarding the overdue item using the notification event (block <b>662</b>), and the process ends (block <b>654</b>).</p>
