A strength of a second pilot signal transmitted from one of the plurality of neighbor base stations is measured. The first pilot channel strength from the second pilot channel strength is subtracted to obtain a strength difference. It is judged whether the strength difference is greater than the variable threshold value. Performance of an idle handoff according to the judgement result is controlled. In the method, by reducing the number of the idle handoff in a cellular communication system, waste of a battery of the mobile station is reduced, arrival rate of the mobile station is increased, and communication efficiency of a reverse control channel becomes higher.</td><td>6195551</td></tr><tr><td><table></table></td><td>31</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>31</td><td><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6565509.html" target="_blank">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6565509.html</a></td><td>Representative Image:</td><td>Export Citation: Click for automatic bibliography generation</td><td>An analyte monitor includes a sensor, a sensor control unit, and a display unit.

(Naples, FL, US) Coley, Christopher D. (Morgan Hill, CA, US)</td><td>Assignee: GraphOn Nes Sub, LLC (Santa Cruz, CA, US)</td><td>The present invention provides a firewall that achieves maximum network security and maximum user convenience. The firewall employs “envoys” that exhibit the security robustness of prior-art proxies and the transparency and ease-of-use of prior-art packet filters, combining the best of both worlds. No traffic can pass through the firewall unless the firewall has established an envoy for that traffic. Both connection-oriented (e.g., TCP) and connectionless (e.g., UDP-based) services may be handled using envoys. Establishment of an envoy may be subjected to a myriad of tests to “qualify” the user, the requested communication, or both. Therefore, a high level of security may be achieved. The usual added burden of prior-art proxy systems is avoided in such a way as to achieve fall transparency—the user can use standard applications and need not even know of the existence of the firewall. To achieve full transparency, the firewall is configured as two or more sets of virtual hosts. The firewall is, therefore, “multi-homed,” each home being independently configurable. One set of hosts responds to addresses on a first network interface of the firewall. Another set of hosts responds to addresses on a second network interface of the firewall. In one aspect, programmable transparency is achieved by establishing DNS mappings between remote hosts to be accessed through one of the network interfaces and respective virtual hosts on that interface. In another aspect, automatic transparency may be achieved using code for dynamically mapping remote hosts to virtual hosts in accordance with a technique referred to herein as dynamic DNS, or DDNS.</td><td>7249378</td></tr><tr><td><table></table></td><td>152</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>152</td><td><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7189985.html" target="_blank">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7189985.html</a></td><td>Representative Image:</td><td>Export Citation: Click for automatic bibliography generation</td><td>Tracking separation between an object and a surface involves illuminating the surface and reducing the collection angle of light that reflects off of the surface in response to a change in separation between the object and the surface.

The oligonucleotide probe also exists in at least one conformation when hybridized to a target polynucleotide where the quencher molecule is not positioned close enough to the reporter molecule to quench the fluorescence of the reporter molecule. By adopting these hybridized and unhybridized conformations, the reporter molecule and quencher molecule on the probe exhibit different fluorescence signal intensities when the probe is hybridized and unhybridized. As a result, it is possible to determine whether the probe is hybridized or unhybridized based on a change in the fluorescence intensity of the reporter molecule, the quencher molecule, or a combination thereof.

After arrow release, the slide slides back to the stop, which is located close to the rearward end of the arrow. The stop is designed to not touch the arrow rest or the bow handle during release.

The triggering event may be, for example, a sudden change in acceleration indicative of an impending collision, or it may be a change in the signal provided by any such data sensor, including the image sensor. The capture circuit is coupled to the image sensor and captures a signal representing the video imagery by recording it in a digital memory, by transmitting it to a remote location, or by other suitable means. The capture circuit terminates capture of the signal in response to the data sensor circuit sensing a triggering event.

(Logan, UT)</td><td>A device for enhancing removal of liquid from fabric utilizing mechanical and aerodynamic techniques. A base plate contains one or more apertures to which a vacuum is applied for extracting water from the fabric. The total cross-sectional area of the apertures is selected to be that which will increase, and preferably maximize, the extraction power for the vacuum motor with which said base plate is to be utilized. The number and shape of the apertures is selected to reduce the ratio of the total distance along all the perimeters of said apertures to the total cross-sectional area of said apertures in order to reduce boundary layer drag. The cross-sectional area of each of said apertures is selected to be large enough to permit solid contaminants that can be expected to be in the liquid to pass through said apertures without clogging said apertures. Barriers are attached to the bottom of the base plate to force any liquid in the fabric toward the apertures as the base plate is moved across the fabric. And the construction of the barriers is such that each barrier has only a small surface area that will contact the fabric generally perpendicularly to the original orientation of such fabric. This last factor combines with the fact that apertures exist in the base plate, to increase the pressure created when a given force is applied to the Extraction Device and, therefore, to increase the penetration of the base plate of the Extraction Device into a fabric.</td><td>6298577</td></tr><tr><td><table></table></td><td>365</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>365</td><td><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7427659.html" target="_blank">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7427659.html</a></td><td>Inventors: Shukla, Abhinav A.

(Rochester Hills, MI)</td><td>The improved vehicle navigation system and method uses information from a Global Positioning System (GPS) to obtain velocity vectors, which include speed and heading components, for "dead reckoning" the vehicle position from a previous position. If information from the GPS is not available, then the improved vehicle navigation system uses information from an orthogonal axes accelerometer, such as two or three orthogonally positioned accelerometers, to propagate vehicle position. Because the GPS information should almost always be available, the improved vehicle navigation system relies less on its accelerometers, thereby allowing the use of less expensive accelerometers. The improved vehicle navigation system retains the accuracy of the accelerometers by repeatedly calibrating them with the velocity data obtained from the GPS information. The improved vehicle navigation system calibrates the sensors whenever GPS data is available (for example, once a second at relatively high speeds). Furthermore, the improved vehicle navigation system does not need to rely on map matching to calibrate sensors. System flexibility is improved because map matching is oblivious to the hardware, and the system hardware can be updated without affecting map matching or a change in the map database.</td><td>5862511</td></tr><tr><td><table></table></td><td>414</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>414</td><td><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7210016.html" target="_blank">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7210016.html</a></td><td>Inventors: Ware, Frederick A.

When there is relatively no distortion corrupting the plethysmograph signal, the processor analyzes the shape of the pulses in the waveform to determine where in the waveform to generate the pulse indication. When distortion is present, looser waveform criteria are used to determine if pulses are present. If pulses are present, the pulse indication is based upon an averaged pulse rate. If no pulses are present, no indication occurs. The pulse indicator provides a trigger and amplitude output. The trigger output is used to initiate an audible tone “beep” or a visual pulse indication on a display, such as a vertical spike on a horizontal trace or a corresponding indication on a bar display. The amplitude output is used to indicate data integrity and corresponding confidence in the computed values of saturation and pulse rate. The amplitude output can vary a characteristic of the pulse indicator, such as beep volume or frequency or the height of the visual display spike. The visual pulse indicator is supplemented by a signal quality alert. Combined with several indicators of signal quality, the alert is used to initiate a warning when data confidence is very low. The alert may be in the form of a message generated on the pulse oximeter display to warn that the accuracy of saturation and pulse rate measurements may be compromised. A confidence-based alarm utilizes signal quality measures to reduce the probability of false alarms when data confidence is low and to reduce the probability of missed events when data confidence is high.</td><td>6684090</td></tr><tr><td><table></table></td><td>643</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>643</td><td><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/8118561.html" target="_blank">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/8118561.html</a></td><td>Inventors: Bruce, Robert William (Loveland, OH, US) Hanify, John William (West Chester, OH, US) Barbe, Roger O.

Module contacts provide electrical connection to the panel contacts. The panel fixture has protective structures that prevent inadvertent exposure to and short circuiting of the panel contacts. The electrical box is configured for internal placement of the wiring panel, allowing electrical box wiring and verification and electrical system activation prior to wall panel construction. The installed wiring panel has a socket configured to accept a standard AC plug, providing a convenient electrical source prior to outlet module installation. The system also includes a shield configured to fit inside the electrical box and to conform to the wiring panel front side, protecting the electrical box and the installed wiring panel during the makeup phase of construction. After wall panels are installed, the modules can be snapped into the electrical box without the aid of a journeyman electrician. Should a module be damaged at a later date, a homeowner or layman can easily remove and replace the damaged module. The electrical box has an associated box mount providing installation to studs during rough framing of a residential or commercial building. The box mount has a stud alignment guide for accurate placement of the electrical box on a wall stud. In conjunction with this stud alignment feature, the electrical box slides relative to the box mount and is removably locked in one of several fixed positions in order to locate the electrical box front face flush with the exterior surface of wall panels having various thicknesses.</td><td>6341981</td></tr><tr><td><table></table></td><td>662</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>step 4) inventors assignee</td><td>662</td><td><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6410187.html" target="_blank">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6410187.html</a></td><td>Inventors: Luo, Weifang (Norwood, MA) Patel, Bhupendra K.
